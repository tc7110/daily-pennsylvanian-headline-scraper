          "title": "Zara Tena | You should take an ethics class at Penn",
          "article_content": "This semester, I somehow ended up with four out of my five classes being either directly or indirectly about ethics. As a political science major, I was really excited to take these classes, since whenever people talk about ethics nowadays, it mostly has to do with politics or international relations.\nAt a time when our reality changes so rapidly because of technology, and when we are faced with a number of global challenges, some people have forgotten about the importance of acting morally. Especially at a place like Penn, where everyone seems to be extremely worried about their future and their careers, people often disregard these values when they are caught up by the competitive environment. Because of this, one would think that ethics classes would be extremely beneficial for all, but do they actually contribute to making students more ethical individuals?\n\t\tAccording to my professors, they don\u2019t.\nIn all four ethics classes, my professors started the semester by telling us that ethics classes will not make most of us more ethical. I sat there, listening to all of them, and I just could not understand why they would say something like that. If I wasn\u2019t going to learn anything, what was the point of taking these classes?\n\t\t\t\tSEE MORE FROM ZARA TENA:The urgent need for younger voices in politics\ufeffIt\u2019s okay to be ordinaryThat\u2019s where I was wrong: I have been learning a lot. While perhaps the main goal of ethics classes is not to turn students into more ethical people, they definitely give us the tools we need to critically engage with ethical dilemmas. By taking these classes, I might not become a better person, but they have given me a space where I can explore, discuss, and reflect about where I stand on so many issues and what my beliefs about morality actually are.\nEthics is not a subject that can be forcefully taught through lectures and readings. There is no way that we can sit down for three hours every week and magically become more ethical just because we memorize theories and read long papers written by old white men. The goal of these classes is not to tell us what is \u2018right\u2019 or \u2018wrong,\u2019 \u00a0but to give us the skills to navigate the gray areas in ethical decision making.\n\tThese classes encourage self reflection and personal growth. Even when analyzing big case studies or exploring different theories, students are pushed to question their own values, beliefs, and biases. While this may not guarantee that we will completely transform our moral compasses, the self awareness that comes from these reflections creates a great foundation for understanding why we act the way we do and also invites us to try to understand others.\nThe fact that ethics classes begin with a warning \u2014 that you won\u2019t become more ethical by taking them \u2014 should not stop anyone from giving them a chance. The ability to think critically, understand different values and perspectives, and have the skills to self reflect are essential parts of any college education. They prepare students for the complicated moral dilemmas they might face in their personal and professional lives \u2014 especially when most people at Penn will end up with jobs that are notorious for their ethical scandals!\nZARA TENA is a College sophomore studying political science from Puebla, Mexico.

          "article_content": "How many times have you found yourself in a never-ending cycle of back-and-forth messages, trying to pin down a date for a long overdue catch up with a friend? Every get together begins to feel as if it requires intricate planning and strips away the simplicity of social connection. This routine becomes stifling, lacking spontaneity and authenticity; you\u2019re constrained to coordinating with the same faces in the same places.\u00a0\nThis is what I like to call scheduling fatigue.\u00a0\n\t\tAs a result of this phenomenon, gatherings among friends are beginning to resemble scheduled business meetings, meticulously arranged via tools like When2Meet or synchronized Google Calendars.\nWhile resorting to scheduling may seem like the only viable option to maintain a semblance of social connection, perhaps it's time to embrace the idea of venturing out solo: I\u2019m challenging you to go on an unplanned side quest all by yourself to a third place.\u00a0\n\t\t\t\tMORE FROM LALA MUSTAFA:A nation on defense: Dismantling misinformation against Azerbaijan in the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict\ufeff\ufeffAllow me to explain. Picture the first place as your home and the second as your place of education or work. Now, the third place emerges as a public sphere where individuals congregate, not out of any obligation like in the previously mentioned locations, but, for lack of a more precise term, to simply vibe. It could be the cozy corner of a cafe, a communal park, or even the neighborhood barbershop \u2014 anywhere that\u2019ll allow you to interact with people outside your usual circles.\u00a0\nYet, at many universities like Penn, the concept of a third place seems all but lost as our lives remain restricted to school grounds, causing even our first and second places to converge into one. While spots on campus \u2014 like Stommons, Pret, or the cultural centers in ARCH \u2014 can offer some respite, they often come with the latent pressure of being on the clock. Conversations here revolve around assignments, internships, and the intricacies of Penn culture. The chances of an unexpected encounter dwindle given that most people in attendance will be other Penn students. As we\u2019re cocooned in the Penn bubble, it comes as no surprise that many students spend their four years in Philadelphia without ever fully exploring it.\u00a0\n\tYet, this insulation comes at a cost that extends far beyond what we realize.\u00a0\nIt severs our connection not only from the outside world but also from ourselves. That is, within such limits, our individuality dwindles, reducing us to mere roles influenced by our peers. By excluding ourselves from a wider social sphere, we inhibit opportunities to engage with diverse perspectives, trap ourselves in a cycle of familiarity, and risk leading monotonous lives that pave the way to burnout.\nHowever, in our lives, both intimacy and affiliation with broader communities are essential. While intimacy often stems from our immediate circles, affiliation thrives in third places where spontaneous interactions occur. These spaces facilitate easy contact with new individuals on a regular basis, without the need for prior scheduling. As they consistently offer an opportunity for interaction with others, they end up cultivating the most reliable form of socialization.\u00a0\nSo, if you are keen on exploring new horizons and getting involved in the Philadelphia community, I suggest checking out the many informative articles dedicated to bursting the Penn bubble.\nNevertheless, I want to avoid confining third places to physical locations. They\u2019re more of a mindset, a willingness to embrace spontaneity wherever it may arise. They don't have to be far from campus or require spending money. Instead, third places can be any informal spots you visit \u2014 whether it's your student lounge, the library, or a community center.\u00a0\n\t\tGet our newsletter, DP Daybreak, delivered to your inbox every weekday morning.We often find ourselves caught up in the routines of daily life, clinging to familiar patterns of scheduling and social interaction.

          "title": "Beatriz B\u00e1ez | No closed captioning available",
          "article_content": "Columnist Beatriz B\u00e1ez explains her experience with language fatigue at Penn.On my first day at Penn, I called my father in distress, telling him I needed to move back home and study there as I was going to die alone at this university. My father asked why, and I quickly responded, \u201cI haven\u2019t met anybody in three hours. I have no friends. It\u2019s over for me.\u201d\u00a0\nThat very same night, I went to a New Student Orientation event at Houston Hall. As I nervously paced the floor in my Crocs, I overheard some students speaking Spanish and immediately gravitated toward them. Confessing, \u201cI heard Spanish, and I feel saved,\u201d I ended up meeting three genuine individuals, all from various parts of Latin America. Having arrived in the United States, it felt comforting to hear voices that reminded me of home. This comfort is priceless in such a foreign environment.\n\t\tAll my life, I\u2019ve taken courses in Spanish, spoken Spanish at home, and been berated by my grandmother whenever I spoke too much English. Arriving at Penn, I didn\u2019t anticipate the struggle I would face taking classes taught in English, as I had been lucky enough to have been extensively taught English from a very young age.\nBut speaking in a second language most of the time, even as a fluent speaker, is incredibly draining. Meeting native Spanish speakers at Penn was truly a blessing. However, I have found that some people react adversely to me speaking my primary language. These are not continuous reactions of a high degree, but there have been enough small instances to mark me.\u00a0\n\t\t\t\tMORE ON THIS TOPIC:Students celebrate 40th annual Festival Latinx, honoring Latinx culture on campusLa Casa Latina celebrates 2023 Latinx Heritage Month at PennOn various occasions, I have had Latinx friends say, \u201cLet\u2019s speak English so X person doesn\u2019t feel excluded,\u201d or even resort to English for \u201cconvenience\u201d when we\u2019re alone. For the former, I understand the sentiment. I wouldn\u2019t want someone to be excluded from a conversation in such a way. However, when I\u2019m naturally speaking Spanish, having my speech interpreted as a personal offense is off-putting.\u00a0\nIn one instance, I met a student through a mutual friend on a night out. This friend and I speak fluent Spanish; the person I had just met did not. Throughout the night, I had various conversations with my new acquaintance \u2014 who I found quite amicable \u2014 and my friend. I would naturally speak Spanish with the latter, not thinking much of it. The next morning, my friend told me how the new acquaintance felt I hated them for speaking Spanish in front of them, knowing they didn\u2019t speak the language.\u00a0\n\tI was shocked by the assumption and, in all honesty, a little offended. I found it quite conceited that one would think another person is speaking in their first language to actively exclude them. Speaking in a first language, for me, is purely a relief issue. Although I am fluent in English, after an entire week of speaking it, it can be extremely draining; thus, particularly in a social setting, I don\u2019t want to add to the exhaustion.\u00a0\nIt is more than fine to be curious about what somebody is saying and ask for a translation. However, immediately expressing discomfort upon hearing another language and presuming the other person is talking badly about you is inconsiderate toward them. More often than not, this language switch is for comfort. This was the first of sufficient instances that exposed a pattern in my time at Penn. In another class, I grew close to a few other Spanish-speaking students. One of them continuously suggested we switch back to English for seemingly no valid reason and would reply to any comment of mine in English.\u00a0\nThis harsh reality on campus expands into the club scene. In one instance, a native English speaker attended a club meeting primarily led in Spanish. Within this meeting, if club members asked questions in Spanish, any other members who answered quickly switched to English. Evidently, the intent is to have everybody be able to partake in conversation. However, members within a Spanish-led group should be able to detach from English formalities within club meetings, particularly if the club seeks to embrace Latinx heritage.\u00a0\nSpeaking in my primary language is the greatest manifestation of my culture, particularly since Spanish accents are so diverse throughout Latin America. Having to switch to English not only in academic settings but in seemingly every other sphere of Penn life further disconnects me from the culture I\u2019ve been surrounded by my entire life until now. This applies to any person whose main language isn\u2019t English, not only to Spanish speakers.\u00a0\n\t\tGet our newsletter, DP Daybreak, delivered to your inbox every weekday morning.Penn has students from over 100 countries, with around 19% of the student body being international. If one truly wants to immerse themselves in Penn\u2019s multilingual community, one needs to recognize that a language barrier works both ways. Just as an English speaker may be tired from learning another language, a non-English speaker can be drained from constantly speaking English. It\u2019s crucial to recognize that for the latter, multilingualism surpasses a simple language requirement and spills over to nearly every sector of their life at Penn.\u00a0\nLanguage fatigue is a true reality, especially for individuals who haven\u2019t learned English from a young age. Thus, if somebody within your social group is speaking their first language, which you are not fluent in, it does not give you the right to feel offended or urge them to speak in a tongue you understand. And, if you are a non-native English speaker, as much as you can, \"habla en tu primer idioma y que los dem\u00e1s se ubiquen.\"\nBEATRIZ B\u00c1EZ is a College first year studying mathematics and political science from San Juan, Puerto Rico.

And, if white is a moral choice, there is an enormous challenge: then you're challenging an entire civilization,\u201d said James Baldwin.\nWhiteness is the myth we\u2019ve been sold and under which we live. In our instruction at the University of Pennsylvania, we were told to reach for safety and to secure our decadence. So are the students now, but they are not nearly as certain that this is the road they\u2019d really like to walk. The students I knew have already paid that price for that ticket, and their horizons, on a human level, look bleak.\u00a0\n\t\tPhiladelphia is not a college town. It is a real city, a Black city, a poor city whose reality reflects the depth of the American crisis and yet contains the possibilities of its salvation. From the soil of this city rose heroes like Teddy Pendergrass, The Delfonics, McCoy Tyner, and Alfie Pollitt. A friend, then a nursing student who had packed her bags for New York City after graduation and returned a few years later to work in the hospitals, remarked on her return, \"Philadelphia has soul.\"\u00a0\nIn the five years since I\u2019ve graduated, the tone of campus has shifted. Students are developing a new language in order to deal with existential questions: What is the purpose of education and the responsibility of students in the wake of war? More than in my time, it is now clear that we, the students, want to be free. The crisis is deepening, and history is accelerating.\n\t\t\n\t\nFewer illusions are possible for the young mind in Philadelphia, which tempers and sharpens it like metal on metal. What the path to whiteness and an invented safety then produces is a delusional and unfree state. My peers, who are banking, coding, and consulting their lives away, are living as prisoners to the choices they\u2019ve made.\u00a0\nAll the beauty, genius, and potential I witnessed when we were young together, freshman year before the vicious teeth of Penn successfully \u201csocialized\u201d most of us, has been wasted, whittled down into dust, and lost. My old friends might have money, but they didn\u2019t manage to save their souls, and some part of them knows this fact \u2014 that they are perishing. We were never meant to become the fools and tools of the mythic America: the one that is superior, war-hungry, greedy, and hypocritical. These choices did their damage. That was an aberration. Now, we are entering a time of correction.\u00a0\n\tWe want to know the meaning of our lives when we live in a country whose hand assassinates a man and poet as beautiful and courageous as Refaat Alareer, when we live in a society in which Aaron Bushnell had to die so that humanity could live. When the youngest students of Philadelphia stand to say they are no different from the children of Palestine, that the bombs dropped abroad also explode in our neighborhoods, we then know it is true for ourselves \u2014 that we bleed the same as these children in Palestine, as all the men and women we encounter in Philadelphia.\u00a0\nOur bondage to the genocide in Gaza is through the struggle to become moral human beings in America, and to relinquish our country from the myths that strangle us and our people.\u00a0\nIt is unmistakable that the education Penn offers is bankrupt, and that some cancer, invisible but detectable, poisons our relationships to each other and to ourselves. The scramble for acceptance into mediocre clubs and fraternities is insufferable, and the false authority these groups stand on in order to make these judgments is embarrassing.

To investigate and challenge the standards of their education, peers, and professors. And to then act and live by these new definitions, through which we will discover freedom. The world makes us, and we make it, too.\u00a0\nIf we were meant to become the leaders of this country and makers of history, as so many of us have been told from youth into maturity \u2014 that we are capable of this \u2014 then this is our role to fulfill: a brave, original, and purposeful life that skirts the frontier of new standards for this nation.

          "title": "Hanadi Abdulkadir | How poor dining hall food shapes our mental and academic capabilities",
          "article_content": "At this point, many Penn students have lived the terrible dining stories at a number of halls across campus. While it\u2019s important to discuss the health and sanitary risks associated with some of these concerns, it\u2019s also necessary to break down how this problem factors into students\u2019 academic and mental well-being.\u00a0\nOpening Sidechat every few days to see yet another picture of undercooked meat or hearing horror stories from my friends dissuades me from trekking across campus to eat at many of our dining halls. Oftentimes, I find myself skipping meals or stretching the time out between each one \u2014 until I accept the fact that I\u2019ll be eating the same food I already ate a couple times that week. Does this mean that I\u2019m probably missing out on some of the necessary vitamins or fiber I should be getting daily? Probably.\n\t\tNumerous Penn Dining Wellness emails live in our inboxes with tips on improving digestive health and practicing better healthy habits in our daily lives. Additionally, the official page for Penn Dining boasts awards and recognitions for sustainability and top college dining. However, the pristine and glossy promotional pictures of sandwiches, smoothies, and breakfast bowls tell a completely different story from the reality on campus.\nWith two of the most historical repeat offenders \u2014 Hill House and 1920 Commons \u2014 being the only consistent options available for on campus dining during the weekend, it\u2019s much more convenient to resort to the other retail spots scattered around campus. However, some of these locations are far apart, depending on where you live, and can add additional costs to weekly expenses. \u00a0\n\t\t\t\tSEE MORE FROM HANADI ABDULKADIR:\ufeffPenn should require an African American history courseWhy social media and Palestinian activism goes hand in handAdditionally, for students who are dishing out a hefty sum of money to enroll in the dining plan, going out of their way to seek expensive alternatives takes away money that could\u2019ve been better spent elsewhere. Considering that first years and sophomores are required to pick a dining plan for their first two years at Penn, it\u2019s no wonder that students have consistently called for the food standards to match the high prices of these meal swipes. Ideally, no student should feel like they need to resort to options outside of Penn; rather, outside options should be supplemental to an already quality level of options at all dining halls.\u00a0\nSince coming to Penn, my relationship with food has become much more complex. I need to look twice when picking out a seemingly clean utensil to eat whatever is on my plate or stare extra hard at my salad with suspicion before consuming it. But growing up, food was always a way for me to connect with my family and friends, to bring us back together even when we hadn\u2019t seen each other in a long time. Yet the food at Penn, at its worst, has left me frustrated and succeeded at suppressing my appetite \u2014 something I actually can relate to other students about.\n\tAlthough certain foods are scientifically linked to improving mental clarity and focus, I hesitate in reaching for those vegetables because they don\u2019t look as fresh or appetizing when lined up on display in Kings Court English House. As a result, I look for short-term solutions in coffee, which leaves me feeling tired earlier in the day or exhausted while trying to tackle my assignments at night. In order to meet my immediate deadlines, I prioritize some assignments over others, meaning some classes suffer in academic performance and perpetuate an almost never-ending cycle of playing catch-up. I believe that the root cause of all these problems can be traced back to the lack of decent dining.\u00a0\nThis same sentiment has been echoed by many of my friends and peers. But the dining quality at Penn can be mitigated if the University addresses the root problem. Whether that be promoting clean and sanitary workspaces when handling food or streamlining student complaints to Penn Dining other than through email, the University can restore student faith in the system. When it comes to campus dining, Penn can improve upon our experiences by implementing the changes that students deserve to enjoy, especially at the height of midterm season.\nHANADI ABDULKADIR is a College sophomore studying international relations from Philadelphia.

          "article_content": "During Penn\u2019s recent administrative upheaval, the University community found an unexpected silver lining: For the first time, Penn was making headlines alongside Harvard and MIT.\u00a0\nThe presidents of these three institutions were at the center of an infamous congressional hearing in December after their alleged missteps on campus antisemitism. I\u2019ll admit, there is something far more distasteful about chaos at the Capitol than the collective HYPSM prestige.\n\t\tBut many of us are taking our education at Penn for granted, shedding our \u201cque ser\u00e1, ser\u00e1\u201d optimism, and wondering at times what it would be like to go to a more recognizable Ivy. For decades, we\u2019ve all but exhausted our morale by clarifying to passersby that no, Penn State and Penn are not the same university. And yes, Penn is actually active in areas outside of Wharton\u2019s finance programs.\nSo, when Penn Engineering announced its new undergraduate program in artificial intelligence, many of us were enthusiastic about the University\u2019s growing role in the innovation sector: a space thought to be dominated by less business-oriented institutions.\n\t\t\t\tSEE MORE FROM MRITIKA SENTHIL: Removing legacy admissions will align Penn\u2019s actions more closely with its educational missionWhy changing leadership won\u2019t eliminate antisemitism at PennBut Penn\u2019s realization, of possibly its most practical initiative, begs the question: Is the University actually necessary in DevOps? Does sitting in a classroom \u2014 let alone one that\u2019s in the midst of a campus known for its influx of finance bros \u2014 really supersede what can be MacGyvered by a tech junkie with only a laptop, caffeine, and time? I want to give a definite \u201cno.\u201d Otherwise, I would need to hold my classmates and myself accountable for upholding all the exclusivity that comes with attending Penn. And yet, there are a frustrating number of anonymous netizens, D-list journalists, and LinkedIn bards who call Ivy League universities like Penn \u201cout of touch\u201d \u2014 remnants of centuries-old American elitism in an era of bottom-up grassroots movements.\nOne C-suite executive anticipates that \u201cthe best AI engineers and builders won\u2019t graduate Penn Engineering. They'll be global, builders and in the right group chats.\u201d His readers agree, with one commenter further emphasizing that \u201cuniversities cannot keep up with the pace of free market innovation.\u201d When these schools attempt to go against the grain and align with consumer needs, \u201cit genuinely looks embarrassing and out of date.\u201d\n\tIn an environment where the use of AI models is largely democratized, we\u2019re naturally drawn to the trope of a layperson who forgoes bureaucratic systems to channel their intelligence: creating life-changing inventions that would have never come to be under self-serving corporate and political influences. And when ignoring cases of succor \u2014 as mainstream media unfortunately does \u2014 there are many examples of such successes. Bill Gates and Paul Allen, co-founders of Microsoft, were university dropouts. So were Meta Platforms co-founders Mark Zuckerberg and Dustin Moskovitz. As Penn\u2019s over reliance on donors came to light earlier this school year, critics of the upper crust have continued to group Penn with other perpetrators of social stratification. The field of AI is, by nature, continuously evolving. And limiting growth in the discipline to those who can afford, and then succeed in Penn\u2019s Department of Computer and Information Science courses is counterproductive.\nHowever, these narratives misrepresent the intentions of Penn\u2019s AI program.\nTo make a better case for Penn\u2019s AI major, I spoke with Robert Ghrist, Andrea Mitchell Professor and associate dean for undergraduate education at Penn Engineering. He describes how the process of integrating AI in education is similar to the effects of increasing access to music recording and playback technologies. Now, there is \u201cmore music for everyone at much lower prices,\u201d he told me. Nonetheless, \u201cartists at the very top of the industry\u201d are increasingly the benefactors of \u201ca concentration of rewards.\u201d Taylor Swift is, as any current news feed can attest to, perhaps the most prolific embodiment of such phenomena. And professor Ghrist strives to make Penn an incubator of sorts for the \u201cTaylor Swifts of AI\u201d that seek avenues for academic growth, to actually be the \u201cleading edge where the best thrive.\u201d\nAnd to thrive in this discipline, aspiring AI mavens are off course by simply memorizing browser instructions in JavaScript and praying for a tech equivalent of the coveted Goldman Sachs internship. After all, studying AI is a philosophical pursuit: an inquiry into the nature of consciousness and ethics of creating sentient machines. It\u2019s also a political pursuit, for AI poses challenges in regulatory compliance. There are countless possible liabilities for even the most basic ChatGPT input, such as unprotected user data and violations of intellectual property rights. \u00a0\n\t\tGet our newsletter, DP Daybreak, delivered to your inbox every weekday morning.Needless to say, as you might have noticed in my earlier columns, I am not an AI major. I\u2019m not even enrolled in Penn Engineering. Am I, of all students, in the right to quash critics of the Penn AI major when I dropped AP Computer Science in high school (with no regrets)?\nYet, it\u2019s clearly irresponsible to follow the well-intentioned advice from tech capitalists when constant innovation is not particularly ideal for society. Maybe I\u2019m just afraid of a \"Black Mirror\"-esque dystopia, but there is a kind of ominous quality to the idea of highly skilled AI scientists off the reins. Penn, however, is cultivating an ecosystem that nurtures AI talent, albeit not by stifling the next Elon Musk or Sam Altman with red-tape-ridden academics; instead, Penn fosters ethically conscious innovation that addresses complex societal challenges. And so, the fact that I can engage with the Penn curricula across departments has a surprising beauty. The opportunity to become a part of this technological movement \u2014 or, dare I say, revolution \u2014 is the gift of studying AI at Penn.\nMRITIKA SENTHIL is a first year studying management and Russian and east European studies from Columbia, S.C.

Majoring in AI panders to the pre-professionalism Penn is known for and removes many of the foundational elements of the field that underlie innovation.\u00a0\nIn an interesting recent LinkedIn post, David Magerman pondered the implications of a university building complete undergraduate curriculums around a \u201cmodern business tool that is a niche application of computer science, diverting students away from a broad education in computer science.\u201d He went on to ask pointedly, \u201cWhat's next? A Bachelor of Arts in Blogging from the Annenberg School? A Wharton BS in Quantitative Trading?\u201d\n\t\t\t\tSEE MORE FROM AKIVA BERKOWITZ:The newsletter is dead\ufeffIsrael under attack: What do you stand for?As a current computer science major, I\u2019ll admit the AI curriculum looks fascinating. There is such an array of eye-catching electives (from Deep Generative Models to Natural Language Processing) that, if I were doing my degree all over again, I suspect I would have been swayed to switch into the major. But as a recently graduated computer and information science friend put it, the degree \u201cseems like the cool parts of CIS\u201d without the heavier basics like operating systems, computer systems, and physics \u2014 building blocks on the entire computer domain. \u00a0\nThe question I ask myself is whether artificial intelligence is really enough of an independent field that it transcends computer science and necessitates its own major. Is the relatively new field of AI established enough, broad enough, and unique enough such that the skills we gain through taking just those mostly career-focused courses today will undoubtedly remain relevant in 30 years and justify the $84,600 a year sticker price? I simply wonder how likely it may be that AI will become so unrecognizable in 20 or even 10 years, given its breakneck pace of innovation, that students may have wished that their majors in college focused on more fundamental elements of the field that innovators keep turning back to for insight.\u00a0\n\tAside from long-term career effectiveness an AI degree would have compared to computer science or electrical engineering, Penn is known for its pre-professional student body, and this new major shows signs of that sentiment leaking into the curriculum as well. In contrast to the Penn Integrates Knowledge professorships that bring in academic leaders who deeply understand multiple fields to better spark insight between them, this new major filters various courses of study to pluck out the elements we find valuable today.\u00a0\nIn this line of thinking, maybe we should consider the true value of a groundbreaking Wharton degree in quant trading that would promise to \u201csculpt the financial moguls of tomorrow\u201d with unparalleled prowess in algorithmic trading strategies and quantitative analysis.\u00a0\nAll this is to say, I immediately understand the value the current AI concentration within the larger CIS curriculum has. And I appreciate the Ph.D. programs that take students to a higher level of understanding, once they\u2019ve taken the time in their undergraduate training to build the broad foundations. I simply remain curious of the true value an AI undergraduate degree offers us as students over other forms of study within the field and the certain level of indulgence in pre-professionalism that it plays into on Penn\u2019s campus. I truly hope that I\u2019m proven wrong.\nAKIVA BERKOWITZ is an Engineering junior studying computer science from Silver Spring, Md.

          "title": "Eric Najera | Penn must take action to enhance the dining experience",
          "article_content": "As busy college students, most of us do not have time to cook our own meals, and if you are anything like me, cooking is far from your forte. The hassle of having to go to the grocery store, cook, and clean can be time consuming and even more difficult when you\u2019re overwhelmed with classes, clubs, and homework. For the many students without access to a kitchen in their dorm, this presents an even bigger challenge. Luckily, college campuses have dining halls! Students simply swipe their card to get access to an all-you-care-to-eat dining experience. Dining halls provide easy access meals to students\u2014but what happens when that food is inedible?\nAs a picky eater, I know that simply because I do not like a dish does not mean it is unsafe to eat, but food with cockroaches and glass is unsafe for anyone. A seemingly obvious underlying assumption in dining is that food is safe to eat. College dining halls should be a place where students go to eat well-cooked, hairless, and insect-free food. However, that is not the case at Penn: There is a lack of responsibility to make sure the food is meeting basic standards for, let alone satisfying, all students.\u00a0\n\t\tMeal plans are far from cheap. For the sticker price, students would expect quality food, but they would be wrong. Both of the first-year student meal plan options cost $6,330, with the maximum amount of swipes being 296. Each meal swipe equates to roughly $17, which is about the same price as a Caniac Combo at Raising Cane's. As previously stated, Penn dining hall food is far from gourmet, and its price is too high for the quality delivered.\u00a0\nExpensive dining plan meals are not unique to Penn, but other Ivy League schools have similar prices for better quality food. Cornell University offers an unlimited meal plan, so students may visit the dining halls as much as they want with a fixed cost of $6,942 for food ranked second-best in the nation. So, for roughly 600 more dollars, Cornell students have access to unlimited meals and substantially better quality dining.\u00a0\n\t\t\t\tSEE MORE FROM ERIC NAJERA: \ufeffWe should be grateful to attend PennPenn clubs should have an assigned faculty member\ufeffAside from price and quality, weekend dining is another struggle. With the popular McClelland Sushi & Market and Houston Market being closed on Saturdays and the other dining halls closing at 8 p.m., food options are limited. Late-night study sessions means having to resort to local food places that remain open, and unlike nearby schools such as Drexel, our dining dollars do not work at off-campus restaurants and out-of-pocket money spent on takeout can add up quickly.\nBefore every school break, Sidechat is flooded with posts of excitement for home-cooked meals. In my classes, when asked what we are excited for, most students reply being able to eat good food. It is not uncommon for college students to miss their home-cooked meals, but when students are excited to actually eat food that is not served alongside insects, it signifies a problem.\n\tWith Penn\u2019s Bon App\u00e9tit contract still in place, we may not know how much Penn can do to change the dining experience. Safe, clean food should not be an unreasonable expectation. In order to enhance a student's experience outside the classroom, Penn must budget for an edible food experience for all students.\nERIC NAJERA is a College sophomore studying history from Rolling Meadows, Ill.

          "title": "Zaid Alsubaiei | Does Penn\u2019s diversity represent its sense of community?",
          "article_content": "We all know the typical \u201ctypes\u201d of high schoolers, the different clich\u00e9s: Where are my nerds at? But, another attribute of student groups that has become increasingly relevant in the 21st century United States is the diverse ethnic makeup of its population. And, frankly, do we as a campus mirror all that comes with that national trend of diversity?\nThink of the friends with whom you often hang out. Then, ask those friends with whom they usually go out. Finally, think of the groups you are a part of, the extracurriculars in which you partake. Notice a pattern?\n\t\t\u201c[D]espite increased opportunity to live and work in mixed-race settings, Americans remain racially segregated in their friendship patterns,\u201d a study published by the National Institutes of Health found. \u201cSpatial racism, cultural encapsulation, and personal choice are contributing factors for patterns of same-race friendships.\u201d\u00a0\nThis pattern seems to reflect the divisions present in Penn\u2019s social scene as well. Despite coming from all sorts of backgrounds across the world, the University\u2019s students appear to have unconsciously adopted a policy of self segregation. In other words, we like to \u201cstick to our own\u201d by socializing with others to whom we relate to on a cultural, ethnic, or religious basis. So, regardless of Penn\u2019s efforts to integrate people of differing experiences and beliefs, there still remains a degree of resistance by individuals themselves to cross those racial or cultural lines.\n\t\t\n\t\nAs a result, the potential for diversity of thought is threatened. A narrow mindset develops within these groups that students pledge to, and they effectively act as echo chambers that exacerbate already crippling political polarization. We relate to each other less, rely on our \u201cown\u201d more, and become less tolerant of the views, and thus experiences, of those who do not necessarily look, think, or speak like us.\nThis kind of thinking \u2014 whether manifested in the form of race, religion, or otherwise \u2014 has led to serious tension at times and enabled a distorted view of certain communities and how they experience Penn. I attribute part of that thinking not to the identity groups we are a part of, but to how much we value them over who we are as individuals.\n\tHomogenous communities definitely have their place in the college experience: They help ease our transition when we first arrive at Penn, and their role cannot be replaced. I say this as an international student myself, who had a hard time acclimating to an entirely different culture and, most radically, diet. Nonetheless, we should treat these organizations as an aid to finding belonging on campus, not a substitute for individual thought and expression.\nHowever, none of this means individuals can\u2019t agree or always need to separate themselves from the group. The use of a large, collective voice can benefit our campus much more than we realize. What is important to note is that there lies a clear distinction between acknowledging the views of others and forcing ourselves to accept those views for the sake of conformity.\nThere is nothing wrong with disagreeing with the majority, whether it is one against two or one against a nation (though some may try to tell you otherwise). As long as you are respectful and driven by a desire to learn rather than defend, there are no limits on what perspective you may question. So, challenge your beliefs, reevaluate your viewpoint, challenge that of others (no matter who they are), and then reevaluate yourself again. It\u2019ll be hard at first, to express your precise, genuine thoughts without fear. But, remember that you\u2019re not alone (I struggle sometimes myself) and that it\u2019s a process you won\u2019t always get right.\n\t\tGet our newsletter, DP Daybreak, delivered to your inbox every weekday morning.The hardest part of breaking out of groupthink, after realizing it, is talking about it. My advice? Take the plunge and never look back. The next time you are in a group and the majority agrees with an idea you don\u2019t like, let it be known. Talk about it and explain why you think the way you do. Don\u2019t worry if some get offended or others simply do not agree; it is normal and, in fact, expected.\u00a0\nNever forget that disputes you engage in are an opportunity, not a challenge, and our differences are enlightening, not threatening. Only then will we begin to understand and appreciate each other more as unique actors in a truly historic community.\nZAID ALSUBAIEI is a College first year studying economics from Al-Khobar, Saudi Arabia.

          "title": "Eliza Carroll | You are what you read: Sidechat\u2019s impact on campus",
          "article_content": "I downloaded Sidechat this fall after my friends sent me too many screenshots of funny memes or jokes posted on the anonymous app. I figured that doing so would simply remove the middleman. I was already being exposed to the same jokes, memes, comments and judgements as those on the app anyway \u2026 right?\u00a0\nIn December, I returned home for reading days and fell into an easy pattern of studying. Nothing I did was wildly exciting or social, but I instead found myself enjoying the routine and satisfaction of productivity. During my study breaks, I would scroll on Sidechat \u2014 and from the comfort of my home, I felt myself spiraling into anxious dread about returning to Penn. Each time I opened the app, I was faced with a barrage of posts all echoing the same sentiment: Penn is awful and depressing. Without a second thought, I accepted those posts as fact, and in doing so, I allowed Sidechat to have more power than it deserves. In other words, I subscribed to the complaining culture that is pervasive on Sidechat.\u00a0\n\t\tUsing Sidechat, especially without intentional thought, is a way of looking at Penn through hypercritical glasses. Perhaps this is because negativity has been normalized and cynicism gets more upvotes. To some extent, this pessimistic messaging is diluted with the insertion of mildly entertaining memes or jokes, but the result is still the same. With each scroll, Sidechat is perpetuating a defeatist perspective of Penn.\u00a0\nSo, I arrived back at Penn to take my final exam: openly unhappy about returning to what I thought would be a bleak campus as a result of discourse on Sidechat. But to my surprise, it was not horrific, and I was able to enjoy my weekend of studying just as I had my week at home. The sheer volume of disheartening posts on Sidechat had clouded my perspective and ability to see the best in the situation. Sure, I was becoming one with a Huntsman GSR while others were at home enjoying break, but on the other hand, I was with my friends and able to have a sleepy campus all to myself.\n\t\t\t\tAs is the case with most other social media platforms, Sidechat is consumed passively and without a second thought \u2014 it\u2019s used to pass time, curb boredom, and satiate our addictions to our phones. And yet, students are absorbing and internalizing content more quickly than they can truly digest it.\u00a0\nGiven the bandwagon culture on Sidechat, users often build off of one another, creating a chaotic, and often dismal, echo chamber that does not truly represent life at Penn. Whether or not college is the best four years of your life, it is at least what you make of it, and Sidechat enables students to feel like victims of an unknown cause. For those who are actually struggling, Sidechat acts not as a productive outlet, but rather as a meta ether that provides no remedy other than the satisfaction that others are unhappy too.\u00a0\n\tSince winter break, I have in fact deleted Sidechat and am all the better for it. I still get sent the best and the brightest jokes by my friends, but I am no longer overwhelmed by unsolicited complaints on an hourly basis. Without Sidechat, my thoughts on the housing lottery, the floods in the Quad, and upcoming midterms are completely my own. Deleting Sidechat may not be for everyone, but it\u2019s imperative for those who chose to use Sidechat to take a more critical view of what is being circulated and evaluate whether or not they are benefiting from it. It may just change the way they see Penn.\u00a0\nELIZA CARROLL is a College first year studying international relations and art history from Greenwich, Conn.

          "title": "Cathy Li and Liala Sofi | History can\u2019t repeat itself; stand with Chinatown",
          "article_content": "Students for the Preservation of Chinatown protested outside the Board of Trustees meeting held at the Inn at Penn on Mar. 3, 2023. \nA few weeks ago, the streets of Chinatown came to life with firecrackers and lion dances ringing in the year of the dragon. As you walk through the brightly colored 40-foot paifang \u2014 known to most as Chinatown\u2019s Friendship Gate \u2014 you enter into a cultural oasis that has stood strong in the heart of Philadelphia for nearly 150 years. Beyond this fixture, Chinatown serves as a home to nearly 3,000 residents and numerous family-owned businesses, restaurants, shops, and community organizations. Whether you are going to Ken\u2019s Seafood Restaurant for a fun night out or Heng Fa for groceries, Chinatown feels like home.\u00a0\nUnfortunately, this community has been under constant attack for decades and is once again facing the threat of displacement and gentrification from a plan to develop an arena for the Philadelphia 76ers merely a block away. We firmly stand with the Students for the Preservation of Chinatown and urge you to do the same. \u00a0\n\t\tSince the early 1900s, Chinatown has been a victim of gentrification often driven by predatory infrastructure projects. In 1932, the construction of subway infrastructure at Ridge and Eighth streets \u2014 and the subsequent development of the Vine Street Expressway from 1957 to 1991 \u2014 resulted in the destruction of buildings and severe divisions within the community. Bringing in noise and pollution, the expressway eroded neighborhoods and people's quality of life. This was not Chinatown's sole battle, however, as it also faced multiple proposals of developments for a federal prison in 1992, a baseball stadium in 2000, and a casino in 2008.\u00a0\nThe story of Philadelphia's Chinatown mirrors other Chinatowns across the nation. Amid the 1994 fiscal crisis in Washington, D.C., then-Washington Wizards owner Abe Pollin negotiated a deal for the downtown Capital One Arena, where the city covered pre-development costs to acquire and demolish properties. Entrepreneurs in Washington's Chinatown voiced concerns about prices of real estate skyrocketing and parking impacts on businesses in the area. A decade later, most Chinese residents were forced to move out due to unaffordable housing. The parking shortage led to the closure of the last Chinese grocery store, accelerating the decline of the Chinese American population in the area to fewer than 400 residents today. Ironically, as D.C.\u2019s arena now relocates to the suburbs, the community is left behind, having endured irreversible destruction while in the midst of its recovery from the pandemic.\u00a0\n\t\t\t\tMORE FROM LIALA SOFI AND CATHY LI:Liala Sofi | The hypocrisy of billionaire philanthropistsCathy Li | Philadelphia\u2019s changing tastesIn New York\u2019s Chinatown, threats of displacement and economic insecurity also loom high. In 2021, the Museum of Chinese in America accepted a donation of $35 million in support of a borough-based jail complex which would displace Chinese American working-class people in the area. On top of that, its board executives were connected to the closing of the last unionized restaurant, beloved Jing Fong banquet hall, and construction of luxury towers that are actively raising rent and real estate taxes in the area.\nIn Philadelphia, the current 76Place project is being developed by 76 DevCo, an initiative by 76ers managing partners Josh Harris, David Blitzer, and David Adelman. Adelman is at the forefront of the construction of the arena and has promised not to displace the residents or businesses in Chinatown, but his past actions speak louder than his current words. Adelman works closely with Brett Altman, who also owns the University City Townhomes, and was a key figure behind the demolition and end of affordable housing in the West Philadelphia area that was previously known as the \"Black Bottom.\u201d This constant cycle of displacing residents and communities that have lived in the area for generations must end, and we must be the voice to make this happen.\n\tDevelopers of the project have stated that the arena will \u201cserve as a model for an equitable & inclusive community,\u201d yet there is not a single mention of Chinatown in the proposal. Efforts to ensure communities can benefit from this project read as empty promises when nearly 95% of residents, business owners, and visitors oppose the arena\u2019s construction.\nMany questions posed by residents have also gone unanswered by 76 DevCo. How will restaurants and small businesses in the surrounding area be protected? Who will clean the streets after huge events?\u00a0\nPreserving Philadelphia's architectural heritage demands careful consideration in urban development, but the development of the arena does the exact opposite \u2014 jeopardizing accessible low-income and senior housing complexes, healthcare clinics, and schools for children.\nPenn has direct ties to the developers in the area, and students should be cognizant of the situation. Adelman currently sits on Penn Medicine Board of Trustees and is the CEO of Campus Apartments, which houses many Penn students off-campus. But more importantly, Penn students are directly and indirectly involved in the Chinatown community, whether that be Penn Lions performing all throughout the city for Lunar New Year, or student groups like SPOC organizing initiatives to honor traditions celebrating the multi-ethnic communities that reside there.\u00a0\nDespite what greedy developers may suggest, Chinatown is not an ethnic theme park but a home. It\u2019s more than just a place to eat, it\u2019s a support network and a cultural hub for immigrants and visitors alike.\nIn the face of ongoing threats, Chinatown has demonstrated remarkable resilience and activism, advocating for the needs of all diverse communities of color that are integrated into the cultural fabric of our city. The next time you are in Chinatown, take a look around at all the place has to offer. Venture into Ebisu for some home decor and enjoy a Mochinut donut as you shop. Come by Dae Bak for soul-nourishing Korean barbecue. The opportunities to support your favorite restaurants and local businesses are endless.\nPlease don't turn a blind eye to what is happening outside the Penn bubble. Pay attention to what SPOC and other organizers are doing in the fight for the preservation of Chinatown. Educate yourself on what is going on in Chinatowns across the country. If you can, participate in programming like Crane Chinatown Community Center art exhibitions or Show Your Love for Chinatown events to learn more about the challenges facing the neighborhood. Sign petitions. \u00a0\nAdorned with dragon motifs, and gorgeous ornamental roof tiles, the Friendship Archway is not only an architectural masterpiece, but a labor of love \u2014\u00a0created for community by community. The engineers and artisans from Tianjin, China \u2014 Philadelphia\u2019s sister city \u2014 came together with residents and the city of Philadelphia to fund and invest in Chinatown, and you should too.\u00a0\nThe next time you walk through the gate, remember that the fight for Philadelphia\u2019s Chinatown, and Chinatowns everywhere, is not over.

          "title": "Caroline Magdolen | \u201cEveryone cheats.\u201d What can we do about it?",
          "article_content": "My guess is that nearly everyone reading this article knows someone who has been academically disingenuous, or been that someone before. Being academically dishonest isn\u2019t all about flashy examples, like the two admitted Penn students accused of plagiarism and fabricating data in 2022. There are smaller violations that may feel less egregious, or even harmless, like querying ChatGPT for help completing your homework, peeking at a friend\u2019s lab assignment, or answering a PollEverywhere as if you\u2019re in class, when really, you\u2019re snoozing in your dorm.\nAcademic dishonesty is having a moment in the spotlight. The advent of generative AI, the use of which cannot be reliably detected by grading softwares, will likely upend student learning for better or worse. At the same time, examples of plagiarism by prominent academics are being dug up left and right. The former president of Harvard, Claudine Gay, was ousted in part due to plagiarism concerns, and Business Insider found that former MIT professor Neri Oxman (the wife of billionaire Bill Ackman, who led the campaign against Gay) \u201cstole sentences and whole paragraphs from Wikipedia, other scholars and technical documents in her academic writing.\u201d\n\t\tTo be clear, I believe that academic dishonesty at Penn \u2014 going against community standards that your professor has explicitly outlined \u2014 is unacceptable, and that we should be doing more to penalize and prevent it.\nNevertheless, we must also acknowledge that academic dishonesty is understandable, in that we can piece together students\u2019 rationales when they do cheat, and even sympathize with them in some cases.\n\t\t\t\tSEE MORE FROM CAROLINE MAGDOLEN:\ufeffThe Rat Kings of PennThere\u2019s no better time for climate education\ufeffTo dissuade academic dishonesty, we employ sayings like, \u201cIt will only hurt you in the long run to cheat,\u201d or \u201cYou\u2019re taking advantage of other students who've completed their work fairly.\u201d This is true in some circumstances. If you\u2019re an aspiring quant and you\u2019re asking ChatGPT to calculate all of the derivatives on your MATH 1400 homework, it\u2019s going to show: First in your exams for the class, then in every math class you take thereafter, and especially in your future career. And if MATH 1400 is curved, your dishonest success capitalizes on the honest failures of others \u2014 not cool.\nBut this is not true in all cases. Jane* was a first year in her spring term when she was taking CIS 1210: Data Structures and Algorithms \u2014 a famously challenging CIS course \u2014 with Rajiv Gandhi, a famously challenging professor.\u00a0\n\tShe cheated on her coding assignment late into the semester, and as per the professor\u2019s policy, received a -300/100 on the submitted homework and zeros on all previously submitted homework, receiving a D as her final grade in the course.\nBut Jane believes that what is more important to her story is not what happened, but why it happened.\u00a0\n\u201cWhat drove me to make a bad decision? Why are [these classes] so infamous? It\u2019s because of notorious policies where you cannot collaborate on many assignments. You are given long problem sets to do, on your own, each week, with desperate students in office hour queues that are two to four hours long. Many times, you will go to the TA and not get a clear answer. It is a profoundly isolating situation, particularly for freshmen just entering college, and that\u2019s what drives well-meaning people to cheat.\u201d\nBased on my conversation with Jane, it seemed that she felt isolated at the time and was struggling to reach out for the support that she needed, both in CIS 1210 and at Penn as a whole. And given the limited support Jane could receive from TAs and her instructor, backtracking her friend\u2019s code felt more conducive to her learning than doing nothing.\nJane expressed a lot of remorse over what happened, and said that she still has a lot of respect for Rajiv, maintaining a good relationship with him to this day. She was also grateful that Rajiv was willing to handle this internally, since a low grade in the class looks better than a formal statement on her transcript, detailing her violation of academic integrity.\n\u201cI deserved to be punished harshly,\u201d Jane said. \u201cBut the collaboration policies of these introductory courses, and the punishment I received, wrecked my self-esteem and my early college experience. I felt that there was no way out.\u201d\nAccording to Jane, Rajiv's philosophy is to \"let go of your grades early: the sooner you stop caring about your GPA and start caring about learning, the better.\" She agrees with this philosophy, especially since he curves his courses generously, but sees this as out of touch with the realities of many Penn students.\nAfter students have prioritized perfecting their grades and resumes (and have been praised for it) in high school, those habits won\u2019t get undone overnight. Even at Penn, there are many institutions and accolades that continue to reward \u201cperfect\u201d performance over pursuing difficult academic disciplines, experimenting, and invariably messing up sometimes.\nFrankly, for a pre-med student in computer science (a track which Jane was considering at the time), the adage that \u201ccheating will hurt you in the long run\u201d skill-wise doesn\u2019t hold much water. The skillset of a future doctor and a software engineer just don\u2019t overlap enough. What can hurt a pre-med in the long run is a low GPA.\nAnd while there are some students for whom projects, internships, and technical interviews will get them a lot further in guaranteeing their success, this is not true for everyone. For many preprofessional students who may want to challenge themselves with a major or minor in CIS, they risk getting shut out of the study altogether.\nWhat frustrates me most about this entire situation is not that such harsh action was taken, but that it appears ineffective in tackling the issue at hand. If a student wanted to cheat, they could just take CIS 1600 or CIS 1210 during a different semester, when a different instructor was in charge and penalties were anecdotally known for being less harsh.\nWhile Jane\u2019s actions were clearly wrong, I can\u2019t help thinking that she was just the unlucky example that had to face the music, and she said as much in our interview: \u201cEveryone cheats in this class. You don\u2019t survive [CIS 1600 or CIS 1210] without talking to people, it just depends on whether you get caught. That doesn\u2019t make cheating okay, but it does mean that we need to rethink how these courses operate.\u201d\nSo, what can we do so that not everyone cheats?\nThis is a complex question, and there is no easy answer. It is crucial that as we frame the issue of academic integrity violations, we look at both the violations themselves and the root motivations that drive them \u2014 these actions are not taking place in a vacuum.\u00a0\nAcademic integrity violations these days are, to an extent, simply easier to commit. ChatGPT has led to a surge in \u201cunfair advantage\u201d violations. And even before generative AI, the pandemic had uprooted our usual test-taking environment. Now that classes are in person again, we no longer need to have take-home or open-Internet exams, but these still persist in some classes, and are easier to cheat on. Penn, given its history of fraudulent alumni, isn\u2019t going to be a place where professors can blindly trust students to refrain from cheating when presented with the option, so professors should take some responsibility for leveling the playing field in the classroom too.\u00a0\nJulie Nettleton, the executive director of Penn\u2019s Center for Community Standards and Accountability (CSA), relayed over email that CSA already works closely with schools and centralized resources at Penn to discuss how to proctor exams, and with faculty to discuss exams, syllabi language, and classroom policies.\nWhat constitutes a violation itself is currently not standard across classes, or even across different sections of the same class. How to handle a concern of academic integrity falls to the professor first \u2014 this is how Jane completed CIS 1210 with a lower grade, rather than a formal sanction from the CSA. It makes sense to delegate this responsibility to professors: It is more efficient than having the CSA handle every case, and professors should have the freedom to decide what constitutes cheating in their classrooms.\nHowever, this does open the door to students deliberately choosing sections of a course with professors that have more relaxed academic integrity policies. Conversely, some professors can be overly harsh, to the point where they are acting unfairly towards their students.\u00a0\nJill*, another student that I interviewed for this article, was falsely accused by her professor of collaborating on her final exam with her peers. At the start of winter break, the professor sent a class-wide email imploring those who worked together on the take-home exam to turn themselves in or have the matter escalated. Jill recalls that for students that turned themselves in, the professor lowered their grades accordingly \u2014 everyone else was reported to the CSA.\nIn the end, Jill\u2019s name was cleared, but she was assigned a case manager that seemed to have assumed she was guilty by default. As the case progressed, many of the details that the professor used to build the case against her appeared superfluous \u2014 for example, she and her friends had all rounded to the same decimal place in their work. Jill suspects that the escalation may have been personal: she had previously asked the professor, on behalf of the class, if he could make changes to his teaching style to facilitate learning.\nIt seems wrong to me that a professor could accuse a student and cause such extensive stress when in the end, Jill turned out to be innocent. It reminded me of some other methods that professors use to catch students cheating, such as Turnitin\u2019s flawed AI detector.\nPart of the solution to rampant academic dishonesty may also lie in expanding our vocabulary to discuss the issue, as John McWhorter pointed out in The New York Times. A class-wide cheating ring, direct plagiarism of original ideas from a paper as one\u2019s own, and copying a line of someone\u2019s code all constitute academic dishonesty, but range broadly in terms of severity and \u201cease of catching.\u201d However, this is rarely reflected in academic integrity policies.\u00a0\nIt can be awkward to suggest that some forms of dishonesty are worse than others, and more awkward still to draw the line between different punishments for different violations, but we must still have these conversations.\u00a0\nWhat should constitute dishonesty at all? When speaking with Jane, she would often circle back to how isolating it was to work alone on her assignments as a first year in introductory computer science courses, particularly as a woman in STEM. Every day, she would walk out of class \u201cfeeling way worse about [her]self.\u201d Now exploring chemistry, physics, and biology courses, she greatly appreciates the change in her academic environment, where students are encouraged to openly collaborate. The grade medians in chemistry are similar to those in CIS (which is to say, not great), but Jane is not as stressed as she was in CIS 1210, since she studies with her friends, and they can struggle and ask for help together.\u00a0\nWhile it was dishonest of Jane to copy code when it was against CIS 1210 policy, perhaps CIS majors and minors would learn more from the course if they were in a more collaborative environment to begin with. Jane has suggested that CIS 1210 should find a middle ground where students can learn from each other, but not be overly reliant on collaboration to perform well on exams.\u00a0\nShe also argues that there should be more opportunities for students to admit to academic dishonesty \u2014 through a friend at Stanford, she heard that at the end of a computer science class, students can select the assignments they have cheated on and receive a negative score on them, or risk facing more uncertain penalties if they are later caught.\u00a0\n\u201cThis policy gives people a second chance to do the right thing, and I do believe that you learn from an experience if you own up to it,\u201d Jane said.\nDeliberations over how best to address academic dishonesty can go on without end, but unfortunately this column must do just that. So here, I want to leave you with a reminder of what I said at the beginning: Academic dishonesty is unacceptable, but it is also understandable.\n\t\tGet our newsletter, DP Daybreak, delivered to your inbox every weekday morning.The hard, but necessary, solution to \u201ceveryone cheating\u201d is taking a good look at the stories behind academic dishonesty, and listening to the students involved with sympathy.

          "title": "Jack Lakis | What we can learn from Penn\u2019s college ranking",
          "article_content": "Last fall, a plethora of new results from U.S. News & World Report, Wall Street Journal, and Forbes elevated Penn in their national college rankings. Nearly every list places Penn among the top 10, some going as far as placing the University among the top five. This universal growth resulted from a key change in most of these sources\u2019 metrics: greater consideration given to postgraduate salaries.\nPenn famously has one of the highest-earning alumni bodies in the country. Starting salaries for Penn graduates are often considered the highest in the Ivy League. By mid-career, the average Penn alum is raking in $165,000 annually, while the national average for a college graduate caps out at $74,000.\n\t\tPenn draws a great deal of prestige from its potential to produce high earners, which is a direct result of our school\u2019s preprofessional culture. Nearly 50% of all Penn graduates enter one of two career fields: consulting or finance. This pipeline allows most Penn alumni to matriculate into high-paying jobs shortly after graduation.\nI\u2019m usually a defender of preprofessionalism. It\u2019s crucial that Penn graduates are able to find good jobs, and high salary potential is an immense advantage. But those jobs aren\u2019t everything. Many universities are making gains in rankings and name recognition based on alumni outcomes in public service careers.\n\t\t\t\t\ufeffSEE MORE FROM JACK LAKIS:\ufeffDo we all hate Penn?Staying focused after Magill's resignation\ufeffFor example, Harvard University boasts about its eight presidential alumni. However, when 1968 Wharton graduate Donald Trump was elected president, Penn mostly ignored his history with the school. Given his proximity to controversy and his unconventional political history, Penn\u2019s bump in prestige was limited by Trump\u2019s election. Our second closest claim to the White House is the University\u2019s relationship with President Joe Biden and the opening of the Penn Biden Center. I argue that this is as far as Penn\u2019s ties to the presidency will go. Nowadays, Penn\u2019s laser focus on professional development might repel students who will one day have presidential potential.\nComparable institutions to Penn have high-earning graduates and prestigious placements throughout the government, nonprofit sector, and the advocacy space. For example, Georgetown University feeds graduates into congressional offices and many Fulbright programs. Princeton University also regularly features its flashy roster of graduates in powerful political offices. These universities maintain a strong presence in the private sector but are also actively represented in government positions.\n\tIn these examples, the institution itself sponsors an undergraduate school dedicated to public service. At Georgetown, it\u2019s the School of Foreign Service, while at Princeton the role is filled by the School of Public and International Affairs.\nI propose that Penn follow suit and create a fifth undergraduate school dedicated to public affairs. This new school could absorb Penn\u2019s wildly popular social science programs, like PPE (Philosophy, Politics and Economics), Political Science, and Economics. Currently, most students in these majors are scooped up by consulting firms and investment banks. If these students were given an intentional focus on service and social responsibility, perhaps they could feel empowered to use their degrees in a more meaningful way.\nThe least Penn can do is expand its current effort to bridge the gap between social science degree seekers and careers in government and nonprofits. It\u2019s crucial that our student body actively engages with the robust policy infrastructure that Penn has already made available: Civic House, Perry World House, opportunities like Penn in Washington, and extracurricular engagements offered by the Government and Politics Association. From what I\u2019ve seen, these resources are underutilized at Penn. By snubbing them, Penn students are working against the general interests of the University to gain prestige.\n\t\tGet our newsletter, DP Daybreak, delivered to your inbox every weekday morning.Besides, it's about more than just rankings. We have the potential to empower our students to become leaders in society. TIME Magazine ranks Penn as the third-best college for aspiring leaders. However, the article states its rationale for this placement as a concentration of graduates in business careers. Other chart-topping schools on this list were noted for their programs in law, medicine, and more.\nUltimately, private sector homogeneity marks one of Penn\u2019s key weaknesses. As we move forward, Penn has a duty to educate leaders in more than one field. If Penn strengthened its programs in civic engagement, more graduates would be inclined to pursue roles in government and could elevate Penn\u2019s cultural stature. We should be known for more than salaries. We can do more than business.\nJACK LAKIS is a College first year studying political science from Kennesaw, Ga.

          "title": "Mia Vesely | Black Penn is vibrant this month and every month",
          "article_content": "As of late, most of my columns have focused on things I take issue with: Whether it\u2019s Liz Magill\u2019s resignation and the threats to free speech on campus, or the lack of racial diversity in Panhellenic sororities. I haven't highlighted the things that I truly appreciate and, more specifically, the places in which I\u2019ve found community at Penn.\nLast February, I argued that Black history is important for everyone. Education surrounding Black people, their lives, and their contributions should be integrated into the standard curriculum. Black Penn shows up and shows out every month, but this month in particular, there are many events and ways that Penn student organizations uplift the community and come together.\u00a0\n\t\tIt would be impossible to touch on all of these amazing events and their impacts, but I\u2019d like to paint a picture of some of these groups and their initiatives during this month and beyond. Planning for these events takes months. For example, when Descendants of Afro-Americans at Penn (DAAP) \u2014 a club founded just last year \u2014 put on their first-ever gala on Feb. 1 to kick off the month, you better believe that the event was well-planned and executed.\u00a0\nThe gala \u2014 Red Carpet For A Cause \u2014 supported the Sickle Cell Disease Association of America's Philadelphia and Delaware Valley Chapter. The night included catered food, live performances from student groups like The Inspiration, wonderful community, and beautiful decor\u2014even including an ice sculpture of the DAAP logo. Over $1,700 was raised in support of the foundation.\n\t\t\t\tSEE MORE FROM MIA VESELY:\ufeffI dropped sorority rush and I\u2019m gladFirst Liz Magill, next free speechWhen asked about the impacts of the event, College sophomore and DAAP founding member Clarke Dickens said, \u201cWe wanted to bring the community together for a great cause, especially a cause that affects a lot of African Americans and Black people more broadly.\u201d\nSickle cell disease occurs in about one in every 365 Black babies born in the United States. The percentage of Black people who carry the trait is even higher, with one in 13 Black babies being born as carriers.\n\tDickens is not just involved with DAAP, but is also on the boards for QBlack and Shea Collective.\nThese clubs are all part of something commonly dubbed \u201cBlack Penn,\u201d which focuses on so many different aspects of identity. From cultural organizations like Penn African Student Association (PASA), to preprofessional organizations like Black Wharton and the Black Pre-Law Association (BPLA), to community service organizations like the NAACP, all of these organizations put an emphasis on service both inside the Penn community and out.\u00a0\nFor example, Campus Curlz \u2014 a club I serve on the board of \u2014 is, at first glance, a club centered around uplifting natural hair and embracing positivity. \u00a0But underlying hair mask making events and movie nights, there is a strong commitment to service. Just this month, the community service committee held an event where we made Valentine\u2019s Day cards for senior citizens at Mercy Life West Philadelphia.\nService by board members is a requirement to be part of funding organizations like UMOJA \u2014 the umbrella funding organization for Black clubs \u2014 and even beyond that, many clubs center service in every activity they partake in. Whether you\u2019re on the board of a club or not, there are many service opportunities available and encouraged.\nWhen asked what they wish people knew about Black Penn, Dickens said, \u201cClubs should make an effort to include grad students, it makes all the difference. I\u2019m able to say, \u2018This is what I would look like coming here for grad school,\u2019 and it can even offer opportunities for mentorship.\u201d\nWhat seems to drive Black Penn is first and foremost the students, then the supportive and involved faculty, as well as the local partnerships and opportunities the clubs find, build, and pursue for themselves. Many members of the DAAP board are native to Philadelphia, so that makes their work even more personal.\nWhile Black students do take initiative to realize what they need and create the spaces they want to see, there is so much room for improvement on behalf of Penn: whether it\u2019s stratifying the way funding is given to these clubs \u2014 they often can\u2019t fund silverware in UMOJA meetings if it can be provided elsewhere \u2014 or improving the cultural spaces available to students (we were promised the ARCH \u2018building,\u2019 not the ARCH \u2018basement\u2019). In months like February, Penn aims to spotlight their Black students. I just wish this recognition of the incredible community Black students forged for themselves, when they initially didn\u2019t see it on campus, came year-round.\n\t\tGet our newsletter, DP Daybreak, delivered to your inbox every weekday morning.Events like DAAP's gala happen every month, and it\u2019s important not to understate the role these organizations play in making Penn a welcoming and accepting place for students from marginalized backgrounds.\nI was happy to see Faces of Black Penn \u2014 a Black-run publication \u2014 highlighted in the DP last week. I hope people continue to uplift the work of these student groups going forward and make space to give all students their roses. Black History Month is not over, and the time to appreciate Black students and their work does not end come March.\nMIA VESELY is a College sophomore studying philosophy, politics, and economics from Phoenix, A.Z.

          "title": "Bernadine Kumi | I joined a sorority and I\u2019m glad",
          "article_content": "I\u2019ll be honest: I was not a fan of Greek life when I first got to Penn. My perception of Greek life was influenced by growing up in the South, mainly in suburban Georgia. This included a sorority scene of girls with fake spray tans and little to no personality. The images of sorority girls from the University of Georgia and Alabama screamed no diversity, which made me wary of joining a sorority at Penn. Being a First-Generation, Low-Income (FGLI) student made me especially hesitant. Even more so, coming from a Ghanaian household, the notion of a sorority was immediately dismissed as something against our Christian values. Thus, during my first year, I knew I would never, and I mean never, join a sorority.\u00a0\nHowever, by the beginning of sophomore year, my mindset began to change. After a year on campus, I had found a solid community of a small group of friends. But beyond that, I felt that I did not really know anyone. I couldn\u2019t name more than 20 people in my grade. Penn is known for being a networking school, and the \u201cSocial Ivy,\u201d so I began to question just how much I had taken advantage of that. That, along with most of the underclassmen party scene revolving around fraternities, made the idea of rushing even more appealing.\u00a0\n\t\tSo while most people were beginning their sophomore year with the friends they already had, I began to look for additional friends. My twin sister, who also goes to Penn, and I began attending open rush events, talking to sophomores in sororities, and involving ourselves in more social events. Over the next few months, my days consisted of talking to many girls, going to dinners, and putting myself out there in a way that I had been hesitant to do before. I made new friends, met fellow sophomores also in search of a bigger community, and found myself loving the idea of joining a sorority.\u00a0\nBut what made me even more eager was just how inclusive and diverse sororities were at Penn, more so than I had been expecting\u2014especially the off-campus sorority I ended up joining, OAX. I was still wary about rushing, but as soon as I got to the first event, I immediately felt comfortable. There were girls with different interests, passions, economic backgrounds, and personalities. Not a single conversation felt forced. Every girl I met had a unique and authentic story, and I felt like I could talk to them for hours.\n\t\t\t\tSEE MORE FROM BERNADINE KUMI:\ufeffDining hall workers at Penn Hillel demand better treatment from UniversityI was especially captivated by BLOAX (Black OAX), a community within OAX that includes fellow girls of Ghanaian descent and other Black girls who provided me with guidance on navigating Penn as a Black woman. OAX also has other smaller communities, such as LatinOAX and RainbOAX. Being able to find other people with similar backgrounds made the choice to join a sorority that much easier.\u00a0\nAs a FGLI student and Questbridge scholar, the idea of paying high dues out of my minimal work paychecks every month was unfathomable. I knew that joining a sorority would pose another financial burden, and even though I was loving the OAX community, the idea of paying dues scared me. Yet once again, OAX and other sororities surprised me with their understanding and financial transparency. They worked with me to develop an affordable monthly payment plan so that I, like every other girl interested in rushing, could also enjoy being in a sorority.\u00a0\n\tSince the morning of Bid Day when I got \u201cthe call,\u201d I know that I truly made the right decision by joining a sorority, for not only my social life but my professional life too. This past fall, I was able to land a summer internship in Los Angeles with the help of my grand-big. I was also able to prepare for my interview with girls in my sorority, who gave me the confidence I needed to land the opportunity. As a Black woman and FGLI student, I have truly benefited from joining Greek life. I hope students who are hesitant to rush, just as I once was, will see my experience and how transformative it can be. I hope others \u2014 whether they are Black women, FGLI students, or just Penn students in search of a greater community \u2014 can do the same.\nBERNADINE KUMI is a College junior studying political science and legal studies and history from Roswell, Ga.

          "article_content": "Columnist Jessey Shin explores the problem of disparate advising quality in the College and argues \nfor a more standardized experience.\u201cMy advisor lied to me?\u201d\nI remember someone saying this to me in complete disbelief, but I can\u2019t say I\u2019m surprised. Advisors can be as misleading as they are helpful, and this is a widespread problem that needs addressing.\n\t\tIn the College, students typically have between 15 and 20 credits outside of their primary major to meet the graduation requirement. These are used to fulfill general education requirements, pursue a second major or minor, or take elective courses that align with a student\u2019s interests.\nThe freedom to pursue one\u2019s intellectual pursuits is, of course, one of the draws of the College. I am looking to pursue two majors myself, in somewhat interconnected but disparate fields of study: the flexibility offered by the curriculum allows me to explore these interests without taking an obscene number of classes.\n\t\t\t\tSEE MORE FROM JESSEY SHIN:Making a case for the less popular college housesNavigating the maze of Penn's resources\ufeffThe problem is few students go into their first year knowing which major they would like to pursue, much less exactly which courses to take.\u00a0\nThe College puts a lot of effort into informing incoming students about the curriculum and what they have to offer, such as through the Compass module on Canvas that gives a foray into some aspects of the College experience (something that other schools do not offer). However, the sheer number of options can be overwhelming, giving rise to a unique need for personalized, one-on-one guidance. This is where pre-major advisors come in.\u00a0\n\tPre-major advisors, assigned to each student before they start their first semester at Penn, are a vital resource for College students. They guide students through the course selection process, encouraging and helping them as they explore their various interests and eventually settle on a major.\nI can say that I have had a relatively good experience with my pre-major advisor. However, I also found that some of the advice offered was not fully applicable to my circumstance, because of the recent transition from Penn InTouch to Path@Penn.\nOther students, however, are not as lucky. I have heard stories about advisors making their students cry, spreading misinformation, jeopardizing their advisees\u2019 course registration, you name it.\nIn an interview, one student (who requested anonymity) shared that they have had trouble reaching their pre-major advisor from the get-go. College students must meet with their advisor one-on-one to get their course registration hold lifted; without this, they are not eligible to participate in advance registration. The student was only able to reach their advisor a day or so before the deadline and has continued to have trouble with availability.\nOf course, their pre-major advisor experience was less than ideal. \u201cHer guidance wasn\u2019t so much guidance as it was looking at the boxes and seeing if I checked them,\u201d they said. \u201cI don\u2019t think I would feel comfortable going to her for personal issues, such as which major to pursue or how to explore [some of my interests], because I don\u2019t think she would point me [in] the right direction.\u201d Instead, they had been utilizing their PennCAP advisor (available for FGLI students) for these concerns.\nOn the other hand, some students are able to form a positive relationship with their advisor and find that they are helpful in navigating their interests. Rishi Dadlani, a College first year, described his advisor as \u201cfriendly and helpful. He gave me his phone number and told me to contact him if I [had] any questions \u2026 If I saw him around campus, I would say hi, and he always sends us a beginning-of-semester email.\u201d\n\t\tGet our newsletter, DP Daybreak, delivered to your inbox every weekday morning.This disparity in advising quality means that some students are at a great disadvantage compared to others. While some advisors are able to \u201cpoint students in the right direction,\u201d helping them take the right step forward in their college experience, others fall short. Their advisees must navigate the complicated process of learning about the majors, gen-ed requirements, and figuring out (the surprisingly difficult) advance registration process on their own.\nWhen done right, the freedom of the College curriculum can allow students to truly delve into their academic interests and eventually settle on the right path for them. However, that process requires a lot of research and planning that is supposed to be aided by a pre-major advisor. For incoming first years who are unfamiliar with the landscape at Penn and underclassmen students, this disparity in advising quality poses a challenge. Penn must ensure that all students are able to best utilize the resources at their disposal, and the first place to start is with the guidance they receive.\nJESSEY SHIN is a College first-year studying sociology and communications from Seongnam-si, South Korea.

This month offers an opportunity to delve into the depths of history: exploring narratives that challenge, inspire, and provoke thought. In the spirit of true academic inquiry and in honor of this significant month, I wish to highlight a selection of works by Black authors whose perspectives might diverge from the more commonly embraced interpretations of Black history and culture.\n\t\tIn recommending these texts, my intention is not to endorse every opinion expressed by the authors, but to underscore the importance of engaging with a diversity of viewpoints. These authors challenge us to look beyond the prevailing orthodoxy and to question the narratives that have become commonplace within academic circles. They remind us that the Black American experience, like any aspect of human history, is richly diverse and complex.\nAs members of an academic community that prides itself on intellectual rigor and openness, it is our responsibility to explore a broad spectrum of perspectives, especially those that provoke debate and reflection.

          "title": "Francesco Salamone | Is Penn about liberal arts or elite jobs?",
          "article_content": "\u201cWelcome to Penn! You are the most diverse class we ever admitted!\u201d The convocation rhetoric makes you feel so special. Penn is diverse because a student comes from Wisconsin and another from Kazakhstan. One plays the flute, one plays squash. Never mind that all of them want to be bankers or consultants. I wish someone had told me that nearly every other person sitting at Convocation with me would end up in the funnel. That however diverse my first-year class was, my senior class would simply not be.\nAs a teaching assistant for Wharton\u2019s required \u201cBusiness and You\u201d leadership course, I mentor first years adjusting to college and exploring careers. Someone confessed, \u201cIf not banking, then what else could I possibly do?\u201d If the best business school in the world (U.S. News debates aside) makes you believe you only have one option from day one, the institution, culture, and entire system have fundamentally failed.\n\t\tOf course, there is nothing wrong with those jobs: The last thing we need is a trembling economic system and inefficient markets. The problem is blindly assuming that one in two employed Penn grads and 80% of Wharton grads woke up and consciously made such a decision. Unpacking our culture proves how little of a decision this is and how everything revolves around two words: prestige and control.\nIt is common knowledge by now that Penn students are privileged. However, you may not know that for every single student from the bottom 20%, over 21 people come from the top 20%, blithely offsetting their upbringing. The result? An abject elite detached from reality. Okay, perhaps this is cynical, but if we are known for our elitist \u201cseeing and being seen\u201d culture, is it a surprise that 25% of us are so disillusioned to think the average U.S. salary is above six figures? Of course not (both not surprising and not true).\n\t\t\t\tPenn\u2019s alarming lack of socioeconomic diversity (despite efforts acknowledged this) unequivocally creates a culture perpetuating the value of money at the expense of everything else. The people you sit next to in class distract you with their laptop screens: purchasing a Gucci bag or booking Airbnbs in Cancun. The emails you receive are about banking and consulting events. This is the model. The only one. The only one, right?\nLet\u2019s be honest, \u201cjust follow your passion\u201d won\u2019t pay the bills, and I cannot blame an indebted or underprivileged student for desiring financial freedom with a high-paying job. This is why I am not saying the Wall Street lifestyle is unethical, although like others, I could. I am saying this is only one way to live your life. One of infinitely many. Which one makes sense for YOU?\n\tEveryone at Penn is good at planning, several are good at doing, and almost none are good at reflecting. The purpose of your college education is not exclusively career preparation. If this is what they had you do, I hate to tell you that you have been robbed. As writer William Deresiewicz argues, \u201cWhat you should want to develop in college is the habit of reflection, which means the capacity for change because most of what you come across in college will inevitably fade from memory. What is left over, precisely, is you.\u201d A culture, even more so an institution, should give you the tools to understand what model of life you want to live, not impose the model on you.\nYet, my student's question is central and inevitable: What else if not banking?\nAsking yourself what truly energizes you is no easy task, because it requires the vulnerability to let go of the comforting lifetime certainty that the predetermined path gives you: 2025 summer recruiting, analyst, associate \u2026 Well, the desire to eliminate uncertainty eliminates life. What do you plan to do after \u201csome years of experience\u201d with your future free time and why on earth are you not doing it now?\nIn his book \u201cExcellent Sheep,\u201d Deresiewicz advocates for the importance of time off, slowing down, breaking the cycle of endless achievement, and acknowledging the existence of a world outside of your Ivy League.

Yes, it was founded for them, but Penn\u2019s core mission today is the pursuit, enhancement, and dissemination of knowledge. We need to be aware of and manage our bewitching instinct to desire control and the social need for status. The truth is you cannot eradicate control and prestige. Just stop watering them. Like the French say, \u201cl\u00e2cher prise.\u201d\nLiberal education puts everything at risk and requires you to risk everything.

          "article_content": "Columnist Mariana Martinez describes her personal experiences with Penn's dining services.A text from my friend lit up my phone.\u00a0\n\u201cDude, you\u2019re literally getting the reverse Freshman 15!\u201d\n\t\t\u201cThe what?\u201d I replied.\nAs an international student, I had no idea that Freshman 15 was a thing. But by the time I found out what it was, it was already too late. My eating schedule became very irregular: I skipped meals thinking it was more practical for me. Because of Penn\u2019s poor dining services and few inclusive food options, my physical and mental health were severely affected by the end of my first semester.\u00a0\n\t\t\t\t\ufeffBefore coming to Penn, when people asked me what I would miss most from Colombia, I usually answered by saying I'd miss the food. But as my first semester flew by, I realized it went beyond missing my country\u2019s food and more into an overwhelming transition and violent adjustment to the American diet, characterized by fast-food consumption, takeout over-reliance, and a lack of fresh food. It made my transition to college even more overwhelming than it already was.\u00a0\nI never expected diet to pose the challenge it did during my first semester. I didn\u2019t expect my food options to narrow so suddenly. The differences between the American and other countries\u2019 diets cause international students to mess up their meal structure. In the midst of the American diet, breakfast becomes the least important meal, meal times become arbitrary, and late dinners are frequent.\u00a0\n\tI found myself skipping breakfast because I couldn\u2019t tolerate American breakfast foods: bacon, potatoes, sausage, casseroles. I stopped eating fruit, and I started eating only one large meal a day. At the same time, I was pushing myself to be my best in my classes, clubs, and job while running on very little fuel. By winter break, my body was pretty much destroyed.\nAs I asked other international students about their dining habits, I found that my experience was not an isolated one. Some of them told me that they \u201cjust don\u2019t know what to eat anymore.\u201d Others said that because of their international status, they had a limited budget to eat off-campus and that relying on Penn\u2019s terrible food was torturous.\u00a0\nSurveys have shown that as international students transition into their lives at American universities, many face dietary challenges and health consequences. For instance, many international students report a halt in their fruit and vegetable consumption because they believe the United States\u2019 options are not as fresh. Others report severe weight loss/gain and stomach issues from struggling to adapt to an American diet that consists mainly of meals large in sugars and fat.\u00a0\nBack in Colombia, I was used to having almost five meals a day. My diet included cereals and a variety of meats, vegetables, and fruits. Other international students also report being accustomed to multi-course meals, often characterized by a careful, homemade preparation. On the other hand, the American diet narrows down choices abruptly. International students describe their choices as pizza, salad, pasta, French fries, sandwiches, and chicken \u2014 which holds true to the quintessential Penn dining experience.\u00a0\n\t\tGet our newsletter, DP Daybreak, delivered to your inbox every weekday morning.Being thrown into a poor dietary environment has a significant impact on students\u2019 mental health. Many studies show that students with poor dietary conditions are more likely to suffer from depression and anxiety. The dietary conditions at Penn have impacted my emotional well-being: It is very frustrating to feel like I have no high-quality dining options. The strain on my wallet as I buy groceries and off-campus food is also stressful, considering around a third of Penn\u2019s international students are on financial aid.\u00a0\nThe international student experience with the food at Penn can only be described as aggravating. Not only is the American diet more unhealthy than food in international students\u2019 countries, but it also causes disruptions in meal structure and health. As a school that prides itself on being diverse, Penn should really focus on making the dining experience more accessible for its international students. Not to mention an improvement in the food would benefit the whole student body, given recent events. It is clear that this becomes a matter beyond just food: it\u2019s also about inclusivity, general well-being, and enjoying the college experience.\u00a0\nMARIANA MARTINEZ is a College first year studying English and classics from Bogot\u00e1, Colombia.

          "title": "Chapin Lenthall-Cleary | The Penn administration farcically mistreats new student clubs",
          "article_content": "Guest Columnist Chapin Lenthall-Cleary highlights the bureaucratic hurdles that face student organizations and clubs at Penn.It's no secret that many of the University's student clubs are brutally exclusive \u2014 often demanding prospective members submit applications and participate in interviews \u2014 only to bar most of them from participating anyway. It's no secret that this system of club exclusivity inflicts a variety of harms on students: It deprives them of opportunities to participate in academic, service, recreational, and other activities. It shuts them out of a significant avenue of making friends. It pits students against each other. It furthers a culture obsessed with credentials over learning (or whatever a club's mission might be). And, as if all of that weren't damaging enough, it wastes non-trivial amounts of students' limited time at the University.\u00a0\nIt's far less well known, however, that the University's administration \u2014 especially the Office of Student Affairs \u2014 imposes numerous stringent, farcical, and sometimes nearly insurmountable hurdles upon new, often open-membership clubs.\u00a0\n\t\tIn October 2022, I founded Penn Humans vs. Zombies (HvZ), a (then-unofficial) club that held live-action zombie apocalypse games with Nerf blasters in David Rittenhouse Laboratory. The games were open to everyone and attracted a range of undergraduates across various schools, plus graduate students, alumni, a few students from nearby schools, and occasionally a professor. We required no applications or interviews, even for club leadership positions, which were filled by those willing to do the extra work to help run the games. Against even the advice of some club officers, I refused to charge admission.\u00a0\nI don't want to oversell this: Lance or not, I wasn't killing any windmills. One silly game with an earnest mission, of course, wasn't fixing a broken system, nor was HvZ the only open-membership club at Penn. But HvZ was at least one example of something the University desperately needs and badly, though not completely, lacks places for Penn students to find community and friends with shared interests, free from demands to run a marathon in a rat race just for a chance at being let in the gate. In fact, my uncompromisingly open-membership policies are exactly what even OSA claims to want.\n\t\t\t\tSEE MORE FROM \ufeffOPINION:\ufeffEmily Chang | No Senator, not all Asians are ChineseKiyah Akins | How I have been shaped by Black historyAbout a year passed before I realized that our zombies weren\u2019t the most soulless people HvZ would have to face. Last fall, after hearing about HvZ, the building manager contacted me, demanded that I stop the games, and revoked my 24/7 access to DRL. I reluctantly agreed to stop holding the games in DRL, but I reached out to the director of OSA to appeal the decision, where I was met with a tsunami of bureaucracy and an instruction to stop the games until they gave approval. The process involved meetings between multiple members of OSA, public safety, risk management, and others. When I asked to be involved in these discussions, I received the canned reply, \"[OSA has] not traditionally included students at this stage of conversation.\"\u00a0\nIt took over a month to get permission from OSA to continue the games and about as long to sort out the actual process of getting a space. There was just one problem: OSA's Kafka-and-friends committee decided that HvZ had to occur in an athletic space. When I tried to rent such a space, I discovered that doing so would cost $75 an hour, or around $4,500 per semester for a four-hour game once a week, an impossible cost for our club. When I told the OSA director that having to pay this fee to continue our game would be as good as a death sentence for HvZ and asked for the fee to be waived or paid, I was told to go find funding. I'll say that again: We spent months waiting, only to be told that we needed to find a way to get the University to pay us thousands of dollars \u2014 that we'd use to pay Penn the fee they decided to charge us \u2014 to play a game that costs them nothing.\n\tI did everything the OSA director suggested and more to try to get funding. As it currently stands, we have only a small fraction of what we actually need. And, I'm not hopeful, because this isn't the first time I've tried to get funding for a club.\u00a0\nLast winter, I founded Drone Club, another open-membership club. This one was dedicated to building drones, and I was willing to teach less experienced students the electronics, soldering, physics, and skills involved in doing so. Initially, I paid largely out-of-pocket for parts, but this wasn't ideal or particularly sustainable, so I sought club funding. With significant effort and about a month's delay, we got $220, about half of what we requested, from the Common Funding Application, the very funding source the OSA director suggested we use to find thousands of dollars for HvZ. In fall 2023, in order to secure larger, more regular funding, I applied for SAC recognition, the primary avenue for regular club funding, for Drone Club.\u00a0\nDrone Club was rejected for the sole reason of not having been on the PennClubs website since Oct. 31, 2022 (yes, that\u2019s over a year before we applied, and it\u2019s different from the deadline listed on the SAC website). The stated reason for the requirement that inspired that rejection is that \"student groups must be sustainable,\" which requiring students to check a box a year in advance obviously does little to confirm. Indeed, as I noted in Drone Club's application, where I asked SAC \"not to reject us upon a technicality, and instead judge us upon our merits,\" Drone Club's mostly underclassman membership is an infinitely better metric for sustainability.\u00a0\nEven clubs that are accepted still aren't written into the SAC budget until the school year after applying. Combined together, these requirements mean that, even if nothing goes wrong, a new club takes years to receive SAC budget funding. Under the current system, a sophomore who started a club now would graduate before having a chance at seeing any SAC budget funding.\u00a0\nThe above is only a small fraction of the examples of Penn institutions' hostility towards new clubs: being denied tables at the activity fair, having Drone Club removed from the PennClubs website for not getting Engineering Student Activities Council recognition (which, according to the PennClubs website, isn't a requirement), and more. If you're shocked by the severity and regularity of this problem, keep in mind that these are only examples of the University's administration\u2019s hostility towards new, open-membership clubs that I run (and therefore know about), which are doubtlessly a tiny subset of the full problem.\u00a0\n\t\tGet our newsletter, DP Daybreak, delivered to your inbox every weekday morning.Despite this relentless onslaught, I still don't know how this story ends. There's still a scenario where a powerful administrator decides to put the welfare of students above rules and diktats, and says, \"Enough of this nonsense,\" and HvZ gets to return triumphantly to DRL, or at least to another good location, free from extortionate fees. There's still a scenario where Drone Club secures its funding for parts, and the many other clubs doubtlessly facing similar farcical obstacles are instead met with a well-lit road, not numerous Harnwell-and-a-half-high hurdles. Heck, there's still a scenario where OSA lives up to its stated ideals and starts staunchly supporting open-membership clubs and exerting real force to get closed-membership clubs to open up.\u00a0\nThis hasn't been a happy story, and I'm frankly not betting on that changing. Nor, sadly, would a single exception for HvZ solve this massive harm to students, thrilled though I\u2019d be to get such an exception. But this story isn\u2019t over yet. If enough people, or even one person with enough power, decide to end this farce today and decide that doing right by students must always come first, there could yet be not only a happy ending to HvZ's struggle but also a bright future for all open-membership clubs at the University. To the administrators who\u2019ve caused this damage and to those who have the power to fix it, shape up.\nCHAPIN LENTHALL-CLEARY is a College senior studying physics and philosophy from Radnor, Pa.

          "article_content": "This semester, I somehow ended up with four out of my five classes being either directly or indirectly about ethics. As a political science major, I was really excited to take these classes, since whenever people talk about ethics nowadays, it mostly has to do with politics or international relations.\nAt a time when our reality changes so rapidly because of technology, and when we are faced with a number of global challenges, some people have forgotten about the importance of acting morally. Especially at a place like Penn, where everyone seems to be extremely worried about their future and their careers, people often disregard these values when they are caught up by the competitive environment. Because of this, one would think that ethics classes would be extremely beneficial for all, but do they actually contribute to making students more ethical individuals?\n\t\tAccording to my professors, they don\u2019t.\nIn all four ethics classes, my professors started the semester by telling us that ethics classes will not make most of us more ethical. I sat there, listening to all of them, and I just could not understand why they would say something like that. If I wasn\u2019t going to learn anything, what was the point of taking these classes?\n\t\t\t\tSEE MORE FROM ZARA TENA:The urgent need for younger voices in politics\ufeffIt\u2019s okay to be ordinaryThat\u2019s where I was wrong: I have been learning a lot. While perhaps the main goal of ethics classes is not to turn students into more ethical people, they definitely give us the tools we need to critically engage with ethical dilemmas. By taking these classes, I might not become a better person, but they have given me a space where I can explore, discuss, and reflect about where I stand on so many issues and what my beliefs about morality actually are.\nEthics is not a subject that can be forcefully taught through lectures and readings. There is no way that we can sit down for three hours every week and magically become more ethical just because we memorize theories and read long papers written by old white men. The goal of these classes is not to tell us what is \u2018right\u2019 or \u2018wrong,\u2019 \u00a0but to give us the skills to navigate the gray areas in ethical decision making.\n\tThese classes encourage self reflection and personal growth. Even when analyzing big case studies or exploring different theories, students are pushed to question their own values, beliefs, and biases. While this may not guarantee that we will completely transform our moral compasses, the self awareness that comes from these reflections creates a great foundation for understanding why we act the way we do and also invites us to try to understand others.\nThe fact that ethics classes begin with a warning \u2014 that you won\u2019t become more ethical by taking them \u2014 should not stop anyone from giving them a chance. The ability to think critically, understand different values and perspectives, and have the skills to self reflect are essential parts of any college education. They prepare students for the complicated moral dilemmas they might face in their personal and professional lives \u2014 especially when most people at Penn will end up with jobs that are notorious for their ethical scandals!\nZARA TENA is a College sophomore studying political science from Puebla, Mexico.

          "article_content": "How many times have you found yourself in a never-ending cycle of back-and-forth messages, trying to pin down a date for a long overdue catch up with a friend? Every get together begins to feel as if it requires intricate planning and strips away the simplicity of social connection. This routine becomes stifling, lacking spontaneity and authenticity; you\u2019re constrained to coordinating with the same faces in the same places.\u00a0\nThis is what I like to call scheduling fatigue.\u00a0\n\t\tAs a result of this phenomenon, gatherings among friends are beginning to resemble scheduled business meetings, meticulously arranged via tools like When2Meet or synchronized Google Calendars.\nWhile resorting to scheduling may seem like the only viable option to maintain a semblance of social connection, perhaps it's time to embrace the idea of venturing out solo: I\u2019m challenging you to go on an unplanned side quest all by yourself to a third place.\u00a0\n\t\t\t\tMORE FROM LALA MUSTAFA:A nation on defense: Dismantling misinformation against Azerbaijan in the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict\ufeff\ufeffAllow me to explain. Picture the first place as your home and the second as your place of education or work. Now, the third place emerges as a public sphere where individuals congregate, not out of any obligation like in the previously mentioned locations, but, for lack of a more precise term, to simply vibe. It could be the cozy corner of a cafe, a communal park, or even the neighborhood barbershop \u2014 anywhere that\u2019ll allow you to interact with people outside your usual circles.\u00a0\nYet, at many universities like Penn, the concept of a third place seems all but lost as our lives remain restricted to school grounds, causing even our first and second places to converge into one. While spots on campus \u2014 like Stommons, Pret, or the cultural centers in ARCH \u2014 can offer some respite, they often come with the latent pressure of being on the clock. Conversations here revolve around assignments, internships, and the intricacies of Penn culture. The chances of an unexpected encounter dwindle given that most people in attendance will be other Penn students. As we\u2019re cocooned in the Penn bubble, it comes as no surprise that many students spend their four years in Philadelphia without ever fully exploring it.\u00a0\n\tYet, this insulation comes at a cost that extends far beyond what we realize.\u00a0\nIt severs our connection not only from the outside world but also from ourselves. That is, within such limits, our individuality dwindles, reducing us to mere roles influenced by our peers. By excluding ourselves from a wider social sphere, we inhibit opportunities to engage with diverse perspectives, trap ourselves in a cycle of familiarity, and risk leading monotonous lives that pave the way to burnout.\nHowever, in our lives, both intimacy and affiliation with broader communities are essential. While intimacy often stems from our immediate circles, affiliation thrives in third places where spontaneous interactions occur. These spaces facilitate easy contact with new individuals on a regular basis, without the need for prior scheduling. As they consistently offer an opportunity for interaction with others, they end up cultivating the most reliable form of socialization.\u00a0\nSo, if you are keen on exploring new horizons and getting involved in the Philadelphia community, I suggest checking out the many informative articles dedicated to bursting the Penn bubble.\nNevertheless, I want to avoid confining third places to physical locations. They\u2019re more of a mindset, a willingness to embrace spontaneity wherever it may arise. They don't have to be far from campus or require spending money. Instead, third places can be any informal spots you visit \u2014 whether it's your student lounge, the library, or a community center.\u00a0\n\t\tGet our newsletter, DP Daybreak, delivered to your inbox every weekday morning.We often find ourselves caught up in the routines of daily life, clinging to familiar patterns of scheduling and social interaction.

          "title": "Beatriz B\u00e1ez | No closed captioning available",
          "article_content": "Columnist Beatriz B\u00e1ez explains her experience with language fatigue at Penn.On my first day at Penn, I called my father in distress, telling him I needed to move back home and study there as I was going to die alone at this university. My father asked why, and I quickly responded, \u201cI haven\u2019t met anybody in three hours. I have no friends. It\u2019s over for me.\u201d\u00a0\nThat very same night, I went to a New Student Orientation event at Houston Hall. As I nervously paced the floor in my Crocs, I overheard some students speaking Spanish and immediately gravitated toward them. Confessing, \u201cI heard Spanish, and I feel saved,\u201d I ended up meeting three genuine individuals, all from various parts of Latin America. Having arrived in the United States, it felt comforting to hear voices that reminded me of home. This comfort is priceless in such a foreign environment.\n\t\tAll my life, I\u2019ve taken courses in Spanish, spoken Spanish at home, and been berated by my grandmother whenever I spoke too much English. Arriving at Penn, I didn\u2019t anticipate the struggle I would face taking classes taught in English, as I had been lucky enough to have been extensively taught English from a very young age.\nBut speaking in a second language most of the time, even as a fluent speaker, is incredibly draining. Meeting native Spanish speakers at Penn was truly a blessing. However, I have found that some people react adversely to me speaking my primary language. These are not continuous reactions of a high degree, but there have been enough small instances to mark me.\u00a0\n\t\t\t\tMORE ON THIS TOPIC:Students celebrate 40th annual Festival Latinx, honoring Latinx culture on campusLa Casa Latina celebrates 2023 Latinx Heritage Month at PennOn various occasions, I have had Latinx friends say, \u201cLet\u2019s speak English so X person doesn\u2019t feel excluded,\u201d or even resort to English for \u201cconvenience\u201d when we\u2019re alone. For the former, I understand the sentiment. I wouldn\u2019t want someone to be excluded from a conversation in such a way. However, when I\u2019m naturally speaking Spanish, having my speech interpreted as a personal offense is off-putting.\u00a0\nIn one instance, I met a student through a mutual friend on a night out. This friend and I speak fluent Spanish; the person I had just met did not. Throughout the night, I had various conversations with my new acquaintance \u2014 who I found quite amicable \u2014 and my friend. I would naturally speak Spanish with the latter, not thinking much of it. The next morning, my friend told me how the new acquaintance felt I hated them for speaking Spanish in front of them, knowing they didn\u2019t speak the language.\u00a0\n\tI was shocked by the assumption and, in all honesty, a little offended. I found it quite conceited that one would think another person is speaking in their first language to actively exclude them. Speaking in a first language, for me, is purely a relief issue. Although I am fluent in English, after an entire week of speaking it, it can be extremely draining; thus, particularly in a social setting, I don\u2019t want to add to the exhaustion.\u00a0\nIt is more than fine to be curious about what somebody is saying and ask for a translation. However, immediately expressing discomfort upon hearing another language and presuming the other person is talking badly about you is inconsiderate toward them. More often than not, this language switch is for comfort. This was the first of sufficient instances that exposed a pattern in my time at Penn. In another class, I grew close to a few other Spanish-speaking students. One of them continuously suggested we switch back to English for seemingly no valid reason and would reply to any comment of mine in English.\u00a0\nThis harsh reality on campus expands into the club scene. In one instance, a native English speaker attended a club meeting primarily led in Spanish. Within this meeting, if club members asked questions in Spanish, any other members who answered quickly switched to English. Evidently, the intent is to have everybody be able to partake in conversation. However, members within a Spanish-led group should be able to detach from English formalities within club meetings, particularly if the club seeks to embrace Latinx heritage.\u00a0\nSpeaking in my primary language is the greatest manifestation of my culture, particularly since Spanish accents are so diverse throughout Latin America. Having to switch to English not only in academic settings but in seemingly every other sphere of Penn life further disconnects me from the culture I\u2019ve been surrounded by my entire life until now. This applies to any person whose main language isn\u2019t English, not only to Spanish speakers.\u00a0\n\t\tGet our newsletter, DP Daybreak, delivered to your inbox every weekday morning.Penn has students from over 100 countries, with around 19% of the student body being international. If one truly wants to immerse themselves in Penn\u2019s multilingual community, one needs to recognize that a language barrier works both ways. Just as an English speaker may be tired from learning another language, a non-English speaker can be drained from constantly speaking English. It\u2019s crucial to recognize that for the latter, multilingualism surpasses a simple language requirement and spills over to nearly every sector of their life at Penn.\u00a0\nLanguage fatigue is a true reality, especially for individuals who haven\u2019t learned English from a young age. Thus, if somebody within your social group is speaking their first language, which you are not fluent in, it does not give you the right to feel offended or urge them to speak in a tongue you understand. And, if you are a non-native English speaker, as much as you can, \"habla en tu primer idioma y que los dem\u00e1s se ubiquen.\"\nBEATRIZ B\u00c1EZ is a College first year studying mathematics and political science from San Juan, Puerto Rico.

In our instruction at the University of Pennsylvania, we were told to reach for safety and to secure our decadence.

We were never meant to become the fools and tools of the mythic America: the one that is superior, war-hungry, greedy, and hypocritical. These choices did their damage. That was an aberration. Now, we are entering a time of correction.\u00a0\n\tWe want to know the meaning of our lives when we live in a country whose hand assassinates a man and poet as beautiful and courageous as Refaat Alareer, when we live in a society in which Aaron Bushnell had to die so that humanity could live. When the youngest students of Philadelphia stand to say they are no different from the children of Palestine, that the bombs dropped abroad also explode in our neighborhoods, we then know it is true for ourselves \u2014 that we bleed the same as these children in Palestine, as all the men and women we encounter in Philadelphia.\u00a0\nOur bondage to the genocide in Gaza is through the struggle to become moral human beings in America, and to relinquish our country from the myths that strangle us and our people.\u00a0\nIt is unmistakable that the education Penn offers is bankrupt, and that some cancer, invisible but detectable, poisons our relationships to each other and to ourselves. The scramble for acceptance into mediocre clubs and fraternities is insufferable, and the false authority these groups stand on in order to make these judgments is embarrassing. Within this sea and storm of immoral standards, the truth and our touchstone live in the broader historic moment \u2014 the crisis we know and the possibilities we see.\u00a0\n\t\tGet our newsletter, DP Daybreak, delivered to your inbox every weekday morning.The real task of Penn students is the same as it always has been: to be present in their lives, in this city, to examine and test the assumptions they have inherited, to develop a coherent worldview that explains the reality before them. To investigate and challenge the standards of their education, peers, and professors. And to then act and live by these new definitions, through which we will discover freedom. The world makes us, and we make it, too.\u00a0\nIf we were meant to become the leaders of this country and makers of history, as so many of us have been told from youth into maturity \u2014 that we are capable of this \u2014 then this is our role to fulfill: a brave, original, and purposeful life that skirts the frontier of new standards for this nation.

          "title": "Hanadi Abdulkadir | How poor dining hall food shapes our mental and academic capabilities",
          "article_content": "At this point, many Penn students have lived the terrible dining stories at a number of halls across campus. While it\u2019s important to discuss the health and sanitary risks associated with some of these concerns, it\u2019s also necessary to break down how this problem factors into students\u2019 academic and mental well-being.\u00a0\nOpening Sidechat every few days to see yet another picture of undercooked meat or hearing horror stories from my friends dissuades me from trekking across campus to eat at many of our dining halls. Oftentimes, I find myself skipping meals or stretching the time out between each one \u2014 until I accept the fact that I\u2019ll be eating the same food I already ate a couple times that week. Does this mean that I\u2019m probably missing out on some of the necessary vitamins or fiber I should be getting daily? Probably.\n\t\tNumerous Penn Dining Wellness emails live in our inboxes with tips on improving digestive health and practicing better healthy habits in our daily lives. Additionally, the official page for Penn Dining boasts awards and recognitions for sustainability and top college dining. However, the pristine and glossy promotional pictures of sandwiches, smoothies, and breakfast bowls tell a completely different story from the reality on campus.\nWith two of the most historical repeat offenders \u2014 Hill House and 1920 Commons \u2014 being the only consistent options available for on campus dining during the weekend, it\u2019s much more convenient to resort to the other retail spots scattered around campus. However, some of these locations are far apart, depending on where you live, and can add additional costs to weekly expenses. \u00a0\n\t\t\t\tSEE MORE FROM HANADI ABDULKADIR:\ufeffPenn should require an African American history courseWhy social media and Palestinian activism goes hand in handAdditionally, for students who are dishing out a hefty sum of money to enroll in the dining plan, going out of their way to seek expensive alternatives takes away money that could\u2019ve been better spent elsewhere. Considering that first years and sophomores are required to pick a dining plan for their first two years at Penn, it\u2019s no wonder that students have consistently called for the food standards to match the high prices of these meal swipes. Ideally, no student should feel like they need to resort to options outside of Penn; rather, outside options should be supplemental to an already quality level of options at all dining halls.\u00a0\nSince coming to Penn, my relationship with food has become much more complex. I need to look twice when picking out a seemingly clean utensil to eat whatever is on my plate or stare extra hard at my salad with suspicion before consuming it. But growing up, food was always a way for me to connect with my family and friends, to bring us back together even when we hadn\u2019t seen each other in a long time. Yet the food at Penn, at its worst, has left me frustrated and succeeded at suppressing my appetite \u2014 something I actually can relate to other students about.\n\tAlthough certain foods are scientifically linked to improving mental clarity and focus, I hesitate in reaching for those vegetables because they don\u2019t look as fresh or appetizing when lined up on display in Kings Court English House. As a result, I look for short-term solutions in coffee, which leaves me feeling tired earlier in the day or exhausted while trying to tackle my assignments at night. In order to meet my immediate deadlines, I prioritize some assignments over others, meaning some classes suffer in academic performance and perpetuate an almost never-ending cycle of playing catch-up. I believe that the root cause of all these problems can be traced back to the lack of decent dining.\u00a0\nThis same sentiment has been echoed by many of my friends and peers. But the dining quality at Penn can be mitigated if the University addresses the root problem. Whether that be promoting clean and sanitary workspaces when handling food or streamlining student complaints to Penn Dining other than through email, the University can restore student faith in the system. When it comes to campus dining, Penn can improve upon our experiences by implementing the changes that students deserve to enjoy, especially at the height of midterm season.\nHANADI ABDULKADIR is a College sophomore studying international relations from Philadelphia.

          "article_content": "During Penn\u2019s recent administrative upheaval, the University community found an unexpected silver lining: For the first time, Penn was making headlines alongside Harvard and MIT.\u00a0\nThe presidents of these three institutions were at the center of an infamous congressional hearing in December after their alleged missteps on campus antisemitism. I\u2019ll admit, there is something far more distasteful about chaos at the Capitol than the collective HYPSM prestige.\n\t\tBut many of us are taking our education at Penn for granted, shedding our \u201cque ser\u00e1, ser\u00e1\u201d optimism, and wondering at times what it would be like to go to a more recognizable Ivy. For decades, we\u2019ve all but exhausted our morale by clarifying to passersby that no, Penn State and Penn are not the same university. And yes, Penn is actually active in areas outside of Wharton\u2019s finance programs.\nSo, when Penn Engineering announced its new undergraduate program in artificial intelligence, many of us were enthusiastic about the University\u2019s growing role in the innovation sector: a space thought to be dominated by less business-oriented institutions.\n\t\t\t\tSEE MORE FROM MRITIKA SENTHIL: Removing legacy admissions will align Penn\u2019s actions more closely with its educational missionWhy changing leadership won\u2019t eliminate antisemitism at PennBut Penn\u2019s realization, of possibly its most practical initiative, begs the question: Is the University actually necessary in DevOps? Does sitting in a classroom \u2014 let alone one that\u2019s in the midst of a campus known for its influx of finance bros \u2014 really supersede what can be MacGyvered by a tech junkie with only a laptop, caffeine, and time? I want to give a definite \u201cno.\u201d Otherwise, I would need to hold my classmates and myself accountable for upholding all the exclusivity that comes with attending Penn. And yet, there are a frustrating number of anonymous netizens, D-list journalists, and LinkedIn bards who call Ivy League universities like Penn \u201cout of touch\u201d \u2014 remnants of centuries-old American elitism in an era of bottom-up grassroots movements.\nOne C-suite executive anticipates that \u201cthe best AI engineers and builders won\u2019t graduate Penn Engineering. They'll be global, builders and in the right group chats.\u201d His readers agree, with one commenter further emphasizing that \u201cuniversities cannot keep up with the pace of free market innovation.\u201d When these schools attempt to go against the grain and align with consumer needs, \u201cit genuinely looks embarrassing and out of date.\u201d\n\tIn an environment where the use of AI models is largely democratized, we\u2019re naturally drawn to the trope of a layperson who forgoes bureaucratic systems to channel their intelligence: creating life-changing inventions that would have never come to be under self-serving corporate and political influences. And when ignoring cases of succor \u2014 as mainstream media unfortunately does \u2014 there are many examples of such successes. Bill Gates and Paul Allen, co-founders of Microsoft, were university dropouts. So were Meta Platforms co-founders Mark Zuckerberg and Dustin Moskovitz. As Penn\u2019s over reliance on donors came to light earlier this school year, critics of the upper crust have continued to group Penn with other perpetrators of social stratification. The field of AI is, by nature, continuously evolving. And limiting growth in the discipline to those who can afford, and then succeed in Penn\u2019s Department of Computer and Information Science courses is counterproductive.\nHowever, these narratives misrepresent the intentions of Penn\u2019s AI program.\nTo make a better case for Penn\u2019s AI major, I spoke with Robert Ghrist, Andrea Mitchell Professor and associate dean for undergraduate education at Penn Engineering. He describes how the process of integrating AI in education is similar to the effects of increasing access to music recording and playback technologies. Now, there is \u201cmore music for everyone at much lower prices,\u201d he told me. Nonetheless, \u201cartists at the very top of the industry\u201d are increasingly the benefactors of \u201ca concentration of rewards.\u201d Taylor Swift is, as any current news feed can attest to, perhaps the most prolific embodiment of such phenomena. And professor Ghrist strives to make Penn an incubator of sorts for the \u201cTaylor Swifts of AI\u201d that seek avenues for academic growth, to actually be the \u201cleading edge where the best thrive.\u201d\nAnd to thrive in this discipline, aspiring AI mavens are off course by simply memorizing browser instructions in JavaScript and praying for a tech equivalent of the coveted Goldman Sachs internship. After all, studying AI is a philosophical pursuit: an inquiry into the nature of consciousness and ethics of creating sentient machines. It\u2019s also a political pursuit, for AI poses challenges in regulatory compliance. There are countless possible liabilities for even the most basic ChatGPT input, such as unprotected user data and violations of intellectual property rights. \u00a0\n\t\tGet our newsletter, DP Daybreak, delivered to your inbox every weekday morning.Needless to say, as you might have noticed in my earlier columns, I am not an AI major. I\u2019m not even enrolled in Penn Engineering. Am I, of all students, in the right to quash critics of the Penn AI major when I dropped AP Computer Science in high school (with no regrets)?\nYet, it\u2019s clearly irresponsible to follow the well-intentioned advice from tech capitalists when constant innovation is not particularly ideal for society. Maybe I\u2019m just afraid of a \"Black Mirror\"-esque dystopia, but there is a kind of ominous quality to the idea of highly skilled AI scientists off the reins. Penn, however, is cultivating an ecosystem that nurtures AI talent, albeit not by stifling the next Elon Musk or Sam Altman with red-tape-ridden academics; instead, Penn fosters ethically conscious innovation that addresses complex societal challenges. And so, the fact that I can engage with the Penn curricula across departments has a surprising beauty. The opportunity to become a part of this technological movement \u2014 or, dare I say, revolution \u2014 is the gift of studying AI at Penn.\nMRITIKA SENTHIL is a first year studying management and Russian and east European studies from Columbia, S.C.

          "title": "Akiva Berkowitz | An AI major by any other name ",
          "article_content": "Artificial intelligence is a topic we can\u2019t seem to get enough of. From frequent announcements regarding policies within classrooms to endless professors and visiting scholars weighing in on the unprecedented effect large language models will have on our lives, I\u2019m sure we\u2019ve all discussed to death how revolutionary ChatGPT has become for college students.\u00a0\nMany of us have even had the chance to firmly establish positions on whether the University should embrace the technology wholeheartedly or put in place safeguards to prevent it from eroding the value of a college education, but up until now, the vast majority of conversations have been on a non-technical level.\n\t\tThat all potentially changed in this past month when Penn announced their first Bachelor of Science in Engineering in AI. Thankfully for us, Penn has chosen to launch this interdisciplinary degree at the \u201coptimal time\u201d to \u201ccreate a society where AI isn\u2019t just a tool, but a fundamental force for good to advance society.\u201d But at what cost? To what extent should we be using college as an opportunity to hyperfocus on not just a certain field (computer science), but a field within a field? Majoring in AI panders to the pre-professionalism Penn is known for and removes many of the foundational elements of the field that underlie innovation.\u00a0\nIn an interesting recent LinkedIn post, David Magerman pondered the implications of a university building complete undergraduate curriculums around a \u201cmodern business tool that is a niche application of computer science, diverting students away from a broad education in computer science.\u201d He went on to ask pointedly, \u201cWhat's next? A Bachelor of Arts in Blogging from the Annenberg School? A Wharton BS in Quantitative Trading?\u201d\n\t\t\t\tSEE MORE FROM AKIVA BERKOWITZ:The newsletter is dead\ufeffIsrael under attack: What do you stand for?As a current computer science major, I\u2019ll admit the AI curriculum looks fascinating. There is such an array of eye-catching electives (from Deep Generative Models to Natural Language Processing) that, if I were doing my degree all over again, I suspect I would have been swayed to switch into the major. But as a recently graduated computer and information science friend put it, the degree \u201cseems like the cool parts of CIS\u201d without the heavier basics like operating systems, computer systems, and physics \u2014 building blocks on the entire computer domain. \u00a0\nThe question I ask myself is whether artificial intelligence is really enough of an independent field that it transcends computer science and necessitates its own major. Is the relatively new field of AI established enough, broad enough, and unique enough such that the skills we gain through taking just those mostly career-focused courses today will undoubtedly remain relevant in 30 years and justify the $84,600 a year sticker price? I simply wonder how likely it may be that AI will become so unrecognizable in 20 or even 10 years, given its breakneck pace of innovation, that students may have wished that their majors in college focused on more fundamental elements of the field that innovators keep turning back to for insight.\u00a0\n\tAside from long-term career effectiveness an AI degree would have compared to computer science or electrical engineering, Penn is known for its pre-professional student body, and this new major shows signs of that sentiment leaking into the curriculum as well. In contrast to the Penn Integrates Knowledge professorships that bring in academic leaders who deeply understand multiple fields to better spark insight between them, this new major filters various courses of study to pluck out the elements we find valuable today.\u00a0\nIn this line of thinking, maybe we should consider the true value of a groundbreaking Wharton degree in quant trading that would promise to \u201csculpt the financial moguls of tomorrow\u201d with unparalleled prowess in algorithmic trading strategies and quantitative analysis.\u00a0\nAll this is to say, I immediately understand the value the current AI concentration within the larger CIS curriculum has. And I appreciate the Ph.D. programs that take students to a higher level of understanding, once they\u2019ve taken the time in their undergraduate training to build the broad foundations. I simply remain curious of the true value an AI undergraduate degree offers us as students over other forms of study within the field and the certain level of indulgence in pre-professionalism that it plays into on Penn\u2019s campus. I truly hope that I\u2019m proven wrong.\nAKIVA BERKOWITZ is an Engineering junior studying computer science from Silver Spring, Md.

          "article_content": "As busy college students, most of us do not have time to cook our own meals, and if you are anything like me, cooking is far from your forte. The hassle of having to go to the grocery store, cook, and clean can be time consuming and even more difficult when you\u2019re overwhelmed with classes, clubs, and homework. For the many students without access to a kitchen in their dorm, this presents an even bigger challenge. Luckily, college campuses have dining halls! Students simply swipe their card to get access to an all-you-care-to-eat dining experience. Dining halls provide easy access meals to students\u2014but what happens when that food is inedible?\nAs a picky eater, I know that simply because I do not like a dish does not mean it is unsafe to eat, but food with cockroaches and glass is unsafe for anyone. A seemingly obvious underlying assumption in dining is that food is safe to eat. College dining halls should be a place where students go to eat well-cooked, hairless, and insect-free food. However, that is not the case at Penn: There is a lack of responsibility to make sure the food is meeting basic standards for, let alone satisfying, all students.\u00a0\n\t\tMeal plans are far from cheap. For the sticker price, students would expect quality food, but they would be wrong. Both of the first-year student meal plan options cost $6,330, with the maximum amount of swipes being 296. Each meal swipe equates to roughly $17, which is about the same price as a Caniac Combo at Raising Cane's. As previously stated, Penn dining hall food is far from gourmet, and its price is too high for the quality delivered.\u00a0\nExpensive dining plan meals are not unique to Penn, but other Ivy League schools have similar prices for better quality food. Cornell University offers an unlimited meal plan, so students may visit the dining halls as much as they want with a fixed cost of $6,942 for food ranked second-best in the nation. So, for roughly 600 more dollars, Cornell students have access to unlimited meals and substantially better quality dining.\u00a0\n\t\t\t\tSEE MORE FROM ERIC NAJERA: \ufeffWe should be grateful to attend PennPenn clubs should have an assigned faculty member\ufeffAside from price and quality, weekend dining is another struggle. With the popular McClelland Sushi & Market and Houston Market being closed on Saturdays and the other dining halls closing at 8 p.m., food options are limited. Late-night study sessions means having to resort to local food places that remain open, and unlike nearby schools such as Drexel, our dining dollars do not work at off-campus restaurants and out-of-pocket money spent on takeout can add up quickly.\nBefore every school break, Sidechat is flooded with posts of excitement for home-cooked meals. In my classes, when asked what we are excited for, most students reply being able to eat good food. It is not uncommon for college students to miss their home-cooked meals, but when students are excited to actually eat food that is not served alongside insects, it signifies a problem.\n\tWith Penn\u2019s Bon App\u00e9tit contract still in place, we may not know how much Penn can do to change the dining experience. Safe, clean food should not be an unreasonable expectation. In order to enhance a student's experience outside the classroom, Penn must budget for an edible food experience for all students.\nERIC NAJERA is a College sophomore studying history from Rolling Meadows, Ill.

          "article_content": "We all know the typical \u201ctypes\u201d of high schoolers, the different clich\u00e9s: Where are my nerds at? But, another attribute of student groups that has become increasingly relevant in the 21st century United States is the diverse ethnic makeup of its population. And, frankly, do we as a campus mirror all that comes with that national trend of diversity?\nThink of the friends with whom you often hang out. Then, ask those friends with whom they usually go out. Finally, think of the groups you are a part of, the extracurriculars in which you partake. Notice a pattern?\n\t\t\u201c[D]espite increased opportunity to live and work in mixed-race settings, Americans remain racially segregated in their friendship patterns,\u201d a study published by the National Institutes of Health found. \u201cSpatial racism, cultural encapsulation, and personal choice are contributing factors for patterns of same-race friendships.\u201d\u00a0\nThis pattern seems to reflect the divisions present in Penn\u2019s social scene as well. Despite coming from all sorts of backgrounds across the world, the University\u2019s students appear to have unconsciously adopted a policy of self segregation. In other words, we like to \u201cstick to our own\u201d by socializing with others to whom we relate to on a cultural, ethnic, or religious basis. So, regardless of Penn\u2019s efforts to integrate people of differing experiences and beliefs, there still remains a degree of resistance by individuals themselves to cross those racial or cultural lines.\n\t\t\n\t\nAs a result, the potential for diversity of thought is threatened. A narrow mindset develops within these groups that students pledge to, and they effectively act as echo chambers that exacerbate already crippling political polarization. We relate to each other less, rely on our \u201cown\u201d more, and become less tolerant of the views, and thus experiences, of those who do not necessarily look, think, or speak like us.\nThis kind of thinking \u2014 whether manifested in the form of race, religion, or otherwise \u2014 has led to serious tension at times and enabled a distorted view of certain communities and how they experience Penn. I attribute part of that thinking not to the identity groups we are a part of, but to how much we value them over who we are as individuals.\n\tHomogenous communities definitely have their place in the college experience: They help ease our transition when we first arrive at Penn, and their role cannot be replaced. I say this as an international student myself, who had a hard time acclimating to an entirely different culture and, most radically, diet. Nonetheless, we should treat these organizations as an aid to finding belonging on campus, not a substitute for individual thought and expression.\nHowever, none of this means individuals can\u2019t agree or always need to separate themselves from the group. The use of a large, collective voice can benefit our campus much more than we realize. What is important to note is that there lies a clear distinction between acknowledging the views of others and forcing ourselves to accept those views for the sake of conformity.\nThere is nothing wrong with disagreeing with the majority, whether it is one against two or one against a nation (though some may try to tell you otherwise). As long as you are respectful and driven by a desire to learn rather than defend, there are no limits on what perspective you may question. So, challenge your beliefs, reevaluate your viewpoint, challenge that of others (no matter who they are), and then reevaluate yourself again. It\u2019ll be hard at first, to express your precise, genuine thoughts without fear. But, remember that you\u2019re not alone (I struggle sometimes myself) and that it\u2019s a process you won\u2019t always get right.\n\t\tGet our newsletter, DP Daybreak, delivered to your inbox every weekday morning.The hardest part of breaking out of groupthink, after realizing it, is talking about it. My advice? Take the plunge and never look back. The next time you are in a group and the majority agrees with an idea you don\u2019t like, let it be known. Talk about it and explain why you think the way you do. Don\u2019t worry if some get offended or others simply do not agree; it is normal and, in fact, expected.\u00a0\nNever forget that disputes you engage in are an opportunity, not a challenge, and our differences are enlightening, not threatening. Only then will we begin to understand and appreciate each other more as unique actors in a truly historic community.\nZAID ALSUBAIEI is a College first year studying economics from Al-Khobar, Saudi Arabia.

          "article_content": "I downloaded Sidechat this fall after my friends sent me too many screenshots of funny memes or jokes posted on the anonymous app. I figured that doing so would simply remove the middleman. I was already being exposed to the same jokes, memes, comments and judgements as those on the app anyway \u2026 right?\u00a0\nIn December, I returned home for reading days and fell into an easy pattern of studying. Nothing I did was wildly exciting or social, but I instead found myself enjoying the routine and satisfaction of productivity. During my study breaks, I would scroll on Sidechat \u2014 and from the comfort of my home, I felt myself spiraling into anxious dread about returning to Penn. Each time I opened the app, I was faced with a barrage of posts all echoing the same sentiment: Penn is awful and depressing. Without a second thought, I accepted those posts as fact, and in doing so, I allowed Sidechat to have more power than it deserves. In other words, I subscribed to the complaining culture that is pervasive on Sidechat.\u00a0\n\t\tUsing Sidechat, especially without intentional thought, is a way of looking at Penn through hypercritical glasses. Perhaps this is because negativity has been normalized and cynicism gets more upvotes. To some extent, this pessimistic messaging is diluted with the insertion of mildly entertaining memes or jokes, but the result is still the same. With each scroll, Sidechat is perpetuating a defeatist perspective of Penn.\u00a0\nSo, I arrived back at Penn to take my final exam: openly unhappy about returning to what I thought would be a bleak campus as a result of discourse on Sidechat. But to my surprise, it was not horrific, and I was able to enjoy my weekend of studying just as I had my week at home. The sheer volume of disheartening posts on Sidechat had clouded my perspective and ability to see the best in the situation. Sure, I was becoming one with a Huntsman GSR while others were at home enjoying break, but on the other hand, I was with my friends and able to have a sleepy campus all to myself.\n\t\t\t\tAs is the case with most other social media platforms, Sidechat is consumed passively and without a second thought \u2014 it\u2019s used to pass time, curb boredom, and satiate our addictions to our phones. And yet, students are absorbing and internalizing content more quickly than they can truly digest it.\u00a0\nGiven the bandwagon culture on Sidechat, users often build off of one another, creating a chaotic, and often dismal, echo chamber that does not truly represent life at Penn. Whether or not college is the best four years of your life, it is at least what you make of it, and Sidechat enables students to feel like victims of an unknown cause. For those who are actually struggling, Sidechat acts not as a productive outlet, but rather as a meta ether that provides no remedy other than the satisfaction that others are unhappy too.\u00a0\n\tSince winter break, I have in fact deleted Sidechat and am all the better for it. I still get sent the best and the brightest jokes by my friends, but I am no longer overwhelmed by unsolicited complaints on an hourly basis. Without Sidechat, my thoughts on the housing lottery, the floods in the Quad, and upcoming midterms are completely my own. Deleting Sidechat may not be for everyone, but it\u2019s imperative for those who chose to use Sidechat to take a more critical view of what is being circulated and evaluate whether or not they are benefiting from it. It may just change the way they see Penn.\u00a0\nELIZA CARROLL is a College first year studying international relations and art history from Greenwich, Conn.

As you walk through the brightly colored 40-foot paifang \u2014 known to most as Chinatown\u2019s Friendship Gate \u2014 you enter into a cultural oasis that has stood strong in the heart of Philadelphia for nearly 150 years. Beyond this fixture, Chinatown serves as a home to nearly 3,000 residents and numerous family-owned businesses, restaurants, shops, and community organizations. Whether you are going to Ken\u2019s Seafood Restaurant for a fun night out or Heng Fa for groceries, Chinatown feels like home.\u00a0\nUnfortunately, this community has been under constant attack for decades and is once again facing the threat of displacement and gentrification from a plan to develop an arena for the Philadelphia 76ers merely a block away. We firmly stand with the Students for the Preservation of Chinatown and urge you to do the same. \u00a0\n\t\tSince the early 1900s, Chinatown has been a victim of gentrification often driven by predatory infrastructure projects. In 1932, the construction of subway infrastructure at Ridge and Eighth streets \u2014 and the subsequent development of the Vine Street Expressway from 1957 to 1991 \u2014 resulted in the destruction of buildings and severe divisions within the community. Bringing in noise and pollution, the expressway eroded neighborhoods and people's quality of life. This was not Chinatown's sole battle, however, as it also faced multiple proposals of developments for a federal prison in 1992, a baseball stadium in 2000, and a casino in 2008.\u00a0\nThe story of Philadelphia's Chinatown mirrors other Chinatowns across the nation. Amid the 1994 fiscal crisis in Washington, D.C., then-Washington Wizards owner Abe Pollin negotiated a deal for the downtown Capital One Arena, where the city covered pre-development costs to acquire and demolish properties. Entrepreneurs in Washington's Chinatown voiced concerns about prices of real estate skyrocketing and parking impacts on businesses in the area. A decade later, most Chinese residents were forced to move out due to unaffordable housing. The parking shortage led to the closure of the last Chinese grocery store, accelerating the decline of the Chinese American population in the area to fewer than 400 residents today. Ironically, as D.C.\u2019s arena now relocates to the suburbs, the community is left behind, having endured irreversible destruction while in the midst of its recovery from the pandemic.\u00a0\n\t\t\t\tMORE FROM LIALA SOFI AND CATHY LI:Liala Sofi | The hypocrisy of billionaire philanthropistsCathy Li | Philadelphia\u2019s changing tastesIn New York\u2019s Chinatown, threats of displacement and economic insecurity also loom high. In 2021, the Museum of Chinese in America accepted a donation of $35 million in support of a borough-based jail complex which would displace Chinese American working-class people in the area. On top of that, its board executives were connected to the closing of the last unionized restaurant, beloved Jing Fong banquet hall, and construction of luxury towers that are actively raising rent and real estate taxes in the area.\nIn Philadelphia, the current 76Place project is being developed by 76 DevCo, an initiative by 76ers managing partners Josh Harris, David Blitzer, and David Adelman. Adelman is at the forefront of the construction of the arena and has promised not to displace the residents or businesses in Chinatown, but his past actions speak louder than his current words. Adelman works closely with Brett Altman, who also owns the University City Townhomes, and was a key figure behind the demolition and end of affordable housing in the West Philadelphia area that was previously known as the \"Black Bottom.\u201d This constant cycle of displacing residents and communities that have lived in the area for generations must end, and we must be the voice to make this happen.\n\tDevelopers of the project have stated that the arena will \u201cserve as a model for an equitable & inclusive community,\u201d yet there is not a single mention of Chinatown in the proposal. Efforts to ensure communities can benefit from this project read as empty promises when nearly 95% of residents, business owners, and visitors oppose the arena\u2019s construction.\nMany questions posed by residents have also gone unanswered by 76 DevCo. How will restaurants and small businesses in the surrounding area be protected? Who will clean the streets after huge events?\u00a0\nPreserving Philadelphia's architectural heritage demands careful consideration in urban development, but the development of the arena does the exact opposite \u2014 jeopardizing accessible low-income and senior housing complexes, healthcare clinics, and schools for children.\nPenn has direct ties to the developers in the area, and students should be cognizant of the situation. Adelman currently sits on Penn Medicine Board of Trustees and is the CEO of Campus Apartments, which houses many Penn students off-campus. But more importantly, Penn students are directly and indirectly involved in the Chinatown community, whether that be Penn Lions performing all throughout the city for Lunar New Year, or student groups like SPOC organizing initiatives to honor traditions celebrating the multi-ethnic communities that reside there.\u00a0\nDespite what greedy developers may suggest, Chinatown is not an ethnic theme park but a home. It\u2019s more than just a place to eat, it\u2019s a support network and a cultural hub for immigrants and visitors alike.\nIn the face of ongoing threats, Chinatown has demonstrated remarkable resilience and activism, advocating for the needs of all diverse communities of color that are integrated into the cultural fabric of our city. The next time you are in Chinatown, take a look around at all the place has to offer. Venture into Ebisu for some home decor and enjoy a Mochinut donut as you shop. Come by Dae Bak for soul-nourishing Korean barbecue. The opportunities to support your favorite restaurants and local businesses are endless.\nPlease don't turn a blind eye to what is happening outside the Penn bubble. Pay attention to what SPOC and other organizers are doing in the fight for the preservation of Chinatown. Educate yourself on what is going on in Chinatowns across the country. If you can, participate in programming like Crane Chinatown Community Center art exhibitions or Show Your Love for Chinatown events to learn more about the challenges facing the neighborhood. Sign petitions. \u00a0\nAdorned with dragon motifs, and gorgeous ornamental roof tiles, the Friendship Archway is not only an architectural masterpiece, but a labor of love \u2014\u00a0created for community by community. The engineers and artisans from Tianjin, China \u2014 Philadelphia\u2019s sister city \u2014 came together with residents and the city of Philadelphia to fund and invest in Chinatown, and you should too.\u00a0\nThe next time you walk through the gate, remember that the fight for Philadelphia\u2019s Chinatown, and Chinatowns everywhere, is not over. Speak up and fight for the movement so that history does not repeat itself.\nMore resources:\nGoFundMe for Ginger Arts Center\nAsian Arts Initiative\nGet our newsletter, DP Daybreak, delivered to your inbox every weekday morning.Youth Against Displacement\nLIALA SOFI is a College junior from Roanoke, Va.

          "title": "Caroline Magdolen | \u201cEveryone cheats.\u201d What can we do about it?",
          "article_content": "My guess is that nearly everyone reading this article knows someone who has been academically disingenuous, or been that someone before. Being academically dishonest isn\u2019t all about flashy examples, like the two admitted Penn students accused of plagiarism and fabricating data in 2022. There are smaller violations that may feel less egregious, or even harmless, like querying ChatGPT for help completing your homework, peeking at a friend\u2019s lab assignment, or answering a PollEverywhere as if you\u2019re in class, when really, you\u2019re snoozing in your dorm.\nAcademic dishonesty is having a moment in the spotlight. The advent of generative AI, the use of which cannot be reliably detected by grading softwares, will likely upend student learning for better or worse. At the same time, examples of plagiarism by prominent academics are being dug up left and right. The former president of Harvard, Claudine Gay, was ousted in part due to plagiarism concerns, and Business Insider found that former MIT professor Neri Oxman (the wife of billionaire Bill Ackman, who led the campaign against Gay) \u201cstole sentences and whole paragraphs from Wikipedia, other scholars and technical documents in her academic writing.\u201d\n\t\tTo be clear, I believe that academic dishonesty at Penn \u2014 going against community standards that your professor has explicitly outlined \u2014 is unacceptable, and that we should be doing more to penalize and prevent it.\nNevertheless, we must also acknowledge that academic dishonesty is understandable, in that we can piece together students\u2019 rationales when they do cheat, and even sympathize with them in some cases.\n\t\t\t\tSEE MORE FROM CAROLINE MAGDOLEN:\ufeffThe Rat Kings of PennThere\u2019s no better time for climate education\ufeffTo dissuade academic dishonesty, we employ sayings like, \u201cIt will only hurt you in the long run to cheat,\u201d or \u201cYou\u2019re taking advantage of other students who've completed their work fairly.\u201d This is true in some circumstances. If you\u2019re an aspiring quant and you\u2019re asking ChatGPT to calculate all of the derivatives on your MATH 1400 homework, it\u2019s going to show: First in your exams for the class, then in every math class you take thereafter, and especially in your future career. And if MATH 1400 is curved, your dishonest success capitalizes on the honest failures of others \u2014 not cool.\nBut this is not true in all cases. Jane* was a first year in her spring term when she was taking CIS 1210: Data Structures and Algorithms \u2014 a famously challenging CIS course \u2014 with Rajiv Gandhi, a famously challenging professor.\u00a0\n\tShe cheated on her coding assignment late into the semester, and as per the professor\u2019s policy, received a -300/100 on the submitted homework and zeros on all previously submitted homework, receiving a D as her final grade in the course.\nBut Jane believes that what is more important to her story is not what happened, but why it happened.\u00a0\n\u201cWhat drove me to make a bad decision? Why are [these classes] so infamous? It\u2019s because of notorious policies where you cannot collaborate on many assignments. You are given long problem sets to do, on your own, each week, with desperate students in office hour queues that are two to four hours long. Many times, you will go to the TA and not get a clear answer. It is a profoundly isolating situation, particularly for freshmen just entering college, and that\u2019s what drives well-meaning people to cheat.\u201d\nBased on my conversation with Jane, it seemed that she felt isolated at the time and was struggling to reach out for the support that she needed, both in CIS 1210 and at Penn as a whole. And given the limited support Jane could receive from TAs and her instructor, backtracking her friend\u2019s code felt more conducive to her learning than doing nothing.\nJane expressed a lot of remorse over what happened, and said that she still has a lot of respect for Rajiv, maintaining a good relationship with him to this day. She was also grateful that Rajiv was willing to handle this internally, since a low grade in the class looks better than a formal statement on her transcript, detailing her violation of academic integrity.\n\u201cI deserved to be punished harshly,\u201d Jane said. \u201cBut the collaboration policies of these introductory courses, and the punishment I received, wrecked my self-esteem and my early college experience. I felt that there was no way out.\u201d\nAccording to Jane, Rajiv's philosophy is to \"let go of your grades early: the sooner you stop caring about your GPA and start caring about learning, the better.\" She agrees with this philosophy, especially since he curves his courses generously, but sees this as out of touch with the realities of many Penn students.\nAfter students have prioritized perfecting their grades and resumes (and have been praised for it) in high school, those habits won\u2019t get undone overnight. Even at Penn, there are many institutions and accolades that continue to reward \u201cperfect\u201d performance over pursuing difficult academic disciplines, experimenting, and invariably messing up sometimes.\nFrankly, for a pre-med student in computer science (a track which Jane was considering at the time), the adage that \u201ccheating will hurt you in the long run\u201d skill-wise doesn\u2019t hold much water. The skillset of a future doctor and a software engineer just don\u2019t overlap enough. What can hurt a pre-med in the long run is a low GPA.\nAnd while there are some students for whom projects, internships, and technical interviews will get them a lot further in guaranteeing their success, this is not true for everyone. For many preprofessional students who may want to challenge themselves with a major or minor in CIS, they risk getting shut out of the study altogether.\nWhat frustrates me most about this entire situation is not that such harsh action was taken, but that it appears ineffective in tackling the issue at hand. If a student wanted to cheat, they could just take CIS 1600 or CIS 1210 during a different semester, when a different instructor was in charge and penalties were anecdotally known for being less harsh.\nWhile Jane\u2019s actions were clearly wrong, I can\u2019t help thinking that she was just the unlucky example that had to face the music, and she said as much in our interview: \u201cEveryone cheats in this class. You don\u2019t survive [CIS 1600 or CIS 1210] without talking to people, it just depends on whether you get caught. That doesn\u2019t make cheating okay, but it does mean that we need to rethink how these courses operate.\u201d\nSo, what can we do so that not everyone cheats?\nThis is a complex question, and there is no easy answer. It is crucial that as we frame the issue of academic integrity violations, we look at both the violations themselves and the root motivations that drive them \u2014 these actions are not taking place in a vacuum.\u00a0\nAcademic integrity violations these days are, to an extent, simply easier to commit. ChatGPT has led to a surge in \u201cunfair advantage\u201d violations. And even before generative AI, the pandemic had uprooted our usual test-taking environment. Now that classes are in person again, we no longer need to have take-home or open-Internet exams, but these still persist in some classes, and are easier to cheat on. Penn, given its history of fraudulent alumni, isn\u2019t going to be a place where professors can blindly trust students to refrain from cheating when presented with the option, so professors should take some responsibility for leveling the playing field in the classroom too.\u00a0\nJulie Nettleton, the executive director of Penn\u2019s Center for Community Standards and Accountability (CSA), relayed over email that CSA already works closely with schools and centralized resources at Penn to discuss how to proctor exams, and with faculty to discuss exams, syllabi language, and classroom policies.\nWhat constitutes a violation itself is currently not standard across classes, or even across different sections of the same class. How to handle a concern of academic integrity falls to the professor first \u2014 this is how Jane completed CIS 1210 with a lower grade, rather than a formal sanction from the CSA. It makes sense to delegate this responsibility to professors: It is more efficient than having the CSA handle every case, and professors should have the freedom to decide what constitutes cheating in their classrooms.\nHowever, this does open the door to students deliberately choosing sections of a course with professors that have more relaxed academic integrity policies. Conversely, some professors can be overly harsh, to the point where they are acting unfairly towards their students.\u00a0\nJill*, another student that I interviewed for this article, was falsely accused by her professor of collaborating on her final exam with her peers. At the start of winter break, the professor sent a class-wide email imploring those who worked together on the take-home exam to turn themselves in or have the matter escalated. Jill recalls that for students that turned themselves in, the professor lowered their grades accordingly \u2014 everyone else was reported to the CSA.\nIn the end, Jill\u2019s name was cleared, but she was assigned a case manager that seemed to have assumed she was guilty by default. As the case progressed, many of the details that the professor used to build the case against her appeared superfluous \u2014 for example, she and her friends had all rounded to the same decimal place in their work. Jill suspects that the escalation may have been personal: she had previously asked the professor, on behalf of the class, if he could make changes to his teaching style to facilitate learning.\nIt seems wrong to me that a professor could accuse a student and cause such extensive stress when in the end, Jill turned out to be innocent. It reminded me of some other methods that professors use to catch students cheating, such as Turnitin\u2019s flawed AI detector.\nPart of the solution to rampant academic dishonesty may also lie in expanding our vocabulary to discuss the issue, as John McWhorter pointed out in The New York Times. A class-wide cheating ring, direct plagiarism of original ideas from a paper as one\u2019s own, and copying a line of someone\u2019s code all constitute academic dishonesty, but range broadly in terms of severity and \u201cease of catching.\u201d However, this is rarely reflected in academic integrity policies.\u00a0\nIt can be awkward to suggest that some forms of dishonesty are worse than others, and more awkward still to draw the line between different punishments for different violations, but we must still have these conversations.\u00a0\nWhat should constitute dishonesty at all? When speaking with Jane, she would often circle back to how isolating it was to work alone on her assignments as a first year in introductory computer science courses, particularly as a woman in STEM. Every day, she would walk out of class \u201cfeeling way worse about [her]self.\u201d Now exploring chemistry, physics, and biology courses, she greatly appreciates the change in her academic environment, where students are encouraged to openly collaborate. The grade medians in chemistry are similar to those in CIS (which is to say, not great), but Jane is not as stressed as she was in CIS 1210, since she studies with her friends, and they can struggle and ask for help together.\u00a0\nWhile it was dishonest of Jane to copy code when it was against CIS 1210 policy, perhaps CIS majors and minors would learn more from the course if they were in a more collaborative environment to begin with. Jane has suggested that CIS 1210 should find a middle ground where students can learn from each other, but not be overly reliant on collaboration to perform well on exams.\u00a0\nShe also argues that there should be more opportunities for students to admit to academic dishonesty \u2014 through a friend at Stanford, she heard that at the end of a computer science class, students can select the assignments they have cheated on and receive a negative score on them, or risk facing more uncertain penalties if they are later caught.\u00a0\n\u201cThis policy gives people a second chance to do the right thing, and I do believe that you learn from an experience if you own up to it,\u201d Jane said.\nDeliberations over how best to address academic dishonesty can go on without end, but unfortunately this column must do just that.

          "title": "Jack Lakis | What we can learn from Penn\u2019s college ranking",
          "article_content": "Last fall, a plethora of new results from U.S. News & World Report, Wall Street Journal, and Forbes elevated Penn in their national college rankings. Nearly every list places Penn among the top 10, some going as far as placing the University among the top five. This universal growth resulted from a key change in most of these sources\u2019 metrics: greater consideration given to postgraduate salaries.\nPenn famously has one of the highest-earning alumni bodies in the country. Starting salaries for Penn graduates are often considered the highest in the Ivy League. By mid-career, the average Penn alum is raking in $165,000 annually, while the national average for a college graduate caps out at $74,000.\n\t\tPenn draws a great deal of prestige from its potential to produce high earners, which is a direct result of our school\u2019s preprofessional culture. Nearly 50% of all Penn graduates enter one of two career fields: consulting or finance. This pipeline allows most Penn alumni to matriculate into high-paying jobs shortly after graduation.\nI\u2019m usually a defender of preprofessionalism. It\u2019s crucial that Penn graduates are able to find good jobs, and high salary potential is an immense advantage. But those jobs aren\u2019t everything. Many universities are making gains in rankings and name recognition based on alumni outcomes in public service careers.\n\t\t\t\t\ufeffSEE MORE FROM JACK LAKIS:\ufeffDo we all hate Penn?Staying focused after Magill's resignation\ufeffFor example, Harvard University boasts about its eight presidential alumni. However, when 1968 Wharton graduate Donald Trump was elected president, Penn mostly ignored his history with the school. Given his proximity to controversy and his unconventional political history, Penn\u2019s bump in prestige was limited by Trump\u2019s election. Our second closest claim to the White House is the University\u2019s relationship with President Joe Biden and the opening of the Penn Biden Center. I argue that this is as far as Penn\u2019s ties to the presidency will go. Nowadays, Penn\u2019s laser focus on professional development might repel students who will one day have presidential potential.\nComparable institutions to Penn have high-earning graduates and prestigious placements throughout the government, nonprofit sector, and the advocacy space. For example, Georgetown University feeds graduates into congressional offices and many Fulbright programs. Princeton University also regularly features its flashy roster of graduates in powerful political offices. These universities maintain a strong presence in the private sector but are also actively represented in government positions.\n\tIn these examples, the institution itself sponsors an undergraduate school dedicated to public service. At Georgetown, it\u2019s the School of Foreign Service, while at Princeton the role is filled by the School of Public and International Affairs.\nI propose that Penn follow suit and create a fifth undergraduate school dedicated to public affairs. This new school could absorb Penn\u2019s wildly popular social science programs, like PPE (Philosophy, Politics and Economics), Political Science, and Economics. Currently, most students in these majors are scooped up by consulting firms and investment banks. If these students were given an intentional focus on service and social responsibility, perhaps they could feel empowered to use their degrees in a more meaningful way.\nThe least Penn can do is expand its current effort to bridge the gap between social science degree seekers and careers in government and nonprofits. It\u2019s crucial that our student body actively engages with the robust policy infrastructure that Penn has already made available: Civic House, Perry World House, opportunities like Penn in Washington, and extracurricular engagements offered by the Government and Politics Association. From what I\u2019ve seen, these resources are underutilized at Penn. By snubbing them, Penn students are working against the general interests of the University to gain prestige.\n\t\tGet our newsletter, DP Daybreak, delivered to your inbox every weekday morning.Besides, it's about more than just rankings. We have the potential to empower our students to become leaders in society. TIME Magazine ranks Penn as the third-best college for aspiring leaders. However, the article states its rationale for this placement as a concentration of graduates in business careers. Other chart-topping schools on this list were noted for their programs in law, medicine, and more.\nUltimately, private sector homogeneity marks one of Penn\u2019s key weaknesses. As we move forward, Penn has a duty to educate leaders in more than one field. If Penn strengthened its programs in civic engagement, more graduates would be inclined to pursue roles in government and could elevate Penn\u2019s cultural stature. We should be known for more than salaries. We can do more than business.\nJACK LAKIS is a College first year studying political science from Kennesaw, Ga.

          "title": "Mia Vesely | Black Penn is vibrant this month and every month",
          "article_content": "As of late, most of my columns have focused on things I take issue with: Whether it\u2019s Liz Magill\u2019s resignation and the threats to free speech on campus, or the lack of racial diversity in Panhellenic sororities. I haven't highlighted the things that I truly appreciate and, more specifically, the places in which I\u2019ve found community at Penn.\nLast February, I argued that Black history is important for everyone. Education surrounding Black people, their lives, and their contributions should be integrated into the standard curriculum. Black Penn shows up and shows out every month, but this month in particular, there are many events and ways that Penn student organizations uplift the community and come together.\u00a0\n\t\tIt would be impossible to touch on all of these amazing events and their impacts, but I\u2019d like to paint a picture of some of these groups and their initiatives during this month and beyond. Planning for these events takes months. For example, when Descendants of Afro-Americans at Penn (DAAP) \u2014 a club founded just last year \u2014 put on their first-ever gala on Feb. 1 to kick off the month, you better believe that the event was well-planned and executed.\u00a0\nThe gala \u2014 Red Carpet For A Cause \u2014 supported the Sickle Cell Disease Association of America's Philadelphia and Delaware Valley Chapter. The night included catered food, live performances from student groups like The Inspiration, wonderful community, and beautiful decor\u2014even including an ice sculpture of the DAAP logo. Over $1,700 was raised in support of the foundation.\n\t\t\t\tSEE MORE FROM MIA VESELY:\ufeffI dropped sorority rush and I\u2019m gladFirst Liz Magill, next free speechWhen asked about the impacts of the event, College sophomore and DAAP founding member Clarke Dickens said, \u201cWe wanted to bring the community together for a great cause, especially a cause that affects a lot of African Americans and Black people more broadly.\u201d\nSickle cell disease occurs in about one in every 365 Black babies born in the United States. The percentage of Black people who carry the trait is even higher, with one in 13 Black babies being born as carriers.\n\tDickens is not just involved with DAAP, but is also on the boards for QBlack and Shea Collective.\nThese clubs are all part of something commonly dubbed \u201cBlack Penn,\u201d which focuses on so many different aspects of identity. From cultural organizations like Penn African Student Association (PASA), to preprofessional organizations like Black Wharton and the Black Pre-Law Association (BPLA), to community service organizations like the NAACP, all of these organizations put an emphasis on service both inside the Penn community and out.\u00a0\nFor example, Campus Curlz \u2014 a club I serve on the board of \u2014 is, at first glance, a club centered around uplifting natural hair and embracing positivity. \u00a0But underlying hair mask making events and movie nights, there is a strong commitment to service. Just this month, the community service committee held an event where we made Valentine\u2019s Day cards for senior citizens at Mercy Life West Philadelphia.\nService by board members is a requirement to be part of funding organizations like UMOJA \u2014 the umbrella funding organization for Black clubs \u2014 and even beyond that, many clubs center service in every activity they partake in. Whether you\u2019re on the board of a club or not, there are many service opportunities available and encouraged.\nWhen asked what they wish people knew about Black Penn, Dickens said, \u201cClubs should make an effort to include grad students, it makes all the difference. I\u2019m able to say, \u2018This is what I would look like coming here for grad school,\u2019 and it can even offer opportunities for mentorship.\u201d\nWhat seems to drive Black Penn is first and foremost the students, then the supportive and involved faculty, as well as the local partnerships and opportunities the clubs find, build, and pursue for themselves. Many members of the DAAP board are native to Philadelphia, so that makes their work even more personal.\nWhile Black students do take initiative to realize what they need and create the spaces they want to see, there is so much room for improvement on behalf of Penn: whether it\u2019s stratifying the way funding is given to these clubs \u2014 they often can\u2019t fund silverware in UMOJA meetings if it can be provided elsewhere \u2014 or improving the cultural spaces available to students (we were promised the ARCH \u2018building,\u2019 not the ARCH \u2018basement\u2019). In months like February, Penn aims to spotlight their Black students. I just wish this recognition of the incredible community Black students forged for themselves, when they initially didn\u2019t see it on campus, came year-round.\n\t\tGet our newsletter, DP Daybreak, delivered to your inbox every weekday morning.Events like DAAP's gala happen every month, and it\u2019s important not to understate the role these organizations play in making Penn a welcoming and accepting place for students from marginalized backgrounds.\nI was happy to see Faces of Black Penn \u2014 a Black-run publication \u2014 highlighted in the DP last week. I hope people continue to uplift the work of these student groups going forward and make space to give all students their roses.

          "title": "Bernadine Kumi | I joined a sorority and I\u2019m glad",
          "article_content": "I\u2019ll be honest: I was not a fan of Greek life when I first got to Penn. My perception of Greek life was influenced by growing up in the South, mainly in suburban Georgia. This included a sorority scene of girls with fake spray tans and little to no personality. The images of sorority girls from the University of Georgia and Alabama screamed no diversity, which made me wary of joining a sorority at Penn. Being a First-Generation, Low-Income (FGLI) student made me especially hesitant. Even more so, coming from a Ghanaian household, the notion of a sorority was immediately dismissed as something against our Christian values. Thus, during my first year, I knew I would never, and I mean never, join a sorority.\u00a0\nHowever, by the beginning of sophomore year, my mindset began to change. After a year on campus, I had found a solid community of a small group of friends. But beyond that, I felt that I did not really know anyone. I couldn\u2019t name more than 20 people in my grade. Penn is known for being a networking school, and the \u201cSocial Ivy,\u201d so I began to question just how much I had taken advantage of that. That, along with most of the underclassmen party scene revolving around fraternities, made the idea of rushing even more appealing.\u00a0\n\t\tSo while most people were beginning their sophomore year with the friends they already had, I began to look for additional friends. My twin sister, who also goes to Penn, and I began attending open rush events, talking to sophomores in sororities, and involving ourselves in more social events. Over the next few months, my days consisted of talking to many girls, going to dinners, and putting myself out there in a way that I had been hesitant to do before. I made new friends, met fellow sophomores also in search of a bigger community, and found myself loving the idea of joining a sorority.\u00a0\nBut what made me even more eager was just how inclusive and diverse sororities were at Penn, more so than I had been expecting\u2014especially the off-campus sorority I ended up joining, OAX. I was still wary about rushing, but as soon as I got to the first event, I immediately felt comfortable. There were girls with different interests, passions, economic backgrounds, and personalities. Not a single conversation felt forced. Every girl I met had a unique and authentic story, and I felt like I could talk to them for hours.\n\t\t\t\tSEE MORE FROM BERNADINE KUMI:\ufeffDining hall workers at Penn Hillel demand better treatment from UniversityI was especially captivated by BLOAX (Black OAX), a community within OAX that includes fellow girls of Ghanaian descent and other Black girls who provided me with guidance on navigating Penn as a Black woman. OAX also has other smaller communities, such as LatinOAX and RainbOAX. Being able to find other people with similar backgrounds made the choice to join a sorority that much easier.\u00a0\nAs a FGLI student and Questbridge scholar, the idea of paying high dues out of my minimal work paychecks every month was unfathomable. I knew that joining a sorority would pose another financial burden, and even though I was loving the OAX community, the idea of paying dues scared me. Yet once again, OAX and other sororities surprised me with their understanding and financial transparency. They worked with me to develop an affordable monthly payment plan so that I, like every other girl interested in rushing, could also enjoy being in a sorority.\u00a0\n\tSince the morning of Bid Day when I got \u201cthe call,\u201d I know that I truly made the right decision by joining a sorority, for not only my social life but my professional life too. This past fall, I was able to land a summer internship in Los Angeles with the help of my grand-big. I was also able to prepare for my interview with girls in my sorority, who gave me the confidence I needed to land the opportunity. As a Black woman and FGLI student, I have truly benefited from joining Greek life. I hope students who are hesitant to rush, just as I once was, will see my experience and how transformative it can be. I hope others \u2014 whether they are Black women, FGLI students, or just Penn students in search of a greater community \u2014 can do the same.\nBERNADINE KUMI is a College junior studying political science and legal studies and history from Roswell, Ga.

          "article_content": "Columnist Jessey Shin explores the problem of disparate advising quality in the College and argues \nfor a more standardized experience.\u201cMy advisor lied to me?\u201d\nI remember someone saying this to me in complete disbelief, but I can\u2019t say I\u2019m surprised. Advisors can be as misleading as they are helpful, and this is a widespread problem that needs addressing.\n\t\tIn the College, students typically have between 15 and 20 credits outside of their primary major to meet the graduation requirement. These are used to fulfill general education requirements, pursue a second major or minor, or take elective courses that align with a student\u2019s interests.\nThe freedom to pursue one\u2019s intellectual pursuits is, of course, one of the draws of the College. I am looking to pursue two majors myself, in somewhat interconnected but disparate fields of study: the flexibility offered by the curriculum allows me to explore these interests without taking an obscene number of classes.\n\t\t\t\tSEE MORE FROM JESSEY SHIN:Making a case for the less popular college housesNavigating the maze of Penn's resources\ufeffThe problem is few students go into their first year knowing which major they would like to pursue, much less exactly which courses to take.\u00a0\nThe College puts a lot of effort into informing incoming students about the curriculum and what they have to offer, such as through the Compass module on Canvas that gives a foray into some aspects of the College experience (something that other schools do not offer). However, the sheer number of options can be overwhelming, giving rise to a unique need for personalized, one-on-one guidance. This is where pre-major advisors come in.\u00a0\n\tPre-major advisors, assigned to each student before they start their first semester at Penn, are a vital resource for College students. They guide students through the course selection process, encouraging and helping them as they explore their various interests and eventually settle on a major.\nI can say that I have had a relatively good experience with my pre-major advisor. However, I also found that some of the advice offered was not fully applicable to my circumstance, because of the recent transition from Penn InTouch to Path@Penn.\nOther students, however, are not as lucky. I have heard stories about advisors making their students cry, spreading misinformation, jeopardizing their advisees\u2019 course registration, you name it.\nIn an interview, one student (who requested anonymity) shared that they have had trouble reaching their pre-major advisor from the get-go. College students must meet with their advisor one-on-one to get their course registration hold lifted; without this, they are not eligible to participate in advance registration. The student was only able to reach their advisor a day or so before the deadline and has continued to have trouble with availability.\nOf course, their pre-major advisor experience was less than ideal. \u201cHer guidance wasn\u2019t so much guidance as it was looking at the boxes and seeing if I checked them,\u201d they said. \u201cI don\u2019t think I would feel comfortable going to her for personal issues, such as which major to pursue or how to explore [some of my interests], because I don\u2019t think she would point me [in] the right direction.\u201d Instead, they had been utilizing their PennCAP advisor (available for FGLI students) for these concerns.\nOn the other hand, some students are able to form a positive relationship with their advisor and find that they are helpful in navigating their interests. Rishi Dadlani, a College first year, described his advisor as \u201cfriendly and helpful. He gave me his phone number and told me to contact him if I [had] any questions \u2026 If I saw him around campus, I would say hi, and he always sends us a beginning-of-semester email.\u201d\n\t\tGet our newsletter, DP Daybreak, delivered to your inbox every weekday morning.This disparity in advising quality means that some students are at a great disadvantage compared to others. While some advisors are able to \u201cpoint students in the right direction,\u201d helping them take the right step forward in their college experience, others fall short. Their advisees must navigate the complicated process of learning about the majors, gen-ed requirements, and figuring out (the surprisingly difficult) advance registration process on their own.\nWhen done right, the freedom of the College curriculum can allow students to truly delve into their academic interests and eventually settle on the right path for them. However, that process requires a lot of research and planning that is supposed to be aided by a pre-major advisor. For incoming first years who are unfamiliar with the landscape at Penn and underclassmen students, this disparity in advising quality poses a challenge. Penn must ensure that all students are able to best utilize the resources at their disposal, and the first place to start is with the guidance they receive.\nJESSEY SHIN is a College first-year studying sociology and communications from Seongnam-si, South Korea.

This month offers an opportunity to delve into the depths of history: exploring narratives that challenge, inspire, and provoke thought. In the spirit of true academic inquiry and in honor of this significant month, I wish to highlight a selection of works by Black authors whose perspectives might diverge from the more commonly embraced interpretations of Black history and culture.\n\t\tIn recommending these texts, my intention is not to endorse every opinion expressed by the authors, but to underscore the importance of engaging with a diversity of viewpoints. These authors challenge us to look beyond the prevailing orthodoxy and to question the narratives that have become commonplace within academic circles. They remind us that the Black American experience, like any aspect of human history, is richly diverse and complex.\nAs members of an academic community that prides itself on intellectual rigor and openness, it is our responsibility to explore a broad spectrum of perspectives, especially those that provoke debate and reflection.

          "article_content": "\u201cWelcome to Penn! You are the most diverse class we ever admitted!\u201d The convocation rhetoric makes you feel so special. Penn is diverse because a student comes from Wisconsin and another from Kazakhstan. One plays the flute, one plays squash. Never mind that all of them want to be bankers or consultants. I wish someone had told me that nearly every other person sitting at Convocation with me would end up in the funnel. That however diverse my first-year class was, my senior class would simply not be.\nAs a teaching assistant for Wharton\u2019s required \u201cBusiness and You\u201d leadership course, I mentor first years adjusting to college and exploring careers. Someone confessed, \u201cIf not banking, then what else could I possibly do?\u201d If the best business school in the world (U.S. News debates aside) makes you believe you only have one option from day one, the institution, culture, and entire system have fundamentally failed.\n\t\tOf course, there is nothing wrong with those jobs: The last thing we need is a trembling economic system and inefficient markets. The problem is blindly assuming that one in two employed Penn grads and 80% of Wharton grads woke up and consciously made such a decision. Unpacking our culture proves how little of a decision this is and how everything revolves around two words: prestige and control.\nIt is common knowledge by now that Penn students are privileged. However, you may not know that for every single student from the bottom 20%, over 21 people come from the top 20%, blithely offsetting their upbringing. The result? An abject elite detached from reality. Okay, perhaps this is cynical, but if we are known for our elitist \u201cseeing and being seen\u201d culture, is it a surprise that 25% of us are so disillusioned to think the average U.S. salary is above six figures? Of course not (both not surprising and not true).\n\t\t\t\tPenn\u2019s alarming lack of socioeconomic diversity (despite efforts acknowledged this) unequivocally creates a culture perpetuating the value of money at the expense of everything else. The people you sit next to in class distract you with their laptop screens: purchasing a Gucci bag or booking Airbnbs in Cancun. The emails you receive are about banking and consulting events. This is the model. The only one. The only one, right?\nLet\u2019s be honest, \u201cjust follow your passion\u201d won\u2019t pay the bills, and I cannot blame an indebted or underprivileged student for desiring financial freedom with a high-paying job. This is why I am not saying the Wall Street lifestyle is unethical, although like others, I could. I am saying this is only one way to live your life. One of infinitely many. Which one makes sense for YOU?\n\tEveryone at Penn is good at planning, several are good at doing, and almost none are good at reflecting. The purpose of your college education is not exclusively career preparation. If this is what they had you do, I hate to tell you that you have been robbed. As writer William Deresiewicz argues, \u201cWhat you should want to develop in college is the habit of reflection, which means the capacity for change because most of what you come across in college will inevitably fade from memory. What is left over, precisely, is you.\u201d A culture, even more so an institution, should give you the tools to understand what model of life you want to live, not impose the model on you.\nYet, my student's question is central and inevitable: What else if not banking?\nAsking yourself what truly energizes you is no easy task, because it requires the vulnerability to let go of the comforting lifetime certainty that the predetermined path gives you: 2025 summer recruiting, analyst, associate \u2026 Well, the desire to eliminate uncertainty eliminates life. What do you plan to do after \u201csome years of experience\u201d with your future free time and why on earth are you not doing it now?\nIn his book \u201cExcellent Sheep,\u201d Deresiewicz advocates for the importance of time off, slowing down, breaking the cycle of endless achievement, and acknowledging the existence of a world outside of your Ivy League. It may be scandalous to some and unmistakable to others, but what if you replaced your obsessive passion for finance with one that is harmonious, perhaps exploring capacities you have not had a chance to cultivate? What if you did something you purposefully cannot put on a resume or post on LinkedIn? Yes, you may be \u201cbehind\u201d those who doubtlessly persist in the hierarchy, but what is the purpose of being at the top if you are climbing the wrong mountain?\n\t\tGet our newsletter, DP Daybreak, delivered to your inbox every weekday morning.The main idea behind the Pathless Path is not to neglect the ambition that got us where we are (not even to stop using Path@Penn), but rather to remember that Penn is not a four-year treadmill to (and playground for) the American elite. Yes, it was founded for them, but Penn\u2019s core mission today is the pursuit, enhancement, and dissemination of knowledge. We need to be aware of and manage our bewitching instinct to desire control and the social need for status. The truth is you cannot eradicate control and prestige. Just stop watering them. Like the French say, \u201cl\u00e2cher prise.\u201d\nLiberal education puts everything at risk and requires you to risk everything. The process is by no means comfortable, but it is liberating and extraordinary. If it happens right, it feels like giving birth to yourself.

          "article_content": "Columnist Mariana Martinez describes her personal experiences with Penn's dining services.A text from my friend lit up my phone.\u00a0\n\u201cDude, you\u2019re literally getting the reverse Freshman 15!\u201d\n\t\t\u201cThe what?\u201d I replied.\nAs an international student, I had no idea that Freshman 15 was a thing. But by the time I found out what it was, it was already too late. My eating schedule became very irregular: I skipped meals thinking it was more practical for me. Because of Penn\u2019s poor dining services and few inclusive food options, my physical and mental health were severely affected by the end of my first semester.\u00a0\n\t\t\t\t\ufeffBefore coming to Penn, when people asked me what I would miss most from Colombia, I usually answered by saying I'd miss the food. But as my first semester flew by, I realized it went beyond missing my country\u2019s food and more into an overwhelming transition and violent adjustment to the American diet, characterized by fast-food consumption, takeout over-reliance, and a lack of fresh food. It made my transition to college even more overwhelming than it already was.\u00a0\nI never expected diet to pose the challenge it did during my first semester. I didn\u2019t expect my food options to narrow so suddenly. The differences between the American and other countries\u2019 diets cause international students to mess up their meal structure. In the midst of the American diet, breakfast becomes the least important meal, meal times become arbitrary, and late dinners are frequent.\u00a0\n\tI found myself skipping breakfast because I couldn\u2019t tolerate American breakfast foods: bacon, potatoes, sausage, casseroles. I stopped eating fruit, and I started eating only one large meal a day. At the same time, I was pushing myself to be my best in my classes, clubs, and job while running on very little fuel. By winter break, my body was pretty much destroyed.\nAs I asked other international students about their dining habits, I found that my experience was not an isolated one. Some of them told me that they \u201cjust don\u2019t know what to eat anymore.\u201d Others said that because of their international status, they had a limited budget to eat off-campus and that relying on Penn\u2019s terrible food was torturous.\u00a0\nSurveys have shown that as international students transition into their lives at American universities, many face dietary challenges and health consequences. For instance, many international students report a halt in their fruit and vegetable consumption because they believe the United States\u2019 options are not as fresh. Others report severe weight loss/gain and stomach issues from struggling to adapt to an American diet that consists mainly of meals large in sugars and fat.\u00a0\nBack in Colombia, I was used to having almost five meals a day. My diet included cereals and a variety of meats, vegetables, and fruits. Other international students also report being accustomed to multi-course meals, often characterized by a careful, homemade preparation. On the other hand, the American diet narrows down choices abruptly. International students describe their choices as pizza, salad, pasta, French fries, sandwiches, and chicken \u2014 which holds true to the quintessential Penn dining experience.\u00a0\n\t\tGet our newsletter, DP Daybreak, delivered to your inbox every weekday morning.Being thrown into a poor dietary environment has a significant impact on students\u2019 mental health. Many studies show that students with poor dietary conditions are more likely to suffer from depression and anxiety. The dietary conditions at Penn have impacted my emotional well-being: It is very frustrating to feel like I have no high-quality dining options. The strain on my wallet as I buy groceries and off-campus food is also stressful, considering around a third of Penn\u2019s international students are on financial aid.\u00a0\nThe international student experience with the food at Penn can only be described as aggravating. Not only is the American diet more unhealthy than food in international students\u2019 countries, but it also causes disruptions in meal structure and health. As a school that prides itself on being diverse, Penn should really focus on making the dining experience more accessible for its international students. Not to mention an improvement in the food would benefit the whole student body, given recent events. It is clear that this becomes a matter beyond just food: it\u2019s also about inclusivity, general well-being, and enjoying the college experience.\u00a0\nMARIANA MARTINEZ is a College first year studying English and classics from Bogot\u00e1, Colombia.

          "title": "Chapin Lenthall-Cleary | The Penn administration farcically mistreats new student clubs",
          "article_content": "Guest Columnist Chapin Lenthall-Cleary highlights the bureaucratic hurdles that face student organizations and clubs at Penn.It's no secret that many of the University's student clubs are brutally exclusive \u2014 often demanding prospective members submit applications and participate in interviews \u2014 only to bar most of them from participating anyway. It's no secret that this system of club exclusivity inflicts a variety of harms on students: It deprives them of opportunities to participate in academic, service, recreational, and other activities. It shuts them out of a significant avenue of making friends. It pits students against each other. It furthers a culture obsessed with credentials over learning (or whatever a club's mission might be). And, as if all of that weren't damaging enough, it wastes non-trivial amounts of students' limited time at the University.\u00a0\nIt's far less well known, however, that the University's administration \u2014 especially the Office of Student Affairs \u2014 imposes numerous stringent, farcical, and sometimes nearly insurmountable hurdles upon new, often open-membership clubs.\u00a0\n\t\tIn October 2022, I founded Penn Humans vs. Zombies (HvZ), a (then-unofficial) club that held live-action zombie apocalypse games with Nerf blasters in David Rittenhouse Laboratory. The games were open to everyone and attracted a range of undergraduates across various schools, plus graduate students, alumni, a few students from nearby schools, and occasionally a professor. We required no applications or interviews, even for club leadership positions, which were filled by those willing to do the extra work to help run the games. Against even the advice of some club officers, I refused to charge admission.\u00a0\nI don't want to oversell this: Lance or not, I wasn't killing any windmills. One silly game with an earnest mission, of course, wasn't fixing a broken system, nor was HvZ the only open-membership club at Penn. But HvZ was at least one example of something the University desperately needs and badly, though not completely, lacks places for Penn students to find community and friends with shared interests, free from demands to run a marathon in a rat race just for a chance at being let in the gate. In fact, my uncompromisingly open-membership policies are exactly what even OSA claims to want.\n\t\t\t\tSEE MORE FROM \ufeffOPINION:\ufeffEmily Chang | No Senator, not all Asians are ChineseKiyah Akins | How I have been shaped by Black historyAbout a year passed before I realized that our zombies weren\u2019t the most soulless people HvZ would have to face. Last fall, after hearing about HvZ, the building manager contacted me, demanded that I stop the games, and revoked my 24/7 access to DRL. I reluctantly agreed to stop holding the games in DRL, but I reached out to the director of OSA to appeal the decision, where I was met with a tsunami of bureaucracy and an instruction to stop the games until they gave approval. The process involved meetings between multiple members of OSA, public safety, risk management, and others. When I asked to be involved in these discussions, I received the canned reply, \"[OSA has] not traditionally included students at this stage of conversation.\"\u00a0\nIt took over a month to get permission from OSA to continue the games and about as long to sort out the actual process of getting a space. There was just one problem: OSA's Kafka-and-friends committee decided that HvZ had to occur in an athletic space. When I tried to rent such a space, I discovered that doing so would cost $75 an hour, or around $4,500 per semester for a four-hour game once a week, an impossible cost for our club. When I told the OSA director that having to pay this fee to continue our game would be as good as a death sentence for HvZ and asked for the fee to be waived or paid, I was told to go find funding. I'll say that again: We spent months waiting, only to be told that we needed to find a way to get the University to pay us thousands of dollars \u2014 that we'd use to pay Penn the fee they decided to charge us \u2014 to play a game that costs them nothing.\n\tI did everything the OSA director suggested and more to try to get funding. As it currently stands, we have only a small fraction of what we actually need. And, I'm not hopeful, because this isn't the first time I've tried to get funding for a club.\u00a0\nLast winter, I founded Drone Club, another open-membership club. This one was dedicated to building drones, and I was willing to teach less experienced students the electronics, soldering, physics, and skills involved in doing so. Initially, I paid largely out-of-pocket for parts, but this wasn't ideal or particularly sustainable, so I sought club funding. With significant effort and about a month's delay, we got $220, about half of what we requested, from the Common Funding Application, the very funding source the OSA director suggested we use to find thousands of dollars for HvZ. In fall 2023, in order to secure larger, more regular funding, I applied for SAC recognition, the primary avenue for regular club funding, for Drone Club.\u00a0\nDrone Club was rejected for the sole reason of not having been on the PennClubs website since Oct. 31, 2022 (yes, that\u2019s over a year before we applied, and it\u2019s different from the deadline listed on the SAC website). The stated reason for the requirement that inspired that rejection is that \"student groups must be sustainable,\" which requiring students to check a box a year in advance obviously does little to confirm. Indeed, as I noted in Drone Club's application, where I asked SAC \"not to reject us upon a technicality, and instead judge us upon our merits,\" Drone Club's mostly underclassman membership is an infinitely better metric for sustainability.\u00a0\nEven clubs that are accepted still aren't written into the SAC budget until the school year after applying. Combined together, these requirements mean that, even if nothing goes wrong, a new club takes years to receive SAC budget funding. Under the current system, a sophomore who started a club now would graduate before having a chance at seeing any SAC budget funding.\u00a0\nThe above is only a small fraction of the examples of Penn institutions' hostility towards new clubs: being denied tables at the activity fair, having Drone Club removed from the PennClubs website for not getting Engineering Student Activities Council recognition (which, according to the PennClubs website, isn't a requirement), and more. If you're shocked by the severity and regularity of this problem, keep in mind that these are only examples of the University's administration\u2019s hostility towards new, open-membership clubs that I run (and therefore know about), which are doubtlessly a tiny subset of the full problem.\u00a0\n\t\tGet our newsletter, DP Daybreak, delivered to your inbox every weekday morning.Despite this relentless onslaught, I still don't know how this story ends. There's still a scenario where a powerful administrator decides to put the welfare of students above rules and diktats, and says, \"Enough of this nonsense,\" and HvZ gets to return triumphantly to DRL, or at least to another good location, free from extortionate fees. There's still a scenario where Drone Club secures its funding for parts, and the many other clubs doubtlessly facing similar farcical obstacles are instead met with a well-lit road, not numerous Harnwell-and-a-half-high hurdles. Heck, there's still a scenario where OSA lives up to its stated ideals and starts staunchly supporting open-membership clubs and exerting real force to get closed-membership clubs to open up.\u00a0\nThis hasn't been a happy story, and I'm frankly not betting on that changing. Nor, sadly, would a single exception for HvZ solve this massive harm to students, thrilled though I\u2019d be to get such an exception. But this story isn\u2019t over yet. If enough people, or even one person with enough power, decide to end this farce today and decide that doing right by students must always come first, there could yet be not only a happy ending to HvZ's struggle but also a bright future for all open-membership clubs at the University. To the administrators who\u2019ve caused this damage and to those who have the power to fix it, shape up.\nCHAPIN LENTHALL-CLEARY is a College senior studying physics and philosophy from Radnor, Pa.

          "article_content": "This semester, I somehow ended up with four out of my five classes being either directly or indirectly about ethics. As a political science major, I was really excited to take these classes, since whenever people talk about ethics nowadays, it mostly has to do with politics or international relations.\nAt a time when our reality changes so rapidly because of technology, and when we are faced with a number of global challenges, some people have forgotten about the importance of acting morally. Especially at a place like Penn, where everyone seems to be extremely worried about their future and their careers, people often disregard these values when they are caught up by the competitive environment. Because of this, one would think that ethics classes would be extremely beneficial for all, but do they actually contribute to making students more ethical individuals?\n\t\tAccording to my professors, they don\u2019t.\nIn all four ethics classes, my professors started the semester by telling us that ethics classes will not make most of us more ethical. I sat there, listening to all of them, and I just could not understand why they would say something like that. If I wasn\u2019t going to learn anything, what was the point of taking these classes?\n\t\t\t\tSEE MORE FROM ZARA TENA:The urgent need for younger voices in politics\ufeffIt\u2019s okay to be ordinaryThat\u2019s where I was wrong: I have been learning a lot.

By taking these classes, I might not become a better person, but they have given me a space where I can explore, discuss, and reflect about where I stand on so many issues and what my beliefs about morality actually are.\nEthics is not a subject that can be forcefully taught through lectures and readings. There is no way that we can sit down for three hours every week and magically become more ethical just because we memorize theories and read long papers written by old white men. The goal of these classes is not to tell us what is \u2018right\u2019 or \u2018wrong,\u2019 \u00a0but to give us the skills to navigate the gray areas in ethical decision making.\n\tThese classes encourage self reflection and personal growth. Even when analyzing big case studies or exploring different theories, students are pushed to question their own values, beliefs, and biases. While this may not guarantee that we will completely transform our moral compasses, the self awareness that comes from these reflections creates a great foundation for understanding why we act the way we do and also invites us to try to understand others.\nThe fact that ethics classes begin with a warning \u2014 that you won\u2019t become more ethical by taking them \u2014 should not stop anyone from giving them a chance. The ability to think critically, understand different values and perspectives, and have the skills to self reflect are essential parts of any college education. They prepare students for the complicated moral dilemmas they might face in their personal and professional lives \u2014 especially when most people at Penn will end up with jobs that are notorious for their ethical scandals!\nZARA TENA is a College sophomore studying political science from Puebla, Mexico.

          "article_content": "How many times have you found yourself in a never-ending cycle of back-and-forth messages, trying to pin down a date for a long overdue catch up with a friend? Every get together begins to feel as if it requires intricate planning and strips away the simplicity of social connection. This routine becomes stifling, lacking spontaneity and authenticity; you\u2019re constrained to coordinating with the same faces in the same places.\u00a0\nThis is what I like to call scheduling fatigue.\u00a0\n\t\tAs a result of this phenomenon, gatherings among friends are beginning to resemble scheduled business meetings, meticulously arranged via tools like When2Meet or synchronized Google Calendars.\nWhile resorting to scheduling may seem like the only viable option to maintain a semblance of social connection, perhaps it's time to embrace the idea of venturing out solo: I\u2019m challenging you to go on an unplanned side quest all by yourself to a third place.\u00a0\n\t\t\t\tMORE FROM LALA MUSTAFA:A nation on defense: Dismantling misinformation against Azerbaijan in the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict\ufeff\ufeffAllow me to explain. Picture the first place as your home and the second as your place of education or work. Now, the third place emerges as a public sphere where individuals congregate, not out of any obligation like in the previously mentioned locations, but, for lack of a more precise term, to simply vibe. It could be the cozy corner of a cafe, a communal park, or even the neighborhood barbershop \u2014 anywhere that\u2019ll allow you to interact with people outside your usual circles.\u00a0\nYet, at many universities like Penn, the concept of a third place seems all but lost as our lives remain restricted to school grounds, causing even our first and second places to converge into one. While spots on campus \u2014 like Stommons, Pret, or the cultural centers in ARCH \u2014 can offer some respite, they often come with the latent pressure of being on the clock. Conversations here revolve around assignments, internships, and the intricacies of Penn culture. The chances of an unexpected encounter dwindle given that most people in attendance will be other Penn students. As we\u2019re cocooned in the Penn bubble, it comes as no surprise that many students spend their four years in Philadelphia without ever fully exploring it.\u00a0\n\tYet, this insulation comes at a cost that extends far beyond what we realize.\u00a0\nIt severs our connection not only from the outside world but also from ourselves. That is, within such limits, our individuality dwindles, reducing us to mere roles influenced by our peers. By excluding ourselves from a wider social sphere, we inhibit opportunities to engage with diverse perspectives, trap ourselves in a cycle of familiarity, and risk leading monotonous lives that pave the way to burnout.\nHowever, in our lives, both intimacy and affiliation with broader communities are essential. While intimacy often stems from our immediate circles, affiliation thrives in third places where spontaneous interactions occur. These spaces facilitate easy contact with new individuals on a regular basis, without the need for prior scheduling. As they consistently offer an opportunity for interaction with others, they end up cultivating the most reliable form of socialization.\u00a0\nSo, if you are keen on exploring new horizons and getting involved in the Philadelphia community, I suggest checking out the many informative articles dedicated to bursting the Penn bubble.\nNevertheless, I want to avoid confining third places to physical locations. They\u2019re more of a mindset, a willingness to embrace spontaneity wherever it may arise. They don't have to be far from campus or require spending money. Instead, third places can be any informal spots you visit \u2014 whether it's your student lounge, the library, or a community center.\u00a0\n\t\tGet our newsletter, DP Daybreak, delivered to your inbox every weekday morning.We often find ourselves caught up in the routines of daily life, clinging to familiar patterns of scheduling and social interaction.

          "title": "Beatriz B\u00e1ez | No closed captioning available",
          "article_content": "Columnist Beatriz B\u00e1ez explains her experience with language fatigue at Penn.On my first day at Penn, I called my father in distress, telling him I needed to move back home and study there as I was going to die alone at this university. My father asked why, and I quickly responded, \u201cI haven\u2019t met anybody in three hours. I have no friends. It\u2019s over for me.\u201d\u00a0\nThat very same night, I went to a New Student Orientation event at Houston Hall. As I nervously paced the floor in my Crocs, I overheard some students speaking Spanish and immediately gravitated toward them. Confessing, \u201cI heard Spanish, and I feel saved,\u201d I ended up meeting three genuine individuals, all from various parts of Latin America. Having arrived in the United States, it felt comforting to hear voices that reminded me of home. This comfort is priceless in such a foreign environment.\n\t\tAll my life, I\u2019ve taken courses in Spanish, spoken Spanish at home, and been berated by my grandmother whenever I spoke too much English. Arriving at Penn, I didn\u2019t anticipate the struggle I would face taking classes taught in English, as I had been lucky enough to have been extensively taught English from a very young age.\nBut speaking in a second language most of the time, even as a fluent speaker, is incredibly draining. Meeting native Spanish speakers at Penn was truly a blessing. However, I have found that some people react adversely to me speaking my primary language. These are not continuous reactions of a high degree, but there have been enough small instances to mark me.\u00a0\n\t\t\t\tMORE ON THIS TOPIC:Students celebrate 40th annual Festival Latinx, honoring Latinx culture on campusLa Casa Latina celebrates 2023 Latinx Heritage Month at PennOn various occasions, I have had Latinx friends say, \u201cLet\u2019s speak English so X person doesn\u2019t feel excluded,\u201d or even resort to English for \u201cconvenience\u201d when we\u2019re alone. For the former, I understand the sentiment. I wouldn\u2019t want someone to be excluded from a conversation in such a way. However, when I\u2019m naturally speaking Spanish, having my speech interpreted as a personal offense is off-putting.\u00a0\nIn one instance, I met a student through a mutual friend on a night out. This friend and I speak fluent Spanish; the person I had just met did not. Throughout the night, I had various conversations with my new acquaintance \u2014 who I found quite amicable \u2014 and my friend. I would naturally speak Spanish with the latter, not thinking much of it. The next morning, my friend told me how the new acquaintance felt I hated them for speaking Spanish in front of them, knowing they didn\u2019t speak the language.\u00a0\n\tI was shocked by the assumption and, in all honesty, a little offended. I found it quite conceited that one would think another person is speaking in their first language to actively exclude them. Speaking in a first language, for me, is purely a relief issue. Although I am fluent in English, after an entire week of speaking it, it can be extremely draining; thus, particularly in a social setting, I don\u2019t want to add to the exhaustion.\u00a0\nIt is more than fine to be curious about what somebody is saying and ask for a translation. However, immediately expressing discomfort upon hearing another language and presuming the other person is talking badly about you is inconsiderate toward them. More often than not, this language switch is for comfort. This was the first of sufficient instances that exposed a pattern in my time at Penn. In another class, I grew close to a few other Spanish-speaking students. One of them continuously suggested we switch back to English for seemingly no valid reason and would reply to any comment of mine in English.\u00a0\nThis harsh reality on campus expands into the club scene. In one instance, a native English speaker attended a club meeting primarily led in Spanish. Within this meeting, if club members asked questions in Spanish, any other members who answered quickly switched to English. Evidently, the intent is to have everybody be able to partake in conversation. However, members within a Spanish-led group should be able to detach from English formalities within club meetings, particularly if the club seeks to embrace Latinx heritage.\u00a0\nSpeaking in my primary language is the greatest manifestation of my culture, particularly since Spanish accents are so diverse throughout Latin America. Having to switch to English not only in academic settings but in seemingly every other sphere of Penn life further disconnects me from the culture I\u2019ve been surrounded by my entire life until now. This applies to any person whose main language isn\u2019t English, not only to Spanish speakers.\u00a0\n\t\tGet our newsletter, DP Daybreak, delivered to your inbox every weekday morning.Penn has students from over 100 countries, with around 19% of the student body being international. If one truly wants to immerse themselves in Penn\u2019s multilingual community, one needs to recognize that a language barrier works both ways. Just as an English speaker may be tired from learning another language, a non-English speaker can be drained from constantly speaking English. It\u2019s crucial to recognize that for the latter, multilingualism surpasses a simple language requirement and spills over to nearly every sector of their life at Penn.\u00a0\nLanguage fatigue is a true reality, especially for individuals who haven\u2019t learned English from a young age. Thus, if somebody within your social group is speaking their first language, which you are not fluent in, it does not give you the right to feel offended or urge them to speak in a tongue you understand. And, if you are a non-native English speaker, as much as you can, \"habla en tu primer idioma y que los dem\u00e1s se ubiquen.\"\nBEATRIZ B\u00c1EZ is a College first year studying mathematics and political science from San Juan, Puerto Rico.

And, if white is a moral choice, there is an enormous challenge: then you're challenging an entire civilization,\u201d said James Baldwin.\nWhiteness is the myth we\u2019ve been sold and under which we live. In our instruction at the University of Pennsylvania, we were told to reach for safety and to secure our decadence. So are the students now, but they are not nearly as certain that this is the road they\u2019d really like to walk. The students I knew have already paid that price for that ticket, and their horizons, on a human level, look bleak.\u00a0\n\t\tPhiladelphia is not a college town. It is a real city, a Black city, a poor city whose reality reflects the depth of the American crisis and yet contains the possibilities of its salvation. From the soil of this city rose heroes like Teddy Pendergrass, The Delfonics, McCoy Tyner, and Alfie Pollitt. A friend, then a nursing student who had packed her bags for New York City after graduation and returned a few years later to work in the hospitals, remarked on her return, \"Philadelphia has soul.\"\u00a0\nIn the five years since I\u2019ve graduated, the tone of campus has shifted. Students are developing a new language in order to deal with existential questions: What is the purpose of education and the responsibility of students in the wake of war? More than in my time, it is now clear that we, the students, want to be free. The crisis is deepening, and history is accelerating.\n\t\t\n\t\nFewer illusions are possible for the young mind in Philadelphia, which tempers and sharpens it like metal on metal. What the path to whiteness and an invented safety then produces is a delusional and unfree state. My peers, who are banking, coding, and consulting their lives away, are living as prisoners to the choices they\u2019ve made.\u00a0\nAll the beauty, genius, and potential I witnessed when we were young together, freshman year before the vicious teeth of Penn successfully \u201csocialized\u201d most of us, has been wasted, whittled down into dust, and lost. My old friends might have money, but they didn\u2019t manage to save their souls, and some part of them knows this fact \u2014 that they are perishing. We were never meant to become the fools and tools of the mythic America: the one that is superior, war-hungry, greedy, and hypocritical. These choices did their damage. That was an aberration. Now, we are entering a time of correction.\u00a0\n\tWe want to know the meaning of our lives when we live in a country whose hand assassinates a man and poet as beautiful and courageous as Refaat Alareer, when we live in a society in which Aaron Bushnell had to die so that humanity could live. When the youngest students of Philadelphia stand to say they are no different from the children of Palestine, that the bombs dropped abroad also explode in our neighborhoods, we then know it is true for ourselves \u2014 that we bleed the same as these children in Palestine, as all the men and women we encounter in Philadelphia.\u00a0\nOur bondage to the genocide in Gaza is through the struggle to become moral human beings in America, and to relinquish our country from the myths that strangle us and our people.\u00a0\nIt is unmistakable that the education Penn offers is bankrupt, and that some cancer, invisible but detectable, poisons our relationships to each other and to ourselves. The scramble for acceptance into mediocre clubs and fraternities is insufferable, and the false authority these groups stand on in order to make these judgments is embarrassing.

To investigate and challenge the standards of their education, peers, and professors. And to then act and live by these new definitions, through which we will discover freedom. The world makes us, and we make it, too.\u00a0\nIf we were meant to become the leaders of this country and makers of history, as so many of us have been told from youth into maturity \u2014 that we are capable of this \u2014 then this is our role to fulfill: a brave, original, and purposeful life that skirts the frontier of new standards for this nation.

          "title": "Hanadi Abdulkadir | How poor dining hall food shapes our mental and academic capabilities",
          "article_content": "At this point, many Penn students have lived the terrible dining stories at a number of halls across campus. While it\u2019s important to discuss the health and sanitary risks associated with some of these concerns, it\u2019s also necessary to break down how this problem factors into students\u2019 academic and mental well-being.\u00a0\nOpening Sidechat every few days to see yet another picture of undercooked meat or hearing horror stories from my friends dissuades me from trekking across campus to eat at many of our dining halls. Oftentimes, I find myself skipping meals or stretching the time out between each one \u2014 until I accept the fact that I\u2019ll be eating the same food I already ate a couple times that week. Does this mean that I\u2019m probably missing out on some of the necessary vitamins or fiber I should be getting daily? Probably.\n\t\tNumerous Penn Dining Wellness emails live in our inboxes with tips on improving digestive health and practicing better healthy habits in our daily lives. Additionally, the official page for Penn Dining boasts awards and recognitions for sustainability and top college dining. However, the pristine and glossy promotional pictures of sandwiches, smoothies, and breakfast bowls tell a completely different story from the reality on campus.\nWith two of the most historical repeat offenders \u2014 Hill House and 1920 Commons \u2014 being the only consistent options available for on campus dining during the weekend, it\u2019s much more convenient to resort to the other retail spots scattered around campus. However, some of these locations are far apart, depending on where you live, and can add additional costs to weekly expenses. \u00a0\n\t\t\t\tSEE MORE FROM HANADI ABDULKADIR:\ufeffPenn should require an African American history courseWhy social media and Palestinian activism goes hand in handAdditionally, for students who are dishing out a hefty sum of money to enroll in the dining plan, going out of their way to seek expensive alternatives takes away money that could\u2019ve been better spent elsewhere. Considering that first years and sophomores are required to pick a dining plan for their first two years at Penn, it\u2019s no wonder that students have consistently called for the food standards to match the high prices of these meal swipes. Ideally, no student should feel like they need to resort to options outside of Penn; rather, outside options should be supplemental to an already quality level of options at all dining halls.\u00a0\nSince coming to Penn, my relationship with food has become much more complex. I need to look twice when picking out a seemingly clean utensil to eat whatever is on my plate or stare extra hard at my salad with suspicion before consuming it. But growing up, food was always a way for me to connect with my family and friends, to bring us back together even when we hadn\u2019t seen each other in a long time. Yet the food at Penn, at its worst, has left me frustrated and succeeded at suppressing my appetite \u2014 something I actually can relate to other students about.\n\tAlthough certain foods are scientifically linked to improving mental clarity and focus, I hesitate in reaching for those vegetables because they don\u2019t look as fresh or appetizing when lined up on display in Kings Court English House. As a result, I look for short-term solutions in coffee, which leaves me feeling tired earlier in the day or exhausted while trying to tackle my assignments at night. In order to meet my immediate deadlines, I prioritize some assignments over others, meaning some classes suffer in academic performance and perpetuate an almost never-ending cycle of playing catch-up. I believe that the root cause of all these problems can be traced back to the lack of decent dining.\u00a0\nThis same sentiment has been echoed by many of my friends and peers. But the dining quality at Penn can be mitigated if the University addresses the root problem. Whether that be promoting clean and sanitary workspaces when handling food or streamlining student complaints to Penn Dining other than through email, the University can restore student faith in the system. When it comes to campus dining, Penn can improve upon our experiences by implementing the changes that students deserve to enjoy, especially at the height of midterm season.\nHANADI ABDULKADIR is a College sophomore studying international relations from Philadelphia.

          "article_content": "During Penn\u2019s recent administrative upheaval, the University community found an unexpected silver lining: For the first time, Penn was making headlines alongside Harvard and MIT.\u00a0\nThe presidents of these three institutions were at the center of an infamous congressional hearing in December after their alleged missteps on campus antisemitism. I\u2019ll admit, there is something far more distasteful about chaos at the Capitol than the collective HYPSM prestige.\n\t\tBut many of us are taking our education at Penn for granted, shedding our \u201cque ser\u00e1, ser\u00e1\u201d optimism, and wondering at times what it would be like to go to a more recognizable Ivy. For decades, we\u2019ve all but exhausted our morale by clarifying to passersby that no, Penn State and Penn are not the same university. And yes, Penn is actually active in areas outside of Wharton\u2019s finance programs.\nSo, when Penn Engineering announced its new undergraduate program in artificial intelligence, many of us were enthusiastic about the University\u2019s growing role in the innovation sector: a space thought to be dominated by less business-oriented institutions.\n\t\t\t\tSEE MORE FROM MRITIKA SENTHIL: Removing legacy admissions will align Penn\u2019s actions more closely with its educational missionWhy changing leadership won\u2019t eliminate antisemitism at PennBut Penn\u2019s realization, of possibly its most practical initiative, begs the question: Is the University actually necessary in DevOps? Does sitting in a classroom \u2014 let alone one that\u2019s in the midst of a campus known for its influx of finance bros \u2014 really supersede what can be MacGyvered by a tech junkie with only a laptop, caffeine, and time? I want to give a definite \u201cno.\u201d Otherwise, I would need to hold my classmates and myself accountable for upholding all the exclusivity that comes with attending Penn. And yet, there are a frustrating number of anonymous netizens, D-list journalists, and LinkedIn bards who call Ivy League universities like Penn \u201cout of touch\u201d \u2014 remnants of centuries-old American elitism in an era of bottom-up grassroots movements.\nOne C-suite executive anticipates that \u201cthe best AI engineers and builders won\u2019t graduate Penn Engineering. They'll be global, builders and in the right group chats.\u201d His readers agree, with one commenter further emphasizing that \u201cuniversities cannot keep up with the pace of free market innovation.\u201d When these schools attempt to go against the grain and align with consumer needs, \u201cit genuinely looks embarrassing and out of date.\u201d\n\tIn an environment where the use of AI models is largely democratized, we\u2019re naturally drawn to the trope of a layperson who forgoes bureaucratic systems to channel their intelligence: creating life-changing inventions that would have never come to be under self-serving corporate and political influences. And when ignoring cases of succor \u2014 as mainstream media unfortunately does \u2014 there are many examples of such successes. Bill Gates and Paul Allen, co-founders of Microsoft, were university dropouts. So were Meta Platforms co-founders Mark Zuckerberg and Dustin Moskovitz. As Penn\u2019s over reliance on donors came to light earlier this school year, critics of the upper crust have continued to group Penn with other perpetrators of social stratification. The field of AI is, by nature, continuously evolving. And limiting growth in the discipline to those who can afford, and then succeed in Penn\u2019s Department of Computer and Information Science courses is counterproductive.\nHowever, these narratives misrepresent the intentions of Penn\u2019s AI program.\nTo make a better case for Penn\u2019s AI major, I spoke with Robert Ghrist, Andrea Mitchell Professor and associate dean for undergraduate education at Penn Engineering. He describes how the process of integrating AI in education is similar to the effects of increasing access to music recording and playback technologies. Now, there is \u201cmore music for everyone at much lower prices,\u201d he told me. Nonetheless, \u201cartists at the very top of the industry\u201d are increasingly the benefactors of \u201ca concentration of rewards.\u201d Taylor Swift is, as any current news feed can attest to, perhaps the most prolific embodiment of such phenomena. And professor Ghrist strives to make Penn an incubator of sorts for the \u201cTaylor Swifts of AI\u201d that seek avenues for academic growth, to actually be the \u201cleading edge where the best thrive.\u201d\nAnd to thrive in this discipline, aspiring AI mavens are off course by simply memorizing browser instructions in JavaScript and praying for a tech equivalent of the coveted Goldman Sachs internship. After all, studying AI is a philosophical pursuit: an inquiry into the nature of consciousness and ethics of creating sentient machines. It\u2019s also a political pursuit, for AI poses challenges in regulatory compliance. There are countless possible liabilities for even the most basic ChatGPT input, such as unprotected user data and violations of intellectual property rights. \u00a0\n\t\tGet our newsletter, DP Daybreak, delivered to your inbox every weekday morning.Needless to say, as you might have noticed in my earlier columns, I am not an AI major. I\u2019m not even enrolled in Penn Engineering. Am I, of all students, in the right to quash critics of the Penn AI major when I dropped AP Computer Science in high school (with no regrets)?\nYet, it\u2019s clearly irresponsible to follow the well-intentioned advice from tech capitalists when constant innovation is not particularly ideal for society. Maybe I\u2019m just afraid of a \"Black Mirror\"-esque dystopia, but there is a kind of ominous quality to the idea of highly skilled AI scientists off the reins. Penn, however, is cultivating an ecosystem that nurtures AI talent, albeit not by stifling the next Elon Musk or Sam Altman with red-tape-ridden academics; instead, Penn fosters ethically conscious innovation that addresses complex societal challenges. And so, the fact that I can engage with the Penn curricula across departments has a surprising beauty. The opportunity to become a part of this technological movement \u2014 or, dare I say, revolution \u2014 is the gift of studying AI at Penn.\nMRITIKA SENTHIL is a first year studying management and Russian and east European studies from Columbia, S.C.

From frequent announcements regarding policies within classrooms to endless professors and visiting scholars weighing in on the unprecedented effect large language models will have on our lives, I\u2019m sure we\u2019ve all discussed to death how revolutionary ChatGPT has become for college students.\u00a0\nMany of us have even had the chance to firmly establish positions on whether the University should embrace the technology wholeheartedly or put in place safeguards to prevent it from eroding the value of a college education, but up until now, the vast majority of conversations have been on a non-technical level.\n\t\tThat all potentially changed in this past month when Penn announced their first Bachelor of Science in Engineering in AI. Thankfully for us, Penn has chosen to launch this interdisciplinary degree at the \u201coptimal time\u201d to \u201ccreate a society where AI isn\u2019t just a tool, but a fundamental force for good to advance society.\u201d But at what cost? To what extent should we be using college as an opportunity to hyperfocus on not just a certain field (computer science), but a field within a field? Majoring in AI panders to the pre-professionalism Penn is known for and removes many of the foundational elements of the field that underlie innovation.\u00a0\nIn an interesting recent LinkedIn post, David Magerman pondered the implications of a university building complete undergraduate curriculums around a \u201cmodern business tool that is a niche application of computer science, diverting students away from a broad education in computer science.\u201d He went on to ask pointedly, \u201cWhat's next?

A Wharton BS in Quantitative Trading?\u201d\n\t\t\t\tSEE MORE FROM AKIVA BERKOWITZ:The newsletter is dead\ufeffIsrael under attack: What do you stand for?As a current computer science major, I\u2019ll admit the AI curriculum looks fascinating. There is such an array of eye-catching electives (from Deep Generative Models to Natural Language Processing) that, if I were doing my degree all over again, I suspect I would have been swayed to switch into the major. But as a recently graduated computer and information science friend put it, the degree \u201cseems like the cool parts of CIS\u201d without the heavier basics like operating systems, computer systems, and physics \u2014 building blocks on the entire computer domain. \u00a0\nThe question I ask myself is whether artificial intelligence is really enough of an independent field that it transcends computer science and necessitates its own major. Is the relatively new field of AI established enough, broad enough, and unique enough such that the skills we gain through taking just those mostly career-focused courses today will undoubtedly remain relevant in 30 years and justify the $84,600 a year sticker price? I simply wonder how likely it may be that AI will become so unrecognizable in 20 or even 10 years, given its breakneck pace of innovation, that students may have wished that their majors in college focused on more fundamental elements of the field that innovators keep turning back to for insight.\u00a0\n\tAside from long-term career effectiveness an AI degree would have compared to computer science or electrical engineering, Penn is known for its pre-professional student body, and this new major shows signs of that sentiment leaking into the curriculum as well. In contrast to the Penn Integrates Knowledge professorships that bring in academic leaders who deeply understand multiple fields to better spark insight between them, this new major filters various courses of study to pluck out the elements we find valuable today.\u00a0\nIn this line of thinking, maybe we should consider the true value of a groundbreaking Wharton degree in quant trading that would promise to \u201csculpt the financial moguls of tomorrow\u201d with unparalleled prowess in algorithmic trading strategies and quantitative analysis.\u00a0\nAll this is to say, I immediately understand the value the current AI concentration within the larger CIS curriculum has. And I appreciate the Ph.D. programs that take students to a higher level of understanding, once they\u2019ve taken the time in their undergraduate training to build the broad foundations. I simply remain curious of the true value an AI undergraduate degree offers us as students over other forms of study within the field and the certain level of indulgence in pre-professionalism that it plays into on Penn\u2019s campus. I truly hope that I\u2019m proven wrong.\nAKIVA BERKOWITZ is an Engineering junior studying computer science from Silver Spring, Md.

          "title": "Eric Najera | Penn must take action to enhance the dining experience",
          "article_content": "As busy college students, most of us do not have time to cook our own meals, and if you are anything like me, cooking is far from your forte. The hassle of having to go to the grocery store, cook, and clean can be time consuming and even more difficult when you\u2019re overwhelmed with classes, clubs, and homework. For the many students without access to a kitchen in their dorm, this presents an even bigger challenge. Luckily, college campuses have dining halls! Students simply swipe their card to get access to an all-you-care-to-eat dining experience. Dining halls provide easy access meals to students\u2014but what happens when that food is inedible?\nAs a picky eater, I know that simply because I do not like a dish does not mean it is unsafe to eat, but food with cockroaches and glass is unsafe for anyone. A seemingly obvious underlying assumption in dining is that food is safe to eat. College dining halls should be a place where students go to eat well-cooked, hairless, and insect-free food. However, that is not the case at Penn: There is a lack of responsibility to make sure the food is meeting basic standards for, let alone satisfying, all students.\u00a0\n\t\tMeal plans are far from cheap. For the sticker price, students would expect quality food, but they would be wrong. Both of the first-year student meal plan options cost $6,330, with the maximum amount of swipes being 296. Each meal swipe equates to roughly $17, which is about the same price as a Caniac Combo at Raising Cane's. As previously stated, Penn dining hall food is far from gourmet, and its price is too high for the quality delivered.\u00a0\nExpensive dining plan meals are not unique to Penn, but other Ivy League schools have similar prices for better quality food. Cornell University offers an unlimited meal plan, so students may visit the dining halls as much as they want with a fixed cost of $6,942 for food ranked second-best in the nation. So, for roughly 600 more dollars, Cornell students have access to unlimited meals and substantially better quality dining.\u00a0\n\t\t\t\tSEE MORE FROM ERIC NAJERA: \ufeffWe should be grateful to attend PennPenn clubs should have an assigned faculty member\ufeffAside from price and quality, weekend dining is another struggle. With the popular McClelland Sushi & Market and Houston Market being closed on Saturdays and the other dining halls closing at 8 p.m., food options are limited. Late-night study sessions means having to resort to local food places that remain open, and unlike nearby schools such as Drexel, our dining dollars do not work at off-campus restaurants and out-of-pocket money spent on takeout can add up quickly.\nBefore every school break, Sidechat is flooded with posts of excitement for home-cooked meals. In my classes, when asked what we are excited for, most students reply being able to eat good food. It is not uncommon for college students to miss their home-cooked meals, but when students are excited to actually eat food that is not served alongside insects, it signifies a problem.\n\tWith Penn\u2019s Bon App\u00e9tit contract still in place, we may not know how much Penn can do to change the dining experience. Safe, clean food should not be an unreasonable expectation. In order to enhance a student's experience outside the classroom, Penn must budget for an edible food experience for all students.\nERIC NAJERA is a College sophomore studying history from Rolling Meadows, Ill.

          "title": "Zaid Alsubaiei | Does Penn\u2019s diversity represent its sense of community?",
          "article_content": "We all know the typical \u201ctypes\u201d of high schoolers, the different clich\u00e9s: Where are my nerds at? But, another attribute of student groups that has become increasingly relevant in the 21st century United States is the diverse ethnic makeup of its population. And, frankly, do we as a campus mirror all that comes with that national trend of diversity?\nThink of the friends with whom you often hang out. Then, ask those friends with whom they usually go out. Finally, think of the groups you are a part of, the extracurriculars in which you partake. Notice a pattern?\n\t\t\u201c[D]espite increased opportunity to live and work in mixed-race settings, Americans remain racially segregated in their friendship patterns,\u201d a study published by the National Institutes of Health found. \u201cSpatial racism, cultural encapsulation, and personal choice are contributing factors for patterns of same-race friendships.\u201d\u00a0\nThis pattern seems to reflect the divisions present in Penn\u2019s social scene as well. Despite coming from all sorts of backgrounds across the world, the University\u2019s students appear to have unconsciously adopted a policy of self segregation. In other words, we like to \u201cstick to our own\u201d by socializing with others to whom we relate to on a cultural, ethnic, or religious basis. So, regardless of Penn\u2019s efforts to integrate people of differing experiences and beliefs, there still remains a degree of resistance by individuals themselves to cross those racial or cultural lines.\n\t\t\n\t\nAs a result, the potential for diversity of thought is threatened. A narrow mindset develops within these groups that students pledge to, and they effectively act as echo chambers that exacerbate already crippling political polarization. We relate to each other less, rely on our \u201cown\u201d more, and become less tolerant of the views, and thus experiences, of those who do not necessarily look, think, or speak like us.\nThis kind of thinking \u2014 whether manifested in the form of race, religion, or otherwise \u2014 has led to serious tension at times and enabled a distorted view of certain communities and how they experience Penn. I attribute part of that thinking not to the identity groups we are a part of, but to how much we value them over who we are as individuals.\n\tHomogenous communities definitely have their place in the college experience: They help ease our transition when we first arrive at Penn, and their role cannot be replaced. I say this as an international student myself, who had a hard time acclimating to an entirely different culture and, most radically, diet. Nonetheless, we should treat these organizations as an aid to finding belonging on campus, not a substitute for individual thought and expression.\nHowever, none of this means individuals can\u2019t agree or always need to separate themselves from the group. The use of a large, collective voice can benefit our campus much more than we realize. What is important to note is that there lies a clear distinction between acknowledging the views of others and forcing ourselves to accept those views for the sake of conformity.\nThere is nothing wrong with disagreeing with the majority, whether it is one against two or one against a nation (though some may try to tell you otherwise). As long as you are respectful and driven by a desire to learn rather than defend, there are no limits on what perspective you may question. So, challenge your beliefs, reevaluate your viewpoint, challenge that of others (no matter who they are), and then reevaluate yourself again. It\u2019ll be hard at first, to express your precise, genuine thoughts without fear. But, remember that you\u2019re not alone (I struggle sometimes myself) and that it\u2019s a process you won\u2019t always get right.\n\t\tGet our newsletter, DP Daybreak, delivered to your inbox every weekday morning.The hardest part of breaking out of groupthink, after realizing it, is talking about it. My advice? Take the plunge and never look back. The next time you are in a group and the majority agrees with an idea you don\u2019t like, let it be known. Talk about it and explain why you think the way you do. Don\u2019t worry if some get offended or others simply do not agree; it is normal and, in fact, expected.\u00a0\nNever forget that disputes you engage in are an opportunity, not a challenge, and our differences are enlightening, not threatening. Only then will we begin to understand and appreciate each other more as unique actors in a truly historic community.\nZAID ALSUBAIEI is a College first year studying economics from Al-Khobar, Saudi Arabia.

          "title": "Eliza Carroll | You are what you read: Sidechat\u2019s impact on campus",
          "article_content": "I downloaded Sidechat this fall after my friends sent me too many screenshots of funny memes or jokes posted on the anonymous app. I figured that doing so would simply remove the middleman. I was already being exposed to the same jokes, memes, comments and judgements as those on the app anyway \u2026 right?\u00a0\nIn December, I returned home for reading days and fell into an easy pattern of studying. Nothing I did was wildly exciting or social, but I instead found myself enjoying the routine and satisfaction of productivity. During my study breaks, I would scroll on Sidechat \u2014 and from the comfort of my home, I felt myself spiraling into anxious dread about returning to Penn. Each time I opened the app, I was faced with a barrage of posts all echoing the same sentiment: Penn is awful and depressing. Without a second thought, I accepted those posts as fact, and in doing so, I allowed Sidechat to have more power than it deserves. In other words, I subscribed to the complaining culture that is pervasive on Sidechat.\u00a0\n\t\tUsing Sidechat, especially without intentional thought, is a way of looking at Penn through hypercritical glasses. Perhaps this is because negativity has been normalized and cynicism gets more upvotes. To some extent, this pessimistic messaging is diluted with the insertion of mildly entertaining memes or jokes, but the result is still the same. With each scroll, Sidechat is perpetuating a defeatist perspective of Penn.\u00a0\nSo, I arrived back at Penn to take my final exam: openly unhappy about returning to what I thought would be a bleak campus as a result of discourse on Sidechat. But to my surprise, it was not horrific, and I was able to enjoy my weekend of studying just as I had my week at home. The sheer volume of disheartening posts on Sidechat had clouded my perspective and ability to see the best in the situation. Sure, I was becoming one with a Huntsman GSR while others were at home enjoying break, but on the other hand, I was with my friends and able to have a sleepy campus all to myself.\n\t\t\t\tAs is the case with most other social media platforms, Sidechat is consumed passively and without a second thought \u2014 it\u2019s used to pass time, curb boredom, and satiate our addictions to our phones. And yet, students are absorbing and internalizing content more quickly than they can truly digest it.\u00a0\nGiven the bandwagon culture on Sidechat, users often build off of one another, creating a chaotic, and often dismal, echo chamber that does not truly represent life at Penn. Whether or not college is the best four years of your life, it is at least what you make of it, and Sidechat enables students to feel like victims of an unknown cause. For those who are actually struggling, Sidechat acts not as a productive outlet, but rather as a meta ether that provides no remedy other than the satisfaction that others are unhappy too.\u00a0\n\tSince winter break, I have in fact deleted Sidechat and am all the better for it. I still get sent the best and the brightest jokes by my friends, but I am no longer overwhelmed by unsolicited complaints on an hourly basis. Without Sidechat, my thoughts on the housing lottery, the floods in the Quad, and upcoming midterms are completely my own. Deleting Sidechat may not be for everyone, but it\u2019s imperative for those who chose to use Sidechat to take a more critical view of what is being circulated and evaluate whether or not they are benefiting from it. It may just change the way they see Penn.\u00a0\nELIZA CARROLL is a College first year studying international relations and art history from Greenwich, Conn.

          "title": "Cathy Li and Liala Sofi | History can\u2019t repeat itself; stand with Chinatown",
          "article_content": "Students for the Preservation of Chinatown protested outside the Board of Trustees meeting held at the Inn at Penn on Mar. 3, 2023. \nA few weeks ago, the streets of Chinatown came to life with firecrackers and lion dances ringing in the year of the dragon. As you walk through the brightly colored 40-foot paifang \u2014 known to most as Chinatown\u2019s Friendship Gate \u2014 you enter into a cultural oasis that has stood strong in the heart of Philadelphia for nearly 150 years. Beyond this fixture, Chinatown serves as a home to nearly 3,000 residents and numerous family-owned businesses, restaurants, shops, and community organizations. Whether you are going to Ken\u2019s Seafood Restaurant for a fun night out or Heng Fa for groceries, Chinatown feels like home.\u00a0\nUnfortunately, this community has been under constant attack for decades and is once again facing the threat of displacement and gentrification from a plan to develop an arena for the Philadelphia 76ers merely a block away. We firmly stand with the Students for the Preservation of Chinatown and urge you to do the same. \u00a0\n\t\tSince the early 1900s, Chinatown has been a victim of gentrification often driven by predatory infrastructure projects. In 1932, the construction of subway infrastructure at Ridge and Eighth streets \u2014 and the subsequent development of the Vine Street Expressway from 1957 to 1991 \u2014 resulted in the destruction of buildings and severe divisions within the community. Bringing in noise and pollution, the expressway eroded neighborhoods and people's quality of life. This was not Chinatown's sole battle, however, as it also faced multiple proposals of developments for a federal prison in 1992, a baseball stadium in 2000, and a casino in 2008.\u00a0\nThe story of Philadelphia's Chinatown mirrors other Chinatowns across the nation. Amid the 1994 fiscal crisis in Washington, D.C., then-Washington Wizards owner Abe Pollin negotiated a deal for the downtown Capital One Arena, where the city covered pre-development costs to acquire and demolish properties. Entrepreneurs in Washington's Chinatown voiced concerns about prices of real estate skyrocketing and parking impacts on businesses in the area. A decade later, most Chinese residents were forced to move out due to unaffordable housing. The parking shortage led to the closure of the last Chinese grocery store, accelerating the decline of the Chinese American population in the area to fewer than 400 residents today. Ironically, as D.C.\u2019s arena now relocates to the suburbs, the community is left behind, having endured irreversible destruction while in the midst of its recovery from the pandemic.\u00a0\n\t\t\t\tMORE FROM LIALA SOFI AND CATHY LI:Liala Sofi | The hypocrisy of billionaire philanthropistsCathy Li | Philadelphia\u2019s changing tastesIn New York\u2019s Chinatown, threats of displacement and economic insecurity also loom high. In 2021, the Museum of Chinese in America accepted a donation of $35 million in support of a borough-based jail complex which would displace Chinese American working-class people in the area. On top of that, its board executives were connected to the closing of the last unionized restaurant, beloved Jing Fong banquet hall, and construction of luxury towers that are actively raising rent and real estate taxes in the area.\nIn Philadelphia, the current 76Place project is being developed by 76 DevCo, an initiative by 76ers managing partners Josh Harris, David Blitzer, and David Adelman. Adelman is at the forefront of the construction of the arena and has promised not to displace the residents or businesses in Chinatown, but his past actions speak louder than his current words. Adelman works closely with Brett Altman, who also owns the University City Townhomes, and was a key figure behind the demolition and end of affordable housing in the West Philadelphia area that was previously known as the \"Black Bottom.\u201d This constant cycle of displacing residents and communities that have lived in the area for generations must end, and we must be the voice to make this happen.\n\tDevelopers of the project have stated that the arena will \u201cserve as a model for an equitable & inclusive community,\u201d yet there is not a single mention of Chinatown in the proposal. Efforts to ensure communities can benefit from this project read as empty promises when nearly 95% of residents, business owners, and visitors oppose the arena\u2019s construction.\nMany questions posed by residents have also gone unanswered by 76 DevCo. How will restaurants and small businesses in the surrounding area be protected? Who will clean the streets after huge events?\u00a0\nPreserving Philadelphia's architectural heritage demands careful consideration in urban development, but the development of the arena does the exact opposite \u2014 jeopardizing accessible low-income and senior housing complexes, healthcare clinics, and schools for children.\nPenn has direct ties to the developers in the area, and students should be cognizant of the situation. Adelman currently sits on Penn Medicine Board of Trustees and is the CEO of Campus Apartments, which houses many Penn students off-campus. But more importantly, Penn students are directly and indirectly involved in the Chinatown community, whether that be Penn Lions performing all throughout the city for Lunar New Year, or student groups like SPOC organizing initiatives to honor traditions celebrating the multi-ethnic communities that reside there.\u00a0\nDespite what greedy developers may suggest, Chinatown is not an ethnic theme park but a home. It\u2019s more than just a place to eat, it\u2019s a support network and a cultural hub for immigrants and visitors alike.\nIn the face of ongoing threats, Chinatown has demonstrated remarkable resilience and activism, advocating for the needs of all diverse communities of color that are integrated into the cultural fabric of our city. The next time you are in Chinatown, take a look around at all the place has to offer. Venture into Ebisu for some home decor and enjoy a Mochinut donut as you shop. Come by Dae Bak for soul-nourishing Korean barbecue. The opportunities to support your favorite restaurants and local businesses are endless.\nPlease don't turn a blind eye to what is happening outside the Penn bubble. Pay attention to what SPOC and other organizers are doing in the fight for the preservation of Chinatown. Educate yourself on what is going on in Chinatowns across the country. If you can, participate in programming like Crane Chinatown Community Center art exhibitions or Show Your Love for Chinatown events to learn more about the challenges facing the neighborhood. Sign petitions. \u00a0\nAdorned with dragon motifs, and gorgeous ornamental roof tiles, the Friendship Archway is not only an architectural masterpiece, but a labor of love \u2014\u00a0created for community by community. The engineers and artisans from Tianjin, China \u2014 Philadelphia\u2019s sister city \u2014 came together with residents and the city of Philadelphia to fund and invest in Chinatown, and you should too.\u00a0\nThe next time you walk through the gate, remember that the fight for Philadelphia\u2019s Chinatown, and Chinatowns everywhere, is not over.

          "title": "Caroline Magdolen | \u201cEveryone cheats.\u201d What can we do about it?",
          "article_content": "My guess is that nearly everyone reading this article knows someone who has been academically disingenuous, or been that someone before. Being academically dishonest isn\u2019t all about flashy examples, like the two admitted Penn students accused of plagiarism and fabricating data in 2022. There are smaller violations that may feel less egregious, or even harmless, like querying ChatGPT for help completing your homework, peeking at a friend\u2019s lab assignment, or answering a PollEverywhere as if you\u2019re in class, when really, you\u2019re snoozing in your dorm.\nAcademic dishonesty is having a moment in the spotlight. The advent of generative AI, the use of which cannot be reliably detected by grading softwares, will likely upend student learning for better or worse. At the same time, examples of plagiarism by prominent academics are being dug up left and right. The former president of Harvard, Claudine Gay, was ousted in part due to plagiarism concerns, and Business Insider found that former MIT professor Neri Oxman (the wife of billionaire Bill Ackman, who led the campaign against Gay) \u201cstole sentences and whole paragraphs from Wikipedia, other scholars and technical documents in her academic writing.\u201d\n\t\tTo be clear, I believe that academic dishonesty at Penn \u2014 going against community standards that your professor has explicitly outlined \u2014 is unacceptable, and that we should be doing more to penalize and prevent it.\nNevertheless, we must also acknowledge that academic dishonesty is understandable, in that we can piece together students\u2019 rationales when they do cheat, and even sympathize with them in some cases.\n\t\t\t\tSEE MORE FROM CAROLINE MAGDOLEN:\ufeffThe Rat Kings of PennThere\u2019s no better time for climate education\ufeffTo dissuade academic dishonesty, we employ sayings like, \u201cIt will only hurt you in the long run to cheat,\u201d or \u201cYou\u2019re taking advantage of other students who've completed their work fairly.\u201d This is true in some circumstances. If you\u2019re an aspiring quant and you\u2019re asking ChatGPT to calculate all of the derivatives on your MATH 1400 homework, it\u2019s going to show: First in your exams for the class, then in every math class you take thereafter, and especially in your future career. And if MATH 1400 is curved, your dishonest success capitalizes on the honest failures of others \u2014 not cool.\nBut this is not true in all cases. Jane* was a first year in her spring term when she was taking CIS 1210: Data Structures and Algorithms \u2014 a famously challenging CIS course \u2014 with Rajiv Gandhi, a famously challenging professor.\u00a0\n\tShe cheated on her coding assignment late into the semester, and as per the professor\u2019s policy, received a -300/100 on the submitted homework and zeros on all previously submitted homework, receiving a D as her final grade in the course.\nBut Jane believes that what is more important to her story is not what happened, but why it happened.\u00a0\n\u201cWhat drove me to make a bad decision? Why are [these classes] so infamous? It\u2019s because of notorious policies where you cannot collaborate on many assignments. You are given long problem sets to do, on your own, each week, with desperate students in office hour queues that are two to four hours long. Many times, you will go to the TA and not get a clear answer. It is a profoundly isolating situation, particularly for freshmen just entering college, and that\u2019s what drives well-meaning people to cheat.\u201d\nBased on my conversation with Jane, it seemed that she felt isolated at the time and was struggling to reach out for the support that she needed, both in CIS 1210 and at Penn as a whole. And given the limited support Jane could receive from TAs and her instructor, backtracking her friend\u2019s code felt more conducive to her learning than doing nothing.\nJane expressed a lot of remorse over what happened, and said that she still has a lot of respect for Rajiv, maintaining a good relationship with him to this day. She was also grateful that Rajiv was willing to handle this internally, since a low grade in the class looks better than a formal statement on her transcript, detailing her violation of academic integrity.\n\u201cI deserved to be punished harshly,\u201d Jane said. \u201cBut the collaboration policies of these introductory courses, and the punishment I received, wrecked my self-esteem and my early college experience. I felt that there was no way out.\u201d\nAccording to Jane, Rajiv's philosophy is to \"let go of your grades early: the sooner you stop caring about your GPA and start caring about learning, the better.\" She agrees with this philosophy, especially since he curves his courses generously, but sees this as out of touch with the realities of many Penn students.\nAfter students have prioritized perfecting their grades and resumes (and have been praised for it) in high school, those habits won\u2019t get undone overnight. Even at Penn, there are many institutions and accolades that continue to reward \u201cperfect\u201d performance over pursuing difficult academic disciplines, experimenting, and invariably messing up sometimes.\nFrankly, for a pre-med student in computer science (a track which Jane was considering at the time), the adage that \u201ccheating will hurt you in the long run\u201d skill-wise doesn\u2019t hold much water. The skillset of a future doctor and a software engineer just don\u2019t overlap enough. What can hurt a pre-med in the long run is a low GPA.\nAnd while there are some students for whom projects, internships, and technical interviews will get them a lot further in guaranteeing their success, this is not true for everyone. For many preprofessional students who may want to challenge themselves with a major or minor in CIS, they risk getting shut out of the study altogether.\nWhat frustrates me most about this entire situation is not that such harsh action was taken, but that it appears ineffective in tackling the issue at hand. If a student wanted to cheat, they could just take CIS 1600 or CIS 1210 during a different semester, when a different instructor was in charge and penalties were anecdotally known for being less harsh.\nWhile Jane\u2019s actions were clearly wrong, I can\u2019t help thinking that she was just the unlucky example that had to face the music, and she said as much in our interview: \u201cEveryone cheats in this class. You don\u2019t survive [CIS 1600 or CIS 1210] without talking to people, it just depends on whether you get caught. That doesn\u2019t make cheating okay, but it does mean that we need to rethink how these courses operate.\u201d\nSo, what can we do so that not everyone cheats?\nThis is a complex question, and there is no easy answer. It is crucial that as we frame the issue of academic integrity violations, we look at both the violations themselves and the root motivations that drive them \u2014 these actions are not taking place in a vacuum.\u00a0\nAcademic integrity violations these days are, to an extent, simply easier to commit. ChatGPT has led to a surge in \u201cunfair advantage\u201d violations. And even before generative AI, the pandemic had uprooted our usual test-taking environment. Now that classes are in person again, we no longer need to have take-home or open-Internet exams, but these still persist in some classes, and are easier to cheat on. Penn, given its history of fraudulent alumni, isn\u2019t going to be a place where professors can blindly trust students to refrain from cheating when presented with the option, so professors should take some responsibility for leveling the playing field in the classroom too.\u00a0\nJulie Nettleton, the executive director of Penn\u2019s Center for Community Standards and Accountability (CSA), relayed over email that CSA already works closely with schools and centralized resources at Penn to discuss how to proctor exams, and with faculty to discuss exams, syllabi language, and classroom policies.\nWhat constitutes a violation itself is currently not standard across classes, or even across different sections of the same class. How to handle a concern of academic integrity falls to the professor first \u2014 this is how Jane completed CIS 1210 with a lower grade, rather than a formal sanction from the CSA. It makes sense to delegate this responsibility to professors: It is more efficient than having the CSA handle every case, and professors should have the freedom to decide what constitutes cheating in their classrooms.\nHowever, this does open the door to students deliberately choosing sections of a course with professors that have more relaxed academic integrity policies. Conversely, some professors can be overly harsh, to the point where they are acting unfairly towards their students.\u00a0\nJill*, another student that I interviewed for this article, was falsely accused by her professor of collaborating on her final exam with her peers. At the start of winter break, the professor sent a class-wide email imploring those who worked together on the take-home exam to turn themselves in or have the matter escalated. Jill recalls that for students that turned themselves in, the professor lowered their grades accordingly \u2014 everyone else was reported to the CSA.\nIn the end, Jill\u2019s name was cleared, but she was assigned a case manager that seemed to have assumed she was guilty by default. As the case progressed, many of the details that the professor used to build the case against her appeared superfluous \u2014 for example, she and her friends had all rounded to the same decimal place in their work. Jill suspects that the escalation may have been personal: she had previously asked the professor, on behalf of the class, if he could make changes to his teaching style to facilitate learning.\nIt seems wrong to me that a professor could accuse a student and cause such extensive stress when in the end, Jill turned out to be innocent. It reminded me of some other methods that professors use to catch students cheating, such as Turnitin\u2019s flawed AI detector.\nPart of the solution to rampant academic dishonesty may also lie in expanding our vocabulary to discuss the issue, as John McWhorter pointed out in The New York Times. A class-wide cheating ring, direct plagiarism of original ideas from a paper as one\u2019s own, and copying a line of someone\u2019s code all constitute academic dishonesty, but range broadly in terms of severity and \u201cease of catching.\u201d However, this is rarely reflected in academic integrity policies.\u00a0\nIt can be awkward to suggest that some forms of dishonesty are worse than others, and more awkward still to draw the line between different punishments for different violations, but we must still have these conversations.\u00a0\nWhat should constitute dishonesty at all? When speaking with Jane, she would often circle back to how isolating it was to work alone on her assignments as a first year in introductory computer science courses, particularly as a woman in STEM. Every day, she would walk out of class \u201cfeeling way worse about [her]self.\u201d Now exploring chemistry, physics, and biology courses, she greatly appreciates the change in her academic environment, where students are encouraged to openly collaborate. The grade medians in chemistry are similar to those in CIS (which is to say, not great), but Jane is not as stressed as she was in CIS 1210, since she studies with her friends, and they can struggle and ask for help together.\u00a0\nWhile it was dishonest of Jane to copy code when it was against CIS 1210 policy, perhaps CIS majors and minors would learn more from the course if they were in a more collaborative environment to begin with. Jane has suggested that CIS 1210 should find a middle ground where students can learn from each other, but not be overly reliant on collaboration to perform well on exams.\u00a0\nShe also argues that there should be more opportunities for students to admit to academic dishonesty \u2014 through a friend at Stanford, she heard that at the end of a computer science class, students can select the assignments they have cheated on and receive a negative score on them, or risk facing more uncertain penalties if they are later caught.\u00a0\n\u201cThis policy gives people a second chance to do the right thing, and I do believe that you learn from an experience if you own up to it,\u201d Jane said.\nDeliberations over how best to address academic dishonesty can go on without end, but unfortunately this column must do just that. So here, I want to leave you with a reminder of what I said at the beginning: Academic dishonesty is unacceptable, but it is also understandable.\n\t\tGet our newsletter, DP Daybreak, delivered to your inbox every weekday morning.The hard, but necessary, solution to \u201ceveryone cheating\u201d is taking a good look at the stories behind academic dishonesty, and listening to the students involved with sympathy.

          "title": "Jack Lakis | What we can learn from Penn\u2019s college ranking",
          "article_content": "Last fall, a plethora of new results from U.S. News & World Report, Wall Street Journal, and Forbes elevated Penn in their national college rankings. Nearly every list places Penn among the top 10, some going as far as placing the University among the top five. This universal growth resulted from a key change in most of these sources\u2019 metrics: greater consideration given to postgraduate salaries.\nPenn famously has one of the highest-earning alumni bodies in the country. Starting salaries for Penn graduates are often considered the highest in the Ivy League. By mid-career, the average Penn alum is raking in $165,000 annually, while the national average for a college graduate caps out at $74,000.\n\t\tPenn draws a great deal of prestige from its potential to produce high earners, which is a direct result of our school\u2019s preprofessional culture. Nearly 50% of all Penn graduates enter one of two career fields: consulting or finance. This pipeline allows most Penn alumni to matriculate into high-paying jobs shortly after graduation.\nI\u2019m usually a defender of preprofessionalism. It\u2019s crucial that Penn graduates are able to find good jobs, and high salary potential is an immense advantage. But those jobs aren\u2019t everything. Many universities are making gains in rankings and name recognition based on alumni outcomes in public service careers.\n\t\t\t\t\ufeffSEE MORE FROM JACK LAKIS:\ufeffDo we all hate Penn?Staying focused after Magill's resignation\ufeffFor example, Harvard University boasts about its eight presidential alumni. However, when 1968 Wharton graduate Donald Trump was elected president, Penn mostly ignored his history with the school. Given his proximity to controversy and his unconventional political history, Penn\u2019s bump in prestige was limited by Trump\u2019s election. Our second closest claim to the White House is the University\u2019s relationship with President Joe Biden and the opening of the Penn Biden Center. I argue that this is as far as Penn\u2019s ties to the presidency will go. Nowadays, Penn\u2019s laser focus on professional development might repel students who will one day have presidential potential.\nComparable institutions to Penn have high-earning graduates and prestigious placements throughout the government, nonprofit sector, and the advocacy space. For example, Georgetown University feeds graduates into congressional offices and many Fulbright programs. Princeton University also regularly features its flashy roster of graduates in powerful political offices. These universities maintain a strong presence in the private sector but are also actively represented in government positions.\n\tIn these examples, the institution itself sponsors an undergraduate school dedicated to public service. At Georgetown, it\u2019s the School of Foreign Service, while at Princeton the role is filled by the School of Public and International Affairs.\nI propose that Penn follow suit and create a fifth undergraduate school dedicated to public affairs. This new school could absorb Penn\u2019s wildly popular social science programs, like PPE (Philosophy, Politics and Economics), Political Science, and Economics. Currently, most students in these majors are scooped up by consulting firms and investment banks. If these students were given an intentional focus on service and social responsibility, perhaps they could feel empowered to use their degrees in a more meaningful way.\nThe least Penn can do is expand its current effort to bridge the gap between social science degree seekers and careers in government and nonprofits. It\u2019s crucial that our student body actively engages with the robust policy infrastructure that Penn has already made available: Civic House, Perry World House, opportunities like Penn in Washington, and extracurricular engagements offered by the Government and Politics Association. From what I\u2019ve seen, these resources are underutilized at Penn. By snubbing them, Penn students are working against the general interests of the University to gain prestige.\n\t\tGet our newsletter, DP Daybreak, delivered to your inbox every weekday morning.Besides, it's about more than just rankings. We have the potential to empower our students to become leaders in society. TIME Magazine ranks Penn as the third-best college for aspiring leaders. However, the article states its rationale for this placement as a concentration of graduates in business careers. Other chart-topping schools on this list were noted for their programs in law, medicine, and more.\nUltimately, private sector homogeneity marks one of Penn\u2019s key weaknesses. As we move forward, Penn has a duty to educate leaders in more than one field. If Penn strengthened its programs in civic engagement, more graduates would be inclined to pursue roles in government and could elevate Penn\u2019s cultural stature. We should be known for more than salaries. We can do more than business.\nJACK LAKIS is a College first year studying political science from Kennesaw, Ga.

          "title": "Mia Vesely | Black Penn is vibrant this month and every month",
          "article_content": "As of late, most of my columns have focused on things I take issue with: Whether it\u2019s Liz Magill\u2019s resignation and the threats to free speech on campus, or the lack of racial diversity in Panhellenic sororities. I haven't highlighted the things that I truly appreciate and, more specifically, the places in which I\u2019ve found community at Penn.\nLast February, I argued that Black history is important for everyone. Education surrounding Black people, their lives, and their contributions should be integrated into the standard curriculum. Black Penn shows up and shows out every month, but this month in particular, there are many events and ways that Penn student organizations uplift the community and come together.\u00a0\n\t\tIt would be impossible to touch on all of these amazing events and their impacts, but I\u2019d like to paint a picture of some of these groups and their initiatives during this month and beyond. Planning for these events takes months. For example, when Descendants of Afro-Americans at Penn (DAAP) \u2014 a club founded just last year \u2014 put on their first-ever gala on Feb. 1 to kick off the month, you better believe that the event was well-planned and executed.\u00a0\nThe gala \u2014 Red Carpet For A Cause \u2014 supported the Sickle Cell Disease Association of America's Philadelphia and Delaware Valley Chapter. The night included catered food, live performances from student groups like The Inspiration, wonderful community, and beautiful decor\u2014even including an ice sculpture of the DAAP logo. Over $1,700 was raised in support of the foundation.\n\t\t\t\tSEE MORE FROM MIA VESELY:\ufeffI dropped sorority rush and I\u2019m gladFirst Liz Magill, next free speechWhen asked about the impacts of the event, College sophomore and DAAP founding member Clarke Dickens said, \u201cWe wanted to bring the community together for a great cause, especially a cause that affects a lot of African Americans and Black people more broadly.\u201d\nSickle cell disease occurs in about one in every 365 Black babies born in the United States. The percentage of Black people who carry the trait is even higher, with one in 13 Black babies being born as carriers.\n\tDickens is not just involved with DAAP, but is also on the boards for QBlack and Shea Collective.\nThese clubs are all part of something commonly dubbed \u201cBlack Penn,\u201d which focuses on so many different aspects of identity. From cultural organizations like Penn African Student Association (PASA), to preprofessional organizations like Black Wharton and the Black Pre-Law Association (BPLA), to community service organizations like the NAACP, all of these organizations put an emphasis on service both inside the Penn community and out.\u00a0\nFor example, Campus Curlz \u2014 a club I serve on the board of \u2014 is, at first glance, a club centered around uplifting natural hair and embracing positivity. \u00a0But underlying hair mask making events and movie nights, there is a strong commitment to service. Just this month, the community service committee held an event where we made Valentine\u2019s Day cards for senior citizens at Mercy Life West Philadelphia.\nService by board members is a requirement to be part of funding organizations like UMOJA \u2014 the umbrella funding organization for Black clubs \u2014 and even beyond that, many clubs center service in every activity they partake in. Whether you\u2019re on the board of a club or not, there are many service opportunities available and encouraged.\nWhen asked what they wish people knew about Black Penn, Dickens said, \u201cClubs should make an effort to include grad students, it makes all the difference. I\u2019m able to say, \u2018This is what I would look like coming here for grad school,\u2019 and it can even offer opportunities for mentorship.\u201d\nWhat seems to drive Black Penn is first and foremost the students, then the supportive and involved faculty, as well as the local partnerships and opportunities the clubs find, build, and pursue for themselves. Many members of the DAAP board are native to Philadelphia, so that makes their work even more personal.\nWhile Black students do take initiative to realize what they need and create the spaces they want to see, there is so much room for improvement on behalf of Penn: whether it\u2019s stratifying the way funding is given to these clubs \u2014 they often can\u2019t fund silverware in UMOJA meetings if it can be provided elsewhere \u2014 or improving the cultural spaces available to students (we were promised the ARCH \u2018building,\u2019 not the ARCH \u2018basement\u2019). In months like February, Penn aims to spotlight their Black students. I just wish this recognition of the incredible community Black students forged for themselves, when they initially didn\u2019t see it on campus, came year-round.\n\t\tGet our newsletter, DP Daybreak, delivered to your inbox every weekday morning.Events like DAAP's gala happen every month, and it\u2019s important not to understate the role these organizations play in making Penn a welcoming and accepting place for students from marginalized backgrounds.\nI was happy to see Faces of Black Penn \u2014 a Black-run publication \u2014 highlighted in the DP last week. I hope people continue to uplift the work of these student groups going forward and make space to give all students their roses. Black History Month is not over, and the time to appreciate Black students and their work does not end come March.\nMIA VESELY is a College sophomore studying philosophy, politics, and economics from Phoenix, A.Z.

          "title": "Bernadine Kumi | I joined a sorority and I\u2019m glad",
          "article_content": "I\u2019ll be honest: I was not a fan of Greek life when I first got to Penn. My perception of Greek life was influenced by growing up in the South, mainly in suburban Georgia. This included a sorority scene of girls with fake spray tans and little to no personality. The images of sorority girls from the University of Georgia and Alabama screamed no diversity, which made me wary of joining a sorority at Penn. Being a First-Generation, Low-Income (FGLI) student made me especially hesitant. Even more so, coming from a Ghanaian household, the notion of a sorority was immediately dismissed as something against our Christian values. Thus, during my first year, I knew I would never, and I mean never, join a sorority.\u00a0\nHowever, by the beginning of sophomore year, my mindset began to change. After a year on campus, I had found a solid community of a small group of friends. But beyond that, I felt that I did not really know anyone. I couldn\u2019t name more than 20 people in my grade. Penn is known for being a networking school, and the \u201cSocial Ivy,\u201d so I began to question just how much I had taken advantage of that. That, along with most of the underclassmen party scene revolving around fraternities, made the idea of rushing even more appealing.\u00a0\n\t\tSo while most people were beginning their sophomore year with the friends they already had, I began to look for additional friends. My twin sister, who also goes to Penn, and I began attending open rush events, talking to sophomores in sororities, and involving ourselves in more social events. Over the next few months, my days consisted of talking to many girls, going to dinners, and putting myself out there in a way that I had been hesitant to do before. I made new friends, met fellow sophomores also in search of a bigger community, and found myself loving the idea of joining a sorority.\u00a0\nBut what made me even more eager was just how inclusive and diverse sororities were at Penn, more so than I had been expecting\u2014especially the off-campus sorority I ended up joining, OAX. I was still wary about rushing, but as soon as I got to the first event, I immediately felt comfortable. There were girls with different interests, passions, economic backgrounds, and personalities. Not a single conversation felt forced. Every girl I met had a unique and authentic story, and I felt like I could talk to them for hours.\n\t\t\t\tSEE MORE FROM BERNADINE KUMI:\ufeffDining hall workers at Penn Hillel demand better treatment from UniversityI was especially captivated by BLOAX (Black OAX), a community within OAX that includes fellow girls of Ghanaian descent and other Black girls who provided me with guidance on navigating Penn as a Black woman. OAX also has other smaller communities, such as LatinOAX and RainbOAX. Being able to find other people with similar backgrounds made the choice to join a sorority that much easier.\u00a0\nAs a FGLI student and Questbridge scholar, the idea of paying high dues out of my minimal work paychecks every month was unfathomable. I knew that joining a sorority would pose another financial burden, and even though I was loving the OAX community, the idea of paying dues scared me. Yet once again, OAX and other sororities surprised me with their understanding and financial transparency. They worked with me to develop an affordable monthly payment plan so that I, like every other girl interested in rushing, could also enjoy being in a sorority.\u00a0\n\tSince the morning of Bid Day when I got \u201cthe call,\u201d I know that I truly made the right decision by joining a sorority, for not only my social life but my professional life too. This past fall, I was able to land a summer internship in Los Angeles with the help of my grand-big. I was also able to prepare for my interview with girls in my sorority, who gave me the confidence I needed to land the opportunity. As a Black woman and FGLI student, I have truly benefited from joining Greek life. I hope students who are hesitant to rush, just as I once was, will see my experience and how transformative it can be. I hope others \u2014 whether they are Black women, FGLI students, or just Penn students in search of a greater community \u2014 can do the same.\nBERNADINE KUMI is a College junior studying political science and legal studies and history from Roswell, Ga.

          "article_content": "Columnist Jessey Shin explores the problem of disparate advising quality in the College and argues \nfor a more standardized experience.\u201cMy advisor lied to me?\u201d\nI remember someone saying this to me in complete disbelief, but I can\u2019t say I\u2019m surprised. Advisors can be as misleading as they are helpful, and this is a widespread problem that needs addressing.\n\t\tIn the College, students typically have between 15 and 20 credits outside of their primary major to meet the graduation requirement. These are used to fulfill general education requirements, pursue a second major or minor, or take elective courses that align with a student\u2019s interests.\nThe freedom to pursue one\u2019s intellectual pursuits is, of course, one of the draws of the College. I am looking to pursue two majors myself, in somewhat interconnected but disparate fields of study: the flexibility offered by the curriculum allows me to explore these interests without taking an obscene number of classes.\n\t\t\t\tSEE MORE FROM JESSEY SHIN:Making a case for the less popular college housesNavigating the maze of Penn's resources\ufeffThe problem is few students go into their first year knowing which major they would like to pursue, much less exactly which courses to take.\u00a0\nThe College puts a lot of effort into informing incoming students about the curriculum and what they have to offer, such as through the Compass module on Canvas that gives a foray into some aspects of the College experience (something that other schools do not offer). However, the sheer number of options can be overwhelming, giving rise to a unique need for personalized, one-on-one guidance. This is where pre-major advisors come in.\u00a0\n\tPre-major advisors, assigned to each student before they start their first semester at Penn, are a vital resource for College students. They guide students through the course selection process, encouraging and helping them as they explore their various interests and eventually settle on a major.\nI can say that I have had a relatively good experience with my pre-major advisor. However, I also found that some of the advice offered was not fully applicable to my circumstance, because of the recent transition from Penn InTouch to Path@Penn.\nOther students, however, are not as lucky. I have heard stories about advisors making their students cry, spreading misinformation, jeopardizing their advisees\u2019 course registration, you name it.\nIn an interview, one student (who requested anonymity) shared that they have had trouble reaching their pre-major advisor from the get-go. College students must meet with their advisor one-on-one to get their course registration hold lifted; without this, they are not eligible to participate in advance registration. The student was only able to reach their advisor a day or so before the deadline and has continued to have trouble with availability.\nOf course, their pre-major advisor experience was less than ideal. \u201cHer guidance wasn\u2019t so much guidance as it was looking at the boxes and seeing if I checked them,\u201d they said. \u201cI don\u2019t think I would feel comfortable going to her for personal issues, such as which major to pursue or how to explore [some of my interests], because I don\u2019t think she would point me [in] the right direction.\u201d Instead, they had been utilizing their PennCAP advisor (available for FGLI students) for these concerns.\nOn the other hand, some students are able to form a positive relationship with their advisor and find that they are helpful in navigating their interests. Rishi Dadlani, a College first year, described his advisor as \u201cfriendly and helpful. He gave me his phone number and told me to contact him if I [had] any questions \u2026 If I saw him around campus, I would say hi, and he always sends us a beginning-of-semester email.\u201d\n\t\tGet our newsletter, DP Daybreak, delivered to your inbox every weekday morning.This disparity in advising quality means that some students are at a great disadvantage compared to others. While some advisors are able to \u201cpoint students in the right direction,\u201d helping them take the right step forward in their college experience, others fall short. Their advisees must navigate the complicated process of learning about the majors, gen-ed requirements, and figuring out (the surprisingly difficult) advance registration process on their own.\nWhen done right, the freedom of the College curriculum can allow students to truly delve into their academic interests and eventually settle on the right path for them. However, that process requires a lot of research and planning that is supposed to be aided by a pre-major advisor. For incoming first years who are unfamiliar with the landscape at Penn and underclassmen students, this disparity in advising quality poses a challenge. Penn must ensure that all students are able to best utilize the resources at their disposal, and the first place to start is with the guidance they receive.\nJESSEY SHIN is a College first-year studying sociology and communications from Seongnam-si, South Korea.

This month offers an opportunity to delve into the depths of history: exploring narratives that challenge, inspire, and provoke thought. In the spirit of true academic inquiry and in honor of this significant month, I wish to highlight a selection of works by Black authors whose perspectives might diverge from the more commonly embraced interpretations of Black history and culture.\n\t\tIn recommending these texts, my intention is not to endorse every opinion expressed by the authors, but to underscore the importance of engaging with a diversity of viewpoints. These authors challenge us to look beyond the prevailing orthodoxy and to question the narratives that have become commonplace within academic circles. They remind us that the Black American experience, like any aspect of human history, is richly diverse and complex.\nAs members of an academic community that prides itself on intellectual rigor and openness, it is our responsibility to explore a broad spectrum of perspectives, especially those that provoke debate and reflection.

          "article_content": "\u201cWelcome to Penn! You are the most diverse class we ever admitted!\u201d The convocation rhetoric makes you feel so special. Penn is diverse because a student comes from Wisconsin and another from Kazakhstan. One plays the flute, one plays squash. Never mind that all of them want to be bankers or consultants. I wish someone had told me that nearly every other person sitting at Convocation with me would end up in the funnel. That however diverse my first-year class was, my senior class would simply not be.\nAs a teaching assistant for Wharton\u2019s required \u201cBusiness and You\u201d leadership course, I mentor first years adjusting to college and exploring careers. Someone confessed, \u201cIf not banking, then what else could I possibly do?\u201d If the best business school in the world (U.S. News debates aside) makes you believe you only have one option from day one, the institution, culture, and entire system have fundamentally failed.\n\t\tOf course, there is nothing wrong with those jobs: The last thing we need is a trembling economic system and inefficient markets. The problem is blindly assuming that one in two employed Penn grads and 80% of Wharton grads woke up and consciously made such a decision. Unpacking our culture proves how little of a decision this is and how everything revolves around two words: prestige and control.\nIt is common knowledge by now that Penn students are privileged. However, you may not know that for every single student from the bottom 20%, over 21 people come from the top 20%, blithely offsetting their upbringing. The result? An abject elite detached from reality. Okay, perhaps this is cynical, but if we are known for our elitist \u201cseeing and being seen\u201d culture, is it a surprise that 25% of us are so disillusioned to think the average U.S. salary is above six figures? Of course not (both not surprising and not true).\n\t\t\t\tPenn\u2019s alarming lack of socioeconomic diversity (despite efforts acknowledged this) unequivocally creates a culture perpetuating the value of money at the expense of everything else. The people you sit next to in class distract you with their laptop screens: purchasing a Gucci bag or booking Airbnbs in Cancun. The emails you receive are about banking and consulting events. This is the model. The only one. The only one, right?\nLet\u2019s be honest, \u201cjust follow your passion\u201d won\u2019t pay the bills, and I cannot blame an indebted or underprivileged student for desiring financial freedom with a high-paying job.

Which one makes sense for YOU?\n\tEveryone at Penn is good at planning, several are good at doing, and almost none are good at reflecting. The purpose of your college education is not exclusively career preparation. If this is what they had you do, I hate to tell you that you have been robbed. As writer William Deresiewicz argues, \u201cWhat you should want to develop in college is the habit of reflection, which means the capacity for change because most of what you come across in college will inevitably fade from memory. What is left over, precisely, is you.\u201d A culture, even more so an institution, should give you the tools to understand what model of life you want to live, not impose the model on you.\nYet, my student's question is central and inevitable: What else if not banking?\nAsking yourself what truly energizes you is no easy task, because it requires the vulnerability to let go of the comforting lifetime certainty that the predetermined path gives you: 2025 summer recruiting, analyst, associate \u2026 Well, the desire to eliminate uncertainty eliminates life. What do you plan to do after \u201csome years of experience\u201d with your future free time and why on earth are you not doing it now?\nIn his book \u201cExcellent Sheep,\u201d Deresiewicz advocates for the importance of time off, slowing down, breaking the cycle of endless achievement, and acknowledging the existence of a world outside of your Ivy League. It may be scandalous to some and unmistakable to others, but what if you replaced your obsessive passion for finance with one that is harmonious, perhaps exploring capacities you have not had a chance to cultivate? What if you did something you purposefully cannot put on a resume or post on LinkedIn?

          "article_content": "Columnist Mariana Martinez describes her personal experiences with Penn's dining services.A text from my friend lit up my phone.\u00a0\n\u201cDude, you\u2019re literally getting the reverse Freshman 15!\u201d\n\t\t\u201cThe what?\u201d I replied.\nAs an international student, I had no idea that Freshman 15 was a thing. But by the time I found out what it was, it was already too late. My eating schedule became very irregular: I skipped meals thinking it was more practical for me. Because of Penn\u2019s poor dining services and few inclusive food options, my physical and mental health were severely affected by the end of my first semester.\u00a0\n\t\t\t\t\ufeffBefore coming to Penn, when people asked me what I would miss most from Colombia, I usually answered by saying I'd miss the food. But as my first semester flew by, I realized it went beyond missing my country\u2019s food and more into an overwhelming transition and violent adjustment to the American diet, characterized by fast-food consumption, takeout over-reliance, and a lack of fresh food. It made my transition to college even more overwhelming than it already was.\u00a0\nI never expected diet to pose the challenge it did during my first semester. I didn\u2019t expect my food options to narrow so suddenly. The differences between the American and other countries\u2019 diets cause international students to mess up their meal structure. In the midst of the American diet, breakfast becomes the least important meal, meal times become arbitrary, and late dinners are frequent.\u00a0\n\tI found myself skipping breakfast because I couldn\u2019t tolerate American breakfast foods: bacon, potatoes, sausage, casseroles. I stopped eating fruit, and I started eating only one large meal a day. At the same time, I was pushing myself to be my best in my classes, clubs, and job while running on very little fuel. By winter break, my body was pretty much destroyed.\nAs I asked other international students about their dining habits, I found that my experience was not an isolated one. Some of them told me that they \u201cjust don\u2019t know what to eat anymore.\u201d Others said that because of their international status, they had a limited budget to eat off-campus and that relying on Penn\u2019s terrible food was torturous.\u00a0\nSurveys have shown that as international students transition into their lives at American universities, many face dietary challenges and health consequences. For instance, many international students report a halt in their fruit and vegetable consumption because they believe the United States\u2019 options are not as fresh. Others report severe weight loss/gain and stomach issues from struggling to adapt to an American diet that consists mainly of meals large in sugars and fat.\u00a0\nBack in Colombia, I was used to having almost five meals a day. My diet included cereals and a variety of meats, vegetables, and fruits. Other international students also report being accustomed to multi-course meals, often characterized by a careful, homemade preparation. On the other hand, the American diet narrows down choices abruptly. International students describe their choices as pizza, salad, pasta, French fries, sandwiches, and chicken \u2014 which holds true to the quintessential Penn dining experience.\u00a0\n\t\tGet our newsletter, DP Daybreak, delivered to your inbox every weekday morning.Being thrown into a poor dietary environment has a significant impact on students\u2019 mental health. Many studies show that students with poor dietary conditions are more likely to suffer from depression and anxiety. The dietary conditions at Penn have impacted my emotional well-being: It is very frustrating to feel like I have no high-quality dining options. The strain on my wallet as I buy groceries and off-campus food is also stressful, considering around a third of Penn\u2019s international students are on financial aid.\u00a0\nThe international student experience with the food at Penn can only be described as aggravating. Not only is the American diet more unhealthy than food in international students\u2019 countries, but it also causes disruptions in meal structure and health. As a school that prides itself on being diverse, Penn should really focus on making the dining experience more accessible for its international students. Not to mention an improvement in the food would benefit the whole student body, given recent events. It is clear that this becomes a matter beyond just food: it\u2019s also about inclusivity, general well-being, and enjoying the college experience.\u00a0\nMARIANA MARTINEZ is a College first year studying English and classics from Bogot\u00e1, Colombia.

          "title": "Chapin Lenthall-Cleary | The Penn administration farcically mistreats new student clubs",
          "article_content": "Guest Columnist Chapin Lenthall-Cleary highlights the bureaucratic hurdles that face student organizations and clubs at Penn.It's no secret that many of the University's student clubs are brutally exclusive \u2014 often demanding prospective members submit applications and participate in interviews \u2014 only to bar most of them from participating anyway. It's no secret that this system of club exclusivity inflicts a variety of harms on students: It deprives them of opportunities to participate in academic, service, recreational, and other activities. It shuts them out of a significant avenue of making friends. It pits students against each other. It furthers a culture obsessed with credentials over learning (or whatever a club's mission might be). And, as if all of that weren't damaging enough, it wastes non-trivial amounts of students' limited time at the University.\u00a0\nIt's far less well known, however, that the University's administration \u2014 especially the Office of Student Affairs \u2014 imposes numerous stringent, farcical, and sometimes nearly insurmountable hurdles upon new, often open-membership clubs.\u00a0\n\t\tIn October 2022, I founded Penn Humans vs. Zombies (HvZ), a (then-unofficial) club that held live-action zombie apocalypse games with Nerf blasters in David Rittenhouse Laboratory. The games were open to everyone and attracted a range of undergraduates across various schools, plus graduate students, alumni, a few students from nearby schools, and occasionally a professor. We required no applications or interviews, even for club leadership positions, which were filled by those willing to do the extra work to help run the games. Against even the advice of some club officers, I refused to charge admission.\u00a0\nI don't want to oversell this: Lance or not, I wasn't killing any windmills. One silly game with an earnest mission, of course, wasn't fixing a broken system, nor was HvZ the only open-membership club at Penn. But HvZ was at least one example of something the University desperately needs and badly, though not completely, lacks places for Penn students to find community and friends with shared interests, free from demands to run a marathon in a rat race just for a chance at being let in the gate. In fact, my uncompromisingly open-membership policies are exactly what even OSA claims to want.\n\t\t\t\tSEE MORE FROM \ufeffOPINION:\ufeffEmily Chang | No Senator, not all Asians are ChineseKiyah Akins | How I have been shaped by Black historyAbout a year passed before I realized that our zombies weren\u2019t the most soulless people HvZ would have to face. Last fall, after hearing about HvZ, the building manager contacted me, demanded that I stop the games, and revoked my 24/7 access to DRL. I reluctantly agreed to stop holding the games in DRL, but I reached out to the director of OSA to appeal the decision, where I was met with a tsunami of bureaucracy and an instruction to stop the games until they gave approval. The process involved meetings between multiple members of OSA, public safety, risk management, and others. When I asked to be involved in these discussions, I received the canned reply, \"[OSA has] not traditionally included students at this stage of conversation.\"\u00a0\nIt took over a month to get permission from OSA to continue the games and about as long to sort out the actual process of getting a space. There was just one problem: OSA's Kafka-and-friends committee decided that HvZ had to occur in an athletic space. When I tried to rent such a space, I discovered that doing so would cost $75 an hour, or around $4,500 per semester for a four-hour game once a week, an impossible cost for our club. When I told the OSA director that having to pay this fee to continue our game would be as good as a death sentence for HvZ and asked for the fee to be waived or paid, I was told to go find funding. I'll say that again: We spent months waiting, only to be told that we needed to find a way to get the University to pay us thousands of dollars \u2014 that we'd use to pay Penn the fee they decided to charge us \u2014 to play a game that costs them nothing.\n\tI did everything the OSA director suggested and more to try to get funding. As it currently stands, we have only a small fraction of what we actually need. And, I'm not hopeful, because this isn't the first time I've tried to get funding for a club.\u00a0\nLast winter, I founded Drone Club, another open-membership club. This one was dedicated to building drones, and I was willing to teach less experienced students the electronics, soldering, physics, and skills involved in doing so. Initially, I paid largely out-of-pocket for parts, but this wasn't ideal or particularly sustainable, so I sought club funding. With significant effort and about a month's delay, we got $220, about half of what we requested, from the Common Funding Application, the very funding source the OSA director suggested we use to find thousands of dollars for HvZ. In fall 2023, in order to secure larger, more regular funding, I applied for SAC recognition, the primary avenue for regular club funding, for Drone Club.\u00a0\nDrone Club was rejected for the sole reason of not having been on the PennClubs website since Oct. 31, 2022 (yes, that\u2019s over a year before we applied, and it\u2019s different from the deadline listed on the SAC website). The stated reason for the requirement that inspired that rejection is that \"student groups must be sustainable,\" which requiring students to check a box a year in advance obviously does little to confirm. Indeed, as I noted in Drone Club's application, where I asked SAC \"not to reject us upon a technicality, and instead judge us upon our merits,\" Drone Club's mostly underclassman membership is an infinitely better metric for sustainability.\u00a0\nEven clubs that are accepted still aren't written into the SAC budget until the school year after applying. Combined together, these requirements mean that, even if nothing goes wrong, a new club takes years to receive SAC budget funding. Under the current system, a sophomore who started a club now would graduate before having a chance at seeing any SAC budget funding.\u00a0\nThe above is only a small fraction of the examples of Penn institutions' hostility towards new clubs: being denied tables at the activity fair, having Drone Club removed from the PennClubs website for not getting Engineering Student Activities Council recognition (which, according to the PennClubs website, isn't a requirement), and more. If you're shocked by the severity and regularity of this problem, keep in mind that these are only examples of the University's administration\u2019s hostility towards new, open-membership clubs that I run (and therefore know about), which are doubtlessly a tiny subset of the full problem.\u00a0\n\t\tGet our newsletter, DP Daybreak, delivered to your inbox every weekday morning.Despite this relentless onslaught, I still don't know how this story ends. There's still a scenario where a powerful administrator decides to put the welfare of students above rules and diktats, and says, \"Enough of this nonsense,\" and HvZ gets to return triumphantly to DRL, or at least to another good location, free from extortionate fees. There's still a scenario where Drone Club secures its funding for parts, and the many other clubs doubtlessly facing similar farcical obstacles are instead met with a well-lit road, not numerous Harnwell-and-a-half-high hurdles. Heck, there's still a scenario where OSA lives up to its stated ideals and starts staunchly supporting open-membership clubs and exerting real force to get closed-membership clubs to open up.\u00a0\nThis hasn't been a happy story, and I'm frankly not betting on that changing. Nor, sadly, would a single exception for HvZ solve this massive harm to students, thrilled though I\u2019d be to get such an exception. But this story isn\u2019t over yet. If enough people, or even one person with enough power, decide to end this farce today and decide that doing right by students must always come first, there could yet be not only a happy ending to HvZ's struggle but also a bright future for all open-membership clubs at the University. To the administrators who\u2019ve caused this damage and to those who have the power to fix it, shape up.\nCHAPIN LENTHALL-CLEARY is a College senior studying physics and philosophy from Radnor, Pa.

          "article_content": "This semester, I somehow ended up with four out of my five classes being either directly or indirectly about ethics. As a political science major, I was really excited to take these classes, since whenever people talk about ethics nowadays, it mostly has to do with politics or international relations.\nAt a time when our reality changes so rapidly because of technology, and when we are faced with a number of global challenges, some people have forgotten about the importance of acting morally. Especially at a place like Penn, where everyone seems to be extremely worried about their future and their careers, people often disregard these values when they are caught up by the competitive environment. Because of this, one would think that ethics classes would be extremely beneficial for all, but do they actually contribute to making students more ethical individuals?\n\t\tAccording to my professors, they don\u2019t.\nIn all four ethics classes, my professors started the semester by telling us that ethics classes will not make most of us more ethical. I sat there, listening to all of them, and I just could not understand why they would say something like that. If I wasn\u2019t going to learn anything, what was the point of taking these classes?\n\t\t\t\tSEE MORE FROM ZARA TENA:The urgent need for younger voices in politics\ufeffIt\u2019s okay to be ordinaryThat\u2019s where I was wrong: I have been learning a lot. While perhaps the main goal of ethics classes is not to turn students into more ethical people, they definitely give us the tools we need to critically engage with ethical dilemmas. By taking these classes, I might not become a better person, but they have given me a space where I can explore, discuss, and reflect about where I stand on so many issues and what my beliefs about morality actually are.\nEthics is not a subject that can be forcefully taught through lectures and readings. There is no way that we can sit down for three hours every week and magically become more ethical just because we memorize theories and read long papers written by old white men. The goal of these classes is not to tell us what is \u2018right\u2019 or \u2018wrong,\u2019 \u00a0but to give us the skills to navigate the gray areas in ethical decision making.\n\tThese classes encourage self reflection and personal growth. Even when analyzing big case studies or exploring different theories, students are pushed to question their own values, beliefs, and biases. While this may not guarantee that we will completely transform our moral compasses, the self awareness that comes from these reflections creates a great foundation for understanding why we act the way we do and also invites us to try to understand others.\nThe fact that ethics classes begin with a warning \u2014 that you won\u2019t become more ethical by taking them \u2014 should not stop anyone from giving them a chance. The ability to think critically, understand different values and perspectives, and have the skills to self reflect are essential parts of any college education. They prepare students for the complicated moral dilemmas they might face in their personal and professional lives \u2014 especially when most people at Penn will end up with jobs that are notorious for their ethical scandals!\nZARA TENA is a College sophomore studying political science from Puebla, Mexico.

          "article_content": "How many times have you found yourself in a never-ending cycle of back-and-forth messages, trying to pin down a date for a long overdue catch up with a friend? Every get together begins to feel as if it requires intricate planning and strips away the simplicity of social connection. This routine becomes stifling, lacking spontaneity and authenticity; you\u2019re constrained to coordinating with the same faces in the same places.\u00a0\nThis is what I like to call scheduling fatigue.\u00a0\n\t\tAs a result of this phenomenon, gatherings among friends are beginning to resemble scheduled business meetings, meticulously arranged via tools like When2Meet or synchronized Google Calendars.\nWhile resorting to scheduling may seem like the only viable option to maintain a semblance of social connection, perhaps it's time to embrace the idea of venturing out solo: I\u2019m challenging you to go on an unplanned side quest all by yourself to a third place.\u00a0\n\t\t\t\tMORE FROM LALA MUSTAFA:A nation on defense: Dismantling misinformation against Azerbaijan in the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict\ufeff\ufeffAllow me to explain. Picture the first place as your home and the second as your place of education or work. Now, the third place emerges as a public sphere where individuals congregate, not out of any obligation like in the previously mentioned locations, but, for lack of a more precise term, to simply vibe. It could be the cozy corner of a cafe, a communal park, or even the neighborhood barbershop \u2014 anywhere that\u2019ll allow you to interact with people outside your usual circles.\u00a0\nYet, at many universities like Penn, the concept of a third place seems all but lost as our lives remain restricted to school grounds, causing even our first and second places to converge into one. While spots on campus \u2014 like Stommons, Pret, or the cultural centers in ARCH \u2014 can offer some respite, they often come with the latent pressure of being on the clock. Conversations here revolve around assignments, internships, and the intricacies of Penn culture. The chances of an unexpected encounter dwindle given that most people in attendance will be other Penn students. As we\u2019re cocooned in the Penn bubble, it comes as no surprise that many students spend their four years in Philadelphia without ever fully exploring it.\u00a0\n\tYet, this insulation comes at a cost that extends far beyond what we realize.\u00a0\nIt severs our connection not only from the outside world but also from ourselves. That is, within such limits, our individuality dwindles, reducing us to mere roles influenced by our peers. By excluding ourselves from a wider social sphere, we inhibit opportunities to engage with diverse perspectives, trap ourselves in a cycle of familiarity, and risk leading monotonous lives that pave the way to burnout.\nHowever, in our lives, both intimacy and affiliation with broader communities are essential. While intimacy often stems from our immediate circles, affiliation thrives in third places where spontaneous interactions occur. These spaces facilitate easy contact with new individuals on a regular basis, without the need for prior scheduling. As they consistently offer an opportunity for interaction with others, they end up cultivating the most reliable form of socialization.\u00a0\nSo, if you are keen on exploring new horizons and getting involved in the Philadelphia community, I suggest checking out the many informative articles dedicated to bursting the Penn bubble.\nNevertheless, I want to avoid confining third places to physical locations. They\u2019re more of a mindset, a willingness to embrace spontaneity wherever it may arise. They don't have to be far from campus or require spending money. Instead, third places can be any informal spots you visit \u2014 whether it's your student lounge, the library, or a community center.\u00a0\n\t\tGet our newsletter, DP Daybreak, delivered to your inbox every weekday morning.We often find ourselves caught up in the routines of daily life, clinging to familiar patterns of scheduling and social interaction.

          "title": "Beatriz B\u00e1ez | No closed captioning available",
          "article_content": "Columnist Beatriz B\u00e1ez explains her experience with language fatigue at Penn.On my first day at Penn, I called my father in distress, telling him I needed to move back home and study there as I was going to die alone at this university. My father asked why, and I quickly responded, \u201cI haven\u2019t met anybody in three hours. I have no friends. It\u2019s over for me.\u201d\u00a0\nThat very same night, I went to a New Student Orientation event at Houston Hall. As I nervously paced the floor in my Crocs, I overheard some students speaking Spanish and immediately gravitated toward them. Confessing, \u201cI heard Spanish, and I feel saved,\u201d I ended up meeting three genuine individuals, all from various parts of Latin America. Having arrived in the United States, it felt comforting to hear voices that reminded me of home. This comfort is priceless in such a foreign environment.\n\t\tAll my life, I\u2019ve taken courses in Spanish, spoken Spanish at home, and been berated by my grandmother whenever I spoke too much English. Arriving at Penn, I didn\u2019t anticipate the struggle I would face taking classes taught in English, as I had been lucky enough to have been extensively taught English from a very young age.\nBut speaking in a second language most of the time, even as a fluent speaker, is incredibly draining. Meeting native Spanish speakers at Penn was truly a blessing. However, I have found that some people react adversely to me speaking my primary language. These are not continuous reactions of a high degree, but there have been enough small instances to mark me.\u00a0\n\t\t\t\tMORE ON THIS TOPIC:Students celebrate 40th annual Festival Latinx, honoring Latinx culture on campusLa Casa Latina celebrates 2023 Latinx Heritage Month at PennOn various occasions, I have had Latinx friends say, \u201cLet\u2019s speak English so X person doesn\u2019t feel excluded,\u201d or even resort to English for \u201cconvenience\u201d when we\u2019re alone. For the former, I understand the sentiment. I wouldn\u2019t want someone to be excluded from a conversation in such a way. However, when I\u2019m naturally speaking Spanish, having my speech interpreted as a personal offense is off-putting.\u00a0\nIn one instance, I met a student through a mutual friend on a night out. This friend and I speak fluent Spanish; the person I had just met did not. Throughout the night, I had various conversations with my new acquaintance \u2014 who I found quite amicable \u2014 and my friend. I would naturally speak Spanish with the latter, not thinking much of it. The next morning, my friend told me how the new acquaintance felt I hated them for speaking Spanish in front of them, knowing they didn\u2019t speak the language.\u00a0\n\tI was shocked by the assumption and, in all honesty, a little offended. I found it quite conceited that one would think another person is speaking in their first language to actively exclude them. Speaking in a first language, for me, is purely a relief issue. Although I am fluent in English, after an entire week of speaking it, it can be extremely draining; thus, particularly in a social setting, I don\u2019t want to add to the exhaustion.\u00a0\nIt is more than fine to be curious about what somebody is saying and ask for a translation. However, immediately expressing discomfort upon hearing another language and presuming the other person is talking badly about you is inconsiderate toward them. More often than not, this language switch is for comfort. This was the first of sufficient instances that exposed a pattern in my time at Penn. In another class, I grew close to a few other Spanish-speaking students. One of them continuously suggested we switch back to English for seemingly no valid reason and would reply to any comment of mine in English.\u00a0\nThis harsh reality on campus expands into the club scene. In one instance, a native English speaker attended a club meeting primarily led in Spanish. Within this meeting, if club members asked questions in Spanish, any other members who answered quickly switched to English. Evidently, the intent is to have everybody be able to partake in conversation. However, members within a Spanish-led group should be able to detach from English formalities within club meetings, particularly if the club seeks to embrace Latinx heritage.\u00a0\nSpeaking in my primary language is the greatest manifestation of my culture, particularly since Spanish accents are so diverse throughout Latin America. Having to switch to English not only in academic settings but in seemingly every other sphere of Penn life further disconnects me from the culture I\u2019ve been surrounded by my entire life until now. This applies to any person whose main language isn\u2019t English, not only to Spanish speakers.\u00a0\n\t\tGet our newsletter, DP Daybreak, delivered to your inbox every weekday morning.Penn has students from over 100 countries, with around 19% of the student body being international. If one truly wants to immerse themselves in Penn\u2019s multilingual community, one needs to recognize that a language barrier works both ways. Just as an English speaker may be tired from learning another language, a non-English speaker can be drained from constantly speaking English. It\u2019s crucial to recognize that for the latter, multilingualism surpasses a simple language requirement and spills over to nearly every sector of their life at Penn.\u00a0\nLanguage fatigue is a true reality, especially for individuals who haven\u2019t learned English from a young age. Thus, if somebody within your social group is speaking their first language, which you are not fluent in, it does not give you the right to feel offended or urge them to speak in a tongue you understand. And, if you are a non-native English speaker, as much as you can, \"habla en tu primer idioma y que los dem\u00e1s se ubiquen.\"\nBEATRIZ B\u00c1EZ is a College first year studying mathematics and political science from San Juan, Puerto Rico.

And, if white is a moral choice, there is an enormous challenge: then you're challenging an entire civilization,\u201d said James Baldwin.\nWhiteness is the myth we\u2019ve been sold and under which we live. In our instruction at the University of Pennsylvania, we were told to reach for safety and to secure our decadence. So are the students now, but they are not nearly as certain that this is the road they\u2019d really like to walk. The students I knew have already paid that price for that ticket, and their horizons, on a human level, look bleak.\u00a0\n\t\tPhiladelphia is not a college town.

From the soil of this city rose heroes like Teddy Pendergrass, The Delfonics, McCoy Tyner, and Alfie Pollitt.

Students are developing a new language in order to deal with existential questions: What is the purpose of education and the responsibility of students in the wake of war? More than in my time, it is now clear that we, the students, want to be free. The crisis is deepening, and history is accelerating.\n\t\t\n\t\nFewer illusions are possible for the young mind in Philadelphia, which tempers and sharpens it like metal on metal. What the path to whiteness and an invented safety then produces is a delusional and unfree state. My peers, who are banking, coding, and consulting their lives away, are living as prisoners to the choices they\u2019ve made.\u00a0\nAll the beauty, genius, and potential I witnessed when we were young together, freshman year before the vicious teeth of Penn successfully \u201csocialized\u201d most of us, has been wasted, whittled down into dust, and lost.

The scramble for acceptance into mediocre clubs and fraternities is insufferable, and the false authority these groups stand on in order to make these judgments is embarrassing.

          "title": "Hanadi Abdulkadir | How poor dining hall food shapes our mental and academic capabilities",
          "article_content": "At this point, many Penn students have lived the terrible dining stories at a number of halls across campus. While it\u2019s important to discuss the health and sanitary risks associated with some of these concerns, it\u2019s also necessary to break down how this problem factors into students\u2019 academic and mental well-being.\u00a0\nOpening Sidechat every few days to see yet another picture of undercooked meat or hearing horror stories from my friends dissuades me from trekking across campus to eat at many of our dining halls. Oftentimes, I find myself skipping meals or stretching the time out between each one \u2014 until I accept the fact that I\u2019ll be eating the same food I already ate a couple times that week. Does this mean that I\u2019m probably missing out on some of the necessary vitamins or fiber I should be getting daily? Probably.\n\t\tNumerous Penn Dining Wellness emails live in our inboxes with tips on improving digestive health and practicing better healthy habits in our daily lives. Additionally, the official page for Penn Dining boasts awards and recognitions for sustainability and top college dining. However, the pristine and glossy promotional pictures of sandwiches, smoothies, and breakfast bowls tell a completely different story from the reality on campus.\nWith two of the most historical repeat offenders \u2014 Hill House and 1920 Commons \u2014 being the only consistent options available for on campus dining during the weekend, it\u2019s much more convenient to resort to the other retail spots scattered around campus. However, some of these locations are far apart, depending on where you live, and can add additional costs to weekly expenses. \u00a0\n\t\t\t\tSEE MORE FROM HANADI ABDULKADIR:\ufeffPenn should require an African American history courseWhy social media and Palestinian activism goes hand in handAdditionally, for students who are dishing out a hefty sum of money to enroll in the dining plan, going out of their way to seek expensive alternatives takes away money that could\u2019ve been better spent elsewhere. Considering that first years and sophomores are required to pick a dining plan for their first two years at Penn, it\u2019s no wonder that students have consistently called for the food standards to match the high prices of these meal swipes. Ideally, no student should feel like they need to resort to options outside of Penn; rather, outside options should be supplemental to an already quality level of options at all dining halls.\u00a0\nSince coming to Penn, my relationship with food has become much more complex. I need to look twice when picking out a seemingly clean utensil to eat whatever is on my plate or stare extra hard at my salad with suspicion before consuming it. But growing up, food was always a way for me to connect with my family and friends, to bring us back together even when we hadn\u2019t seen each other in a long time. Yet the food at Penn, at its worst, has left me frustrated and succeeded at suppressing my appetite \u2014 something I actually can relate to other students about.\n\tAlthough certain foods are scientifically linked to improving mental clarity and focus, I hesitate in reaching for those vegetables because they don\u2019t look as fresh or appetizing when lined up on display in Kings Court English House. As a result, I look for short-term solutions in coffee, which leaves me feeling tired earlier in the day or exhausted while trying to tackle my assignments at night. In order to meet my immediate deadlines, I prioritize some assignments over others, meaning some classes suffer in academic performance and perpetuate an almost never-ending cycle of playing catch-up. I believe that the root cause of all these problems can be traced back to the lack of decent dining.\u00a0\nThis same sentiment has been echoed by many of my friends and peers. But the dining quality at Penn can be mitigated if the University addresses the root problem. Whether that be promoting clean and sanitary workspaces when handling food or streamlining student complaints to Penn Dining other than through email, the University can restore student faith in the system. When it comes to campus dining, Penn can improve upon our experiences by implementing the changes that students deserve to enjoy, especially at the height of midterm season.\nHANADI ABDULKADIR is a College sophomore studying international relations from Philadelphia.

          "article_content": "During Penn\u2019s recent administrative upheaval, the University community found an unexpected silver lining: For the first time, Penn was making headlines alongside Harvard and MIT.\u00a0\nThe presidents of these three institutions were at the center of an infamous congressional hearing in December after their alleged missteps on campus antisemitism. I\u2019ll admit, there is something far more distasteful about chaos at the Capitol than the collective HYPSM prestige.\n\t\tBut many of us are taking our education at Penn for granted, shedding our \u201cque ser\u00e1, ser\u00e1\u201d optimism, and wondering at times what it would be like to go to a more recognizable Ivy. For decades, we\u2019ve all but exhausted our morale by clarifying to passersby that no, Penn State and Penn are not the same university. And yes, Penn is actually active in areas outside of Wharton\u2019s finance programs.\nSo, when Penn Engineering announced its new undergraduate program in artificial intelligence, many of us were enthusiastic about the University\u2019s growing role in the innovation sector: a space thought to be dominated by less business-oriented institutions.\n\t\t\t\tSEE MORE FROM MRITIKA SENTHIL: Removing legacy admissions will align Penn\u2019s actions more closely with its educational missionWhy changing leadership won\u2019t eliminate antisemitism at PennBut Penn\u2019s realization, of possibly its most practical initiative, begs the question: Is the University actually necessary in DevOps? Does sitting in a classroom \u2014 let alone one that\u2019s in the midst of a campus known for its influx of finance bros \u2014 really supersede what can be MacGyvered by a tech junkie with only a laptop, caffeine, and time? I want to give a definite \u201cno.\u201d Otherwise, I would need to hold my classmates and myself accountable for upholding all the exclusivity that comes with attending Penn. And yet, there are a frustrating number of anonymous netizens, D-list journalists, and LinkedIn bards who call Ivy League universities like Penn \u201cout of touch\u201d \u2014 remnants of centuries-old American elitism in an era of bottom-up grassroots movements.\nOne C-suite executive anticipates that \u201cthe best AI engineers and builders won\u2019t graduate Penn Engineering. They'll be global, builders and in the right group chats.\u201d His readers agree, with one commenter further emphasizing that \u201cuniversities cannot keep up with the pace of free market innovation.\u201d When these schools attempt to go against the grain and align with consumer needs, \u201cit genuinely looks embarrassing and out of date.\u201d\n\tIn an environment where the use of AI models is largely democratized, we\u2019re naturally drawn to the trope of a layperson who forgoes bureaucratic systems to channel their intelligence: creating life-changing inventions that would have never come to be under self-serving corporate and political influences. And when ignoring cases of succor \u2014 as mainstream media unfortunately does \u2014 there are many examples of such successes. Bill Gates and Paul Allen, co-founders of Microsoft, were university dropouts. So were Meta Platforms co-founders Mark Zuckerberg and Dustin Moskovitz. As Penn\u2019s over reliance on donors came to light earlier this school year, critics of the upper crust have continued to group Penn with other perpetrators of social stratification. The field of AI is, by nature, continuously evolving. And limiting growth in the discipline to those who can afford, and then succeed in Penn\u2019s Department of Computer and Information Science courses is counterproductive.\nHowever, these narratives misrepresent the intentions of Penn\u2019s AI program.\nTo make a better case for Penn\u2019s AI major, I spoke with Robert Ghrist, Andrea Mitchell Professor and associate dean for undergraduate education at Penn Engineering. He describes how the process of integrating AI in education is similar to the effects of increasing access to music recording and playback technologies. Now, there is \u201cmore music for everyone at much lower prices,\u201d he told me. Nonetheless, \u201cartists at the very top of the industry\u201d are increasingly the benefactors of \u201ca concentration of rewards.\u201d Taylor Swift is, as any current news feed can attest to, perhaps the most prolific embodiment of such phenomena. And professor Ghrist strives to make Penn an incubator of sorts for the \u201cTaylor Swifts of AI\u201d that seek avenues for academic growth, to actually be the \u201cleading edge where the best thrive.\u201d\nAnd to thrive in this discipline, aspiring AI mavens are off course by simply memorizing browser instructions in JavaScript and praying for a tech equivalent of the coveted Goldman Sachs internship. After all, studying AI is a philosophical pursuit: an inquiry into the nature of consciousness and ethics of creating sentient machines. It\u2019s also a political pursuit, for AI poses challenges in regulatory compliance. There are countless possible liabilities for even the most basic ChatGPT input, such as unprotected user data and violations of intellectual property rights. \u00a0\n\t\tGet our newsletter, DP Daybreak, delivered to your inbox every weekday morning.Needless to say, as you might have noticed in my earlier columns, I am not an AI major. I\u2019m not even enrolled in Penn Engineering. Am I, of all students, in the right to quash critics of the Penn AI major when I dropped AP Computer Science in high school (with no regrets)?\nYet, it\u2019s clearly irresponsible to follow the well-intentioned advice from tech capitalists when constant innovation is not particularly ideal for society. Maybe I\u2019m just afraid of a \"Black Mirror\"-esque dystopia, but there is a kind of ominous quality to the idea of highly skilled AI scientists off the reins. Penn, however, is cultivating an ecosystem that nurtures AI talent, albeit not by stifling the next Elon Musk or Sam Altman with red-tape-ridden academics; instead, Penn fosters ethically conscious innovation that addresses complex societal challenges. And so, the fact that I can engage with the Penn curricula across departments has a surprising beauty. The opportunity to become a part of this technological movement \u2014 or, dare I say, revolution \u2014 is the gift of studying AI at Penn.\nMRITIKA SENTHIL is a first year studying management and Russian and east European studies from Columbia, S.C.

          "title": "Akiva Berkowitz | An AI major by any other name ",
          "article_content": "Artificial intelligence is a topic we can\u2019t seem to get enough of. From frequent announcements regarding policies within classrooms to endless professors and visiting scholars weighing in on the unprecedented effect large language models will have on our lives, I\u2019m sure we\u2019ve all discussed to death how revolutionary ChatGPT has become for college students.\u00a0\nMany of us have even had the chance to firmly establish positions on whether the University should embrace the technology wholeheartedly or put in place safeguards to prevent it from eroding the value of a college education, but up until now, the vast majority of conversations have been on a non-technical level.\n\t\tThat all potentially changed in this past month when Penn announced their first Bachelor of Science in Engineering in AI. Thankfully for us, Penn has chosen to launch this interdisciplinary degree at the \u201coptimal time\u201d to \u201ccreate a society where AI isn\u2019t just a tool, but a fundamental force for good to advance society.\u201d But at what cost? To what extent should we be using college as an opportunity to hyperfocus on not just a certain field (computer science), but a field within a field? Majoring in AI panders to the pre-professionalism Penn is known for and removes many of the foundational elements of the field that underlie innovation.\u00a0\nIn an interesting recent LinkedIn post, David Magerman pondered the implications of a university building complete undergraduate curriculums around a \u201cmodern business tool that is a niche application of computer science, diverting students away from a broad education in computer science.\u201d He went on to ask pointedly, \u201cWhat's next? A Bachelor of Arts in Blogging from the Annenberg School? A Wharton BS in Quantitative Trading?\u201d\n\t\t\t\tSEE MORE FROM AKIVA BERKOWITZ:The newsletter is dead\ufeffIsrael under attack: What do you stand for?As a current computer science major, I\u2019ll admit the AI curriculum looks fascinating. There is such an array of eye-catching electives (from Deep Generative Models to Natural Language Processing) that, if I were doing my degree all over again, I suspect I would have been swayed to switch into the major. But as a recently graduated computer and information science friend put it, the degree \u201cseems like the cool parts of CIS\u201d without the heavier basics like operating systems, computer systems, and physics \u2014 building blocks on the entire computer domain. \u00a0\nThe question I ask myself is whether artificial intelligence is really enough of an independent field that it transcends computer science and necessitates its own major. Is the relatively new field of AI established enough, broad enough, and unique enough such that the skills we gain through taking just those mostly career-focused courses today will undoubtedly remain relevant in 30 years and justify the $84,600 a year sticker price? I simply wonder how likely it may be that AI will become so unrecognizable in 20 or even 10 years, given its breakneck pace of innovation, that students may have wished that their majors in college focused on more fundamental elements of the field that innovators keep turning back to for insight.\u00a0\n\tAside from long-term career effectiveness an AI degree would have compared to computer science or electrical engineering, Penn is known for its pre-professional student body, and this new major shows signs of that sentiment leaking into the curriculum as well. In contrast to the Penn Integrates Knowledge professorships that bring in academic leaders who deeply understand multiple fields to better spark insight between them, this new major filters various courses of study to pluck out the elements we find valuable today.\u00a0\nIn this line of thinking, maybe we should consider the true value of a groundbreaking Wharton degree in quant trading that would promise to \u201csculpt the financial moguls of tomorrow\u201d with unparalleled prowess in algorithmic trading strategies and quantitative analysis.\u00a0\nAll this is to say, I immediately understand the value the current AI concentration within the larger CIS curriculum has. And I appreciate the Ph.D. programs that take students to a higher level of understanding, once they\u2019ve taken the time in their undergraduate training to build the broad foundations. I simply remain curious of the true value an AI undergraduate degree offers us as students over other forms of study within the field and the certain level of indulgence in pre-professionalism that it plays into on Penn\u2019s campus. I truly hope that I\u2019m proven wrong.\nAKIVA BERKOWITZ is an Engineering junior studying computer science from Silver Spring, Md.

          "article_content": "As busy college students, most of us do not have time to cook our own meals, and if you are anything like me, cooking is far from your forte. The hassle of having to go to the grocery store, cook, and clean can be time consuming and even more difficult when you\u2019re overwhelmed with classes, clubs, and homework. For the many students without access to a kitchen in their dorm, this presents an even bigger challenge. Luckily, college campuses have dining halls! Students simply swipe their card to get access to an all-you-care-to-eat dining experience. Dining halls provide easy access meals to students\u2014but what happens when that food is inedible?\nAs a picky eater, I know that simply because I do not like a dish does not mean it is unsafe to eat, but food with cockroaches and glass is unsafe for anyone. A seemingly obvious underlying assumption in dining is that food is safe to eat. College dining halls should be a place where students go to eat well-cooked, hairless, and insect-free food. However, that is not the case at Penn: There is a lack of responsibility to make sure the food is meeting basic standards for, let alone satisfying, all students.\u00a0\n\t\tMeal plans are far from cheap. For the sticker price, students would expect quality food, but they would be wrong. Both of the first-year student meal plan options cost $6,330, with the maximum amount of swipes being 296. Each meal swipe equates to roughly $17, which is about the same price as a Caniac Combo at Raising Cane's. As previously stated, Penn dining hall food is far from gourmet, and its price is too high for the quality delivered.\u00a0\nExpensive dining plan meals are not unique to Penn, but other Ivy League schools have similar prices for better quality food. Cornell University offers an unlimited meal plan, so students may visit the dining halls as much as they want with a fixed cost of $6,942 for food ranked second-best in the nation. So, for roughly 600 more dollars, Cornell students have access to unlimited meals and substantially better quality dining.\u00a0\n\t\t\t\tSEE MORE FROM ERIC NAJERA: \ufeffWe should be grateful to attend PennPenn clubs should have an assigned faculty member\ufeffAside from price and quality, weekend dining is another struggle. With the popular McClelland Sushi & Market and Houston Market being closed on Saturdays and the other dining halls closing at 8 p.m., food options are limited. Late-night study sessions means having to resort to local food places that remain open, and unlike nearby schools such as Drexel, our dining dollars do not work at off-campus restaurants and out-of-pocket money spent on takeout can add up quickly.\nBefore every school break, Sidechat is flooded with posts of excitement for home-cooked meals. In my classes, when asked what we are excited for, most students reply being able to eat good food. It is not uncommon for college students to miss their home-cooked meals, but when students are excited to actually eat food that is not served alongside insects, it signifies a problem.\n\tWith Penn\u2019s Bon App\u00e9tit contract still in place, we may not know how much Penn can do to change the dining experience. Safe, clean food should not be an unreasonable expectation. In order to enhance a student's experience outside the classroom, Penn must budget for an edible food experience for all students.\nERIC NAJERA is a College sophomore studying history from Rolling Meadows, Ill.

          "article_content": "We all know the typical \u201ctypes\u201d of high schoolers, the different clich\u00e9s: Where are my nerds at? But, another attribute of student groups that has become increasingly relevant in the 21st century United States is the diverse ethnic makeup of its population. And, frankly, do we as a campus mirror all that comes with that national trend of diversity?\nThink of the friends with whom you often hang out. Then, ask those friends with whom they usually go out. Finally, think of the groups you are a part of, the extracurriculars in which you partake. Notice a pattern?\n\t\t\u201c[D]espite increased opportunity to live and work in mixed-race settings, Americans remain racially segregated in their friendship patterns,\u201d a study published by the National Institutes of Health found. \u201cSpatial racism, cultural encapsulation, and personal choice are contributing factors for patterns of same-race friendships.\u201d\u00a0\nThis pattern seems to reflect the divisions present in Penn\u2019s social scene as well. Despite coming from all sorts of backgrounds across the world, the University\u2019s students appear to have unconsciously adopted a policy of self segregation. In other words, we like to \u201cstick to our own\u201d by socializing with others to whom we relate to on a cultural, ethnic, or religious basis. So, regardless of Penn\u2019s efforts to integrate people of differing experiences and beliefs, there still remains a degree of resistance by individuals themselves to cross those racial or cultural lines.\n\t\t\n\t\nAs a result, the potential for diversity of thought is threatened. A narrow mindset develops within these groups that students pledge to, and they effectively act as echo chambers that exacerbate already crippling political polarization. We relate to each other less, rely on our \u201cown\u201d more, and become less tolerant of the views, and thus experiences, of those who do not necessarily look, think, or speak like us.\nThis kind of thinking \u2014 whether manifested in the form of race, religion, or otherwise \u2014 has led to serious tension at times and enabled a distorted view of certain communities and how they experience Penn. I attribute part of that thinking not to the identity groups we are a part of, but to how much we value them over who we are as individuals.\n\tHomogenous communities definitely have their place in the college experience: They help ease our transition when we first arrive at Penn, and their role cannot be replaced. I say this as an international student myself, who had a hard time acclimating to an entirely different culture and, most radically, diet. Nonetheless, we should treat these organizations as an aid to finding belonging on campus, not a substitute for individual thought and expression.\nHowever, none of this means individuals can\u2019t agree or always need to separate themselves from the group. The use of a large, collective voice can benefit our campus much more than we realize. What is important to note is that there lies a clear distinction between acknowledging the views of others and forcing ourselves to accept those views for the sake of conformity.\nThere is nothing wrong with disagreeing with the majority, whether it is one against two or one against a nation (though some may try to tell you otherwise). As long as you are respectful and driven by a desire to learn rather than defend, there are no limits on what perspective you may question. So, challenge your beliefs, reevaluate your viewpoint, challenge that of others (no matter who they are), and then reevaluate yourself again. It\u2019ll be hard at first, to express your precise, genuine thoughts without fear. But, remember that you\u2019re not alone (I struggle sometimes myself) and that it\u2019s a process you won\u2019t always get right.\n\t\tGet our newsletter, DP Daybreak, delivered to your inbox every weekday morning.The hardest part of breaking out of groupthink, after realizing it, is talking about it. My advice? Take the plunge and never look back. The next time you are in a group and the majority agrees with an idea you don\u2019t like, let it be known. Talk about it and explain why you think the way you do. Don\u2019t worry if some get offended or others simply do not agree; it is normal and, in fact, expected.\u00a0\nNever forget that disputes you engage in are an opportunity, not a challenge, and our differences are enlightening, not threatening. Only then will we begin to understand and appreciate each other more as unique actors in a truly historic community.\nZAID ALSUBAIEI is a College first year studying economics from Al-Khobar, Saudi Arabia.

          "article_content": "I downloaded Sidechat this fall after my friends sent me too many screenshots of funny memes or jokes posted on the anonymous app. I figured that doing so would simply remove the middleman. I was already being exposed to the same jokes, memes, comments and judgements as those on the app anyway \u2026 right?\u00a0\nIn December, I returned home for reading days and fell into an easy pattern of studying. Nothing I did was wildly exciting or social, but I instead found myself enjoying the routine and satisfaction of productivity. During my study breaks, I would scroll on Sidechat \u2014 and from the comfort of my home, I felt myself spiraling into anxious dread about returning to Penn. Each time I opened the app, I was faced with a barrage of posts all echoing the same sentiment: Penn is awful and depressing. Without a second thought, I accepted those posts as fact, and in doing so, I allowed Sidechat to have more power than it deserves. In other words, I subscribed to the complaining culture that is pervasive on Sidechat.\u00a0\n\t\tUsing Sidechat, especially without intentional thought, is a way of looking at Penn through hypercritical glasses. Perhaps this is because negativity has been normalized and cynicism gets more upvotes. To some extent, this pessimistic messaging is diluted with the insertion of mildly entertaining memes or jokes, but the result is still the same. With each scroll, Sidechat is perpetuating a defeatist perspective of Penn.\u00a0\nSo, I arrived back at Penn to take my final exam: openly unhappy about returning to what I thought would be a bleak campus as a result of discourse on Sidechat. But to my surprise, it was not horrific, and I was able to enjoy my weekend of studying just as I had my week at home. The sheer volume of disheartening posts on Sidechat had clouded my perspective and ability to see the best in the situation. Sure, I was becoming one with a Huntsman GSR while others were at home enjoying break, but on the other hand, I was with my friends and able to have a sleepy campus all to myself.\n\t\t\t\tAs is the case with most other social media platforms, Sidechat is consumed passively and without a second thought \u2014 it\u2019s used to pass time, curb boredom, and satiate our addictions to our phones. And yet, students are absorbing and internalizing content more quickly than they can truly digest it.\u00a0\nGiven the bandwagon culture on Sidechat, users often build off of one another, creating a chaotic, and often dismal, echo chamber that does not truly represent life at Penn. Whether or not college is the best four years of your life, it is at least what you make of it, and Sidechat enables students to feel like victims of an unknown cause. For those who are actually struggling, Sidechat acts not as a productive outlet, but rather as a meta ether that provides no remedy other than the satisfaction that others are unhappy too.\u00a0\n\tSince winter break, I have in fact deleted Sidechat and am all the better for it. I still get sent the best and the brightest jokes by my friends, but I am no longer overwhelmed by unsolicited complaints on an hourly basis. Without Sidechat, my thoughts on the housing lottery, the floods in the Quad, and upcoming midterms are completely my own. Deleting Sidechat may not be for everyone, but it\u2019s imperative for those who chose to use Sidechat to take a more critical view of what is being circulated and evaluate whether or not they are benefiting from it. It may just change the way they see Penn.\u00a0\nELIZA CARROLL is a College first year studying international relations and art history from Greenwich, Conn.

          "article_content": "Students for the Preservation of Chinatown protested outside the Board of Trustees meeting held at the Inn at Penn on Mar. 3, 2023. \nA few weeks ago, the streets of Chinatown came to life with firecrackers and lion dances ringing in the year of the dragon. As you walk through the brightly colored 40-foot paifang \u2014 known to most as Chinatown\u2019s Friendship Gate \u2014 you enter into a cultural oasis that has stood strong in the heart of Philadelphia for nearly 150 years. Beyond this fixture, Chinatown serves as a home to nearly 3,000 residents and numerous family-owned businesses, restaurants, shops, and community organizations. Whether you are going to Ken\u2019s Seafood Restaurant for a fun night out or Heng Fa for groceries, Chinatown feels like home.\u00a0\nUnfortunately, this community has been under constant attack for decades and is once again facing the threat of displacement and gentrification from a plan to develop an arena for the Philadelphia 76ers merely a block away. We firmly stand with the Students for the Preservation of Chinatown and urge you to do the same. \u00a0\n\t\tSince the early 1900s, Chinatown has been a victim of gentrification often driven by predatory infrastructure projects. In 1932, the construction of subway infrastructure at Ridge and Eighth streets \u2014 and the subsequent development of the Vine Street Expressway from 1957 to 1991 \u2014 resulted in the destruction of buildings and severe divisions within the community. Bringing in noise and pollution, the expressway eroded neighborhoods and people's quality of life. This was not Chinatown's sole battle, however, as it also faced multiple proposals of developments for a federal prison in 1992, a baseball stadium in 2000, and a casino in 2008.\u00a0\nThe story of Philadelphia's Chinatown mirrors other Chinatowns across the nation. Amid the 1994 fiscal crisis in Washington, D.C., then-Washington Wizards owner Abe Pollin negotiated a deal for the downtown Capital One Arena, where the city covered pre-development costs to acquire and demolish properties. Entrepreneurs in Washington's Chinatown voiced concerns about prices of real estate skyrocketing and parking impacts on businesses in the area. A decade later, most Chinese residents were forced to move out due to unaffordable housing. The parking shortage led to the closure of the last Chinese grocery store, accelerating the decline of the Chinese American population in the area to fewer than 400 residents today. Ironically, as D.C.\u2019s arena now relocates to the suburbs, the community is left behind, having endured irreversible destruction while in the midst of its recovery from the pandemic.\u00a0\n\t\t\t\tMORE FROM LIALA SOFI AND CATHY LI:Liala Sofi | The hypocrisy of billionaire philanthropistsCathy Li | Philadelphia\u2019s changing tastesIn New York\u2019s Chinatown, threats of displacement and economic insecurity also loom high. In 2021, the Museum of Chinese in America accepted a donation of $35 million in support of a borough-based jail complex which would displace Chinese American working-class people in the area. On top of that, its board executives were connected to the closing of the last unionized restaurant, beloved Jing Fong banquet hall, and construction of luxury towers that are actively raising rent and real estate taxes in the area.\nIn Philadelphia, the current 76Place project is being developed by 76 DevCo, an initiative by 76ers managing partners Josh Harris, David Blitzer, and David Adelman. Adelman is at the forefront of the construction of the arena and has promised not to displace the residents or businesses in Chinatown, but his past actions speak louder than his current words. Adelman works closely with Brett Altman, who also owns the University City Townhomes, and was a key figure behind the demolition and end of affordable housing in the West Philadelphia area that was previously known as the \"Black Bottom.\u201d This constant cycle of displacing residents and communities that have lived in the area for generations must end, and we must be the voice to make this happen.\n\tDevelopers of the project have stated that the arena will \u201cserve as a model for an equitable & inclusive community,\u201d yet there is not a single mention of Chinatown in the proposal. Efforts to ensure communities can benefit from this project read as empty promises when nearly 95% of residents, business owners, and visitors oppose the arena\u2019s construction.\nMany questions posed by residents have also gone unanswered by 76 DevCo. How will restaurants and small businesses in the surrounding area be protected? Who will clean the streets after huge events?\u00a0\nPreserving Philadelphia's architectural heritage demands careful consideration in urban development, but the development of the arena does the exact opposite \u2014 jeopardizing accessible low-income and senior housing complexes, healthcare clinics, and schools for children.\nPenn has direct ties to the developers in the area, and students should be cognizant of the situation. Adelman currently sits on Penn Medicine Board of Trustees and is the CEO of Campus Apartments, which houses many Penn students off-campus. But more importantly, Penn students are directly and indirectly involved in the Chinatown community, whether that be Penn Lions performing all throughout the city for Lunar New Year, or student groups like SPOC organizing initiatives to honor traditions celebrating the multi-ethnic communities that reside there.\u00a0\nDespite what greedy developers may suggest, Chinatown is not an ethnic theme park but a home. It\u2019s more than just a place to eat, it\u2019s a support network and a cultural hub for immigrants and visitors alike.\nIn the face of ongoing threats, Chinatown has demonstrated remarkable resilience and activism, advocating for the needs of all diverse communities of color that are integrated into the cultural fabric of our city. The next time you are in Chinatown, take a look around at all the place has to offer. Venture into Ebisu for some home decor and enjoy a Mochinut donut as you shop. Come by Dae Bak for soul-nourishing Korean barbecue. The opportunities to support your favorite restaurants and local businesses are endless.\nPlease don't turn a blind eye to what is happening outside the Penn bubble. Pay attention to what SPOC and other organizers are doing in the fight for the preservation of Chinatown. Educate yourself on what is going on in Chinatowns across the country. If you can, participate in programming like Crane Chinatown Community Center art exhibitions or Show Your Love for Chinatown events to learn more about the challenges facing the neighborhood. Sign petitions. \u00a0\nAdorned with dragon motifs, and gorgeous ornamental roof tiles, the Friendship Archway is not only an architectural masterpiece, but a labor of love \u2014\u00a0created for community by community. The engineers and artisans from Tianjin, China \u2014 Philadelphia\u2019s sister city \u2014 came together with residents and the city of Philadelphia to fund and invest in Chinatown, and you should too.\u00a0\nThe next time you walk through the gate, remember that the fight for Philadelphia\u2019s Chinatown, and Chinatowns everywhere, is not over. Speak up and fight for the movement so that history does not repeat itself.\nMore resources:\nGoFundMe for Ginger Arts Center\nAsian Arts Initiative\nGet our newsletter, DP Daybreak, delivered to your inbox every weekday morning.Youth Against Displacement\nLIALA SOFI is a College junior from Roanoke, Va.

          "title": "Caroline Magdolen | \u201cEveryone cheats.\u201d What can we do about it?",
          "article_content": "My guess is that nearly everyone reading this article knows someone who has been academically disingenuous, or been that someone before. Being academically dishonest isn\u2019t all about flashy examples, like the two admitted Penn students accused of plagiarism and fabricating data in 2022. There are smaller violations that may feel less egregious, or even harmless, like querying ChatGPT for help completing your homework, peeking at a friend\u2019s lab assignment, or answering a PollEverywhere as if you\u2019re in class, when really, you\u2019re snoozing in your dorm.\nAcademic dishonesty is having a moment in the spotlight. The advent of generative AI, the use of which cannot be reliably detected by grading softwares, will likely upend student learning for better or worse. At the same time, examples of plagiarism by prominent academics are being dug up left and right. The former president of Harvard, Claudine Gay, was ousted in part due to plagiarism concerns, and Business Insider found that former MIT professor Neri Oxman (the wife of billionaire Bill Ackman, who led the campaign against Gay) \u201cstole sentences and whole paragraphs from Wikipedia, other scholars and technical documents in her academic writing.\u201d\n\t\tTo be clear, I believe that academic dishonesty at Penn \u2014 going against community standards that your professor has explicitly outlined \u2014 is unacceptable, and that we should be doing more to penalize and prevent it.\nNevertheless, we must also acknowledge that academic dishonesty is understandable, in that we can piece together students\u2019 rationales when they do cheat, and even sympathize with them in some cases.\n\t\t\t\tSEE MORE FROM CAROLINE MAGDOLEN:\ufeffThe Rat Kings of PennThere\u2019s no better time for climate education\ufeffTo dissuade academic dishonesty, we employ sayings like, \u201cIt will only hurt you in the long run to cheat,\u201d or \u201cYou\u2019re taking advantage of other students who've completed their work fairly.\u201d This is true in some circumstances. If you\u2019re an aspiring quant and you\u2019re asking ChatGPT to calculate all of the derivatives on your MATH 1400 homework, it\u2019s going to show: First in your exams for the class, then in every math class you take thereafter, and especially in your future career. And if MATH 1400 is curved, your dishonest success capitalizes on the honest failures of others \u2014 not cool.\nBut this is not true in all cases. Jane* was a first year in her spring term when she was taking CIS 1210: Data Structures and Algorithms \u2014 a famously challenging CIS course \u2014 with Rajiv Gandhi, a famously challenging professor.\u00a0\n\tShe cheated on her coding assignment late into the semester, and as per the professor\u2019s policy, received a -300/100 on the submitted homework and zeros on all previously submitted homework, receiving a D as her final grade in the course.\nBut Jane believes that what is more important to her story is not what happened, but why it happened.\u00a0\n\u201cWhat drove me to make a bad decision? Why are [these classes] so infamous? It\u2019s because of notorious policies where you cannot collaborate on many assignments. You are given long problem sets to do, on your own, each week, with desperate students in office hour queues that are two to four hours long. Many times, you will go to the TA and not get a clear answer. It is a profoundly isolating situation, particularly for freshmen just entering college, and that\u2019s what drives well-meaning people to cheat.\u201d\nBased on my conversation with Jane, it seemed that she felt isolated at the time and was struggling to reach out for the support that she needed, both in CIS 1210 and at Penn as a whole. And given the limited support Jane could receive from TAs and her instructor, backtracking her friend\u2019s code felt more conducive to her learning than doing nothing.\nJane expressed a lot of remorse over what happened, and said that she still has a lot of respect for Rajiv, maintaining a good relationship with him to this day. She was also grateful that Rajiv was willing to handle this internally, since a low grade in the class looks better than a formal statement on her transcript, detailing her violation of academic integrity.\n\u201cI deserved to be punished harshly,\u201d Jane said. \u201cBut the collaboration policies of these introductory courses, and the punishment I received, wrecked my self-esteem and my early college experience. I felt that there was no way out.\u201d\nAccording to Jane, Rajiv's philosophy is to \"let go of your grades early: the sooner you stop caring about your GPA and start caring about learning, the better.\" She agrees with this philosophy, especially since he curves his courses generously, but sees this as out of touch with the realities of many Penn students.\nAfter students have prioritized perfecting their grades and resumes (and have been praised for it) in high school, those habits won\u2019t get undone overnight. Even at Penn, there are many institutions and accolades that continue to reward \u201cperfect\u201d performance over pursuing difficult academic disciplines, experimenting, and invariably messing up sometimes.\nFrankly, for a pre-med student in computer science (a track which Jane was considering at the time), the adage that \u201ccheating will hurt you in the long run\u201d skill-wise doesn\u2019t hold much water. The skillset of a future doctor and a software engineer just don\u2019t overlap enough. What can hurt a pre-med in the long run is a low GPA.\nAnd while there are some students for whom projects, internships, and technical interviews will get them a lot further in guaranteeing their success, this is not true for everyone. For many preprofessional students who may want to challenge themselves with a major or minor in CIS, they risk getting shut out of the study altogether.\nWhat frustrates me most about this entire situation is not that such harsh action was taken, but that it appears ineffective in tackling the issue at hand. If a student wanted to cheat, they could just take CIS 1600 or CIS 1210 during a different semester, when a different instructor was in charge and penalties were anecdotally known for being less harsh.\nWhile Jane\u2019s actions were clearly wrong, I can\u2019t help thinking that she was just the unlucky example that had to face the music, and she said as much in our interview: \u201cEveryone cheats in this class. You don\u2019t survive [CIS 1600 or CIS 1210] without talking to people, it just depends on whether you get caught. That doesn\u2019t make cheating okay, but it does mean that we need to rethink how these courses operate.\u201d\nSo, what can we do so that not everyone cheats?\nThis is a complex question, and there is no easy answer. It is crucial that as we frame the issue of academic integrity violations, we look at both the violations themselves and the root motivations that drive them \u2014 these actions are not taking place in a vacuum.\u00a0\nAcademic integrity violations these days are, to an extent, simply easier to commit. ChatGPT has led to a surge in \u201cunfair advantage\u201d violations. And even before generative AI, the pandemic had uprooted our usual test-taking environment. Now that classes are in person again, we no longer need to have take-home or open-Internet exams, but these still persist in some classes, and are easier to cheat on. Penn, given its history of fraudulent alumni, isn\u2019t going to be a place where professors can blindly trust students to refrain from cheating when presented with the option, so professors should take some responsibility for leveling the playing field in the classroom too.\u00a0\nJulie Nettleton, the executive director of Penn\u2019s Center for Community Standards and Accountability (CSA), relayed over email that CSA already works closely with schools and centralized resources at Penn to discuss how to proctor exams, and with faculty to discuss exams, syllabi language, and classroom policies.\nWhat constitutes a violation itself is currently not standard across classes, or even across different sections of the same class. How to handle a concern of academic integrity falls to the professor first \u2014 this is how Jane completed CIS 1210 with a lower grade, rather than a formal sanction from the CSA. It makes sense to delegate this responsibility to professors: It is more efficient than having the CSA handle every case, and professors should have the freedom to decide what constitutes cheating in their classrooms.\nHowever, this does open the door to students deliberately choosing sections of a course with professors that have more relaxed academic integrity policies. Conversely, some professors can be overly harsh, to the point where they are acting unfairly towards their students.\u00a0\nJill*, another student that I interviewed for this article, was falsely accused by her professor of collaborating on her final exam with her peers. At the start of winter break, the professor sent a class-wide email imploring those who worked together on the take-home exam to turn themselves in or have the matter escalated. Jill recalls that for students that turned themselves in, the professor lowered their grades accordingly \u2014 everyone else was reported to the CSA.\nIn the end, Jill\u2019s name was cleared, but she was assigned a case manager that seemed to have assumed she was guilty by default. As the case progressed, many of the details that the professor used to build the case against her appeared superfluous \u2014 for example, she and her friends had all rounded to the same decimal place in their work. Jill suspects that the escalation may have been personal: she had previously asked the professor, on behalf of the class, if he could make changes to his teaching style to facilitate learning.\nIt seems wrong to me that a professor could accuse a student and cause such extensive stress when in the end, Jill turned out to be innocent. It reminded me of some other methods that professors use to catch students cheating, such as Turnitin\u2019s flawed AI detector.\nPart of the solution to rampant academic dishonesty may also lie in expanding our vocabulary to discuss the issue, as John McWhorter pointed out in The New York Times. A class-wide cheating ring, direct plagiarism of original ideas from a paper as one\u2019s own, and copying a line of someone\u2019s code all constitute academic dishonesty, but range broadly in terms of severity and \u201cease of catching.\u201d However, this is rarely reflected in academic integrity policies.\u00a0\nIt can be awkward to suggest that some forms of dishonesty are worse than others, and more awkward still to draw the line between different punishments for different violations, but we must still have these conversations.\u00a0\nWhat should constitute dishonesty at all? When speaking with Jane, she would often circle back to how isolating it was to work alone on her assignments as a first year in introductory computer science courses, particularly as a woman in STEM. Every day, she would walk out of class \u201cfeeling way worse about [her]self.\u201d Now exploring chemistry, physics, and biology courses, she greatly appreciates the change in her academic environment, where students are encouraged to openly collaborate. The grade medians in chemistry are similar to those in CIS (which is to say, not great), but Jane is not as stressed as she was in CIS 1210, since she studies with her friends, and they can struggle and ask for help together.\u00a0\nWhile it was dishonest of Jane to copy code when it was against CIS 1210 policy, perhaps CIS majors and minors would learn more from the course if they were in a more collaborative environment to begin with. Jane has suggested that CIS 1210 should find a middle ground where students can learn from each other, but not be overly reliant on collaboration to perform well on exams.\u00a0\nShe also argues that there should be more opportunities for students to admit to academic dishonesty \u2014 through a friend at Stanford, she heard that at the end of a computer science class, students can select the assignments they have cheated on and receive a negative score on them, or risk facing more uncertain penalties if they are later caught.\u00a0\n\u201cThis policy gives people a second chance to do the right thing, and I do believe that you learn from an experience if you own up to it,\u201d Jane said.\nDeliberations over how best to address academic dishonesty can go on without end, but unfortunately this column must do just that.

          "title": "Jack Lakis | What we can learn from Penn\u2019s college ranking",
          "article_content": "Last fall, a plethora of new results from U.S. News & World Report, Wall Street Journal, and Forbes elevated Penn in their national college rankings. Nearly every list places Penn among the top 10, some going as far as placing the University among the top five. This universal growth resulted from a key change in most of these sources\u2019 metrics: greater consideration given to postgraduate salaries.\nPenn famously has one of the highest-earning alumni bodies in the country. Starting salaries for Penn graduates are often considered the highest in the Ivy League. By mid-career, the average Penn alum is raking in $165,000 annually, while the national average for a college graduate caps out at $74,000.\n\t\tPenn draws a great deal of prestige from its potential to produce high earners, which is a direct result of our school\u2019s preprofessional culture. Nearly 50% of all Penn graduates enter one of two career fields: consulting or finance. This pipeline allows most Penn alumni to matriculate into high-paying jobs shortly after graduation.\nI\u2019m usually a defender of preprofessionalism. It\u2019s crucial that Penn graduates are able to find good jobs, and high salary potential is an immense advantage. But those jobs aren\u2019t everything. Many universities are making gains in rankings and name recognition based on alumni outcomes in public service careers.\n\t\t\t\t\ufeffSEE MORE FROM JACK LAKIS:\ufeffDo we all hate Penn?Staying focused after Magill's resignation\ufeffFor example, Harvard University boasts about its eight presidential alumni. However, when 1968 Wharton graduate Donald Trump was elected president, Penn mostly ignored his history with the school. Given his proximity to controversy and his unconventional political history, Penn\u2019s bump in prestige was limited by Trump\u2019s election. Our second closest claim to the White House is the University\u2019s relationship with President Joe Biden and the opening of the Penn Biden Center. I argue that this is as far as Penn\u2019s ties to the presidency will go. Nowadays, Penn\u2019s laser focus on professional development might repel students who will one day have presidential potential.\nComparable institutions to Penn have high-earning graduates and prestigious placements throughout the government, nonprofit sector, and the advocacy space. For example, Georgetown University feeds graduates into congressional offices and many Fulbright programs. Princeton University also regularly features its flashy roster of graduates in powerful political offices. These universities maintain a strong presence in the private sector but are also actively represented in government positions.\n\tIn these examples, the institution itself sponsors an undergraduate school dedicated to public service. At Georgetown, it\u2019s the School of Foreign Service, while at Princeton the role is filled by the School of Public and International Affairs.\nI propose that Penn follow suit and create a fifth undergraduate school dedicated to public affairs. This new school could absorb Penn\u2019s wildly popular social science programs, like PPE (Philosophy, Politics and Economics), Political Science, and Economics. Currently, most students in these majors are scooped up by consulting firms and investment banks. If these students were given an intentional focus on service and social responsibility, perhaps they could feel empowered to use their degrees in a more meaningful way.\nThe least Penn can do is expand its current effort to bridge the gap between social science degree seekers and careers in government and nonprofits. It\u2019s crucial that our student body actively engages with the robust policy infrastructure that Penn has already made available: Civic House, Perry World House, opportunities like Penn in Washington, and extracurricular engagements offered by the Government and Politics Association. From what I\u2019ve seen, these resources are underutilized at Penn. By snubbing them, Penn students are working against the general interests of the University to gain prestige.\n\t\tGet our newsletter, DP Daybreak, delivered to your inbox every weekday morning.Besides, it's about more than just rankings. We have the potential to empower our students to become leaders in society. TIME Magazine ranks Penn as the third-best college for aspiring leaders. However, the article states its rationale for this placement as a concentration of graduates in business careers. Other chart-topping schools on this list were noted for their programs in law, medicine, and more.\nUltimately, private sector homogeneity marks one of Penn\u2019s key weaknesses. As we move forward, Penn has a duty to educate leaders in more than one field. If Penn strengthened its programs in civic engagement, more graduates would be inclined to pursue roles in government and could elevate Penn\u2019s cultural stature. We should be known for more than salaries. We can do more than business.\nJACK LAKIS is a College first year studying political science from Kennesaw, Ga.

          "title": "Mia Vesely | Black Penn is vibrant this month and every month",
          "article_content": "As of late, most of my columns have focused on things I take issue with: Whether it\u2019s Liz Magill\u2019s resignation and the threats to free speech on campus, or the lack of racial diversity in Panhellenic sororities. I haven't highlighted the things that I truly appreciate and, more specifically, the places in which I\u2019ve found community at Penn.\nLast February, I argued that Black history is important for everyone. Education surrounding Black people, their lives, and their contributions should be integrated into the standard curriculum. Black Penn shows up and shows out every month, but this month in particular, there are many events and ways that Penn student organizations uplift the community and come together.\u00a0\n\t\tIt would be impossible to touch on all of these amazing events and their impacts, but I\u2019d like to paint a picture of some of these groups and their initiatives during this month and beyond. Planning for these events takes months. For example, when Descendants of Afro-Americans at Penn (DAAP) \u2014 a club founded just last year \u2014 put on their first-ever gala on Feb. 1 to kick off the month, you better believe that the event was well-planned and executed.\u00a0\nThe gala \u2014 Red Carpet For A Cause \u2014 supported the Sickle Cell Disease Association of America's Philadelphia and Delaware Valley Chapter. The night included catered food, live performances from student groups like The Inspiration, wonderful community, and beautiful decor\u2014even including an ice sculpture of the DAAP logo. Over $1,700 was raised in support of the foundation.\n\t\t\t\tSEE MORE FROM MIA VESELY:\ufeffI dropped sorority rush and I\u2019m gladFirst Liz Magill, next free speechWhen asked about the impacts of the event, College sophomore and DAAP founding member Clarke Dickens said, \u201cWe wanted to bring the community together for a great cause, especially a cause that affects a lot of African Americans and Black people more broadly.\u201d\nSickle cell disease occurs in about one in every 365 Black babies born in the United States. The percentage of Black people who carry the trait is even higher, with one in 13 Black babies being born as carriers.\n\tDickens is not just involved with DAAP, but is also on the boards for QBlack and Shea Collective.\nThese clubs are all part of something commonly dubbed \u201cBlack Penn,\u201d which focuses on so many different aspects of identity. From cultural organizations like Penn African Student Association (PASA), to preprofessional organizations like Black Wharton and the Black Pre-Law Association (BPLA), to community service organizations like the NAACP, all of these organizations put an emphasis on service both inside the Penn community and out.\u00a0\nFor example, Campus Curlz \u2014 a club I serve on the board of \u2014 is, at first glance, a club centered around uplifting natural hair and embracing positivity. \u00a0But underlying hair mask making events and movie nights, there is a strong commitment to service. Just this month, the community service committee held an event where we made Valentine\u2019s Day cards for senior citizens at Mercy Life West Philadelphia.\nService by board members is a requirement to be part of funding organizations like UMOJA \u2014 the umbrella funding organization for Black clubs \u2014 and even beyond that, many clubs center service in every activity they partake in. Whether you\u2019re on the board of a club or not, there are many service opportunities available and encouraged.\nWhen asked what they wish people knew about Black Penn, Dickens said, \u201cClubs should make an effort to include grad students, it makes all the difference. I\u2019m able to say, \u2018This is what I would look like coming here for grad school,\u2019 and it can even offer opportunities for mentorship.\u201d\nWhat seems to drive Black Penn is first and foremost the students, then the supportive and involved faculty, as well as the local partnerships and opportunities the clubs find, build, and pursue for themselves. Many members of the DAAP board are native to Philadelphia, so that makes their work even more personal.\nWhile Black students do take initiative to realize what they need and create the spaces they want to see, there is so much room for improvement on behalf of Penn: whether it\u2019s stratifying the way funding is given to these clubs \u2014 they often can\u2019t fund silverware in UMOJA meetings if it can be provided elsewhere \u2014 or improving the cultural spaces available to students (we were promised the ARCH \u2018building,\u2019 not the ARCH \u2018basement\u2019). In months like February, Penn aims to spotlight their Black students. I just wish this recognition of the incredible community Black students forged for themselves, when they initially didn\u2019t see it on campus, came year-round.\n\t\tGet our newsletter, DP Daybreak, delivered to your inbox every weekday morning.Events like DAAP's gala happen every month, and it\u2019s important not to understate the role these organizations play in making Penn a welcoming and accepting place for students from marginalized backgrounds.\nI was happy to see Faces of Black Penn \u2014 a Black-run publication \u2014 highlighted in the DP last week. I hope people continue to uplift the work of these student groups going forward and make space to give all students their roses.

          "title": "Bernadine Kumi | I joined a sorority and I\u2019m glad",
          "article_content": "I\u2019ll be honest: I was not a fan of Greek life when I first got to Penn. My perception of Greek life was influenced by growing up in the South, mainly in suburban Georgia. This included a sorority scene of girls with fake spray tans and little to no personality. The images of sorority girls from the University of Georgia and Alabama screamed no diversity, which made me wary of joining a sorority at Penn. Being a First-Generation, Low-Income (FGLI) student made me especially hesitant. Even more so, coming from a Ghanaian household, the notion of a sorority was immediately dismissed as something against our Christian values. Thus, during my first year, I knew I would never, and I mean never, join a sorority.\u00a0\nHowever, by the beginning of sophomore year, my mindset began to change. After a year on campus, I had found a solid community of a small group of friends. But beyond that, I felt that I did not really know anyone. I couldn\u2019t name more than 20 people in my grade. Penn is known for being a networking school, and the \u201cSocial Ivy,\u201d so I began to question just how much I had taken advantage of that. That, along with most of the underclassmen party scene revolving around fraternities, made the idea of rushing even more appealing.\u00a0\n\t\tSo while most people were beginning their sophomore year with the friends they already had, I began to look for additional friends. My twin sister, who also goes to Penn, and I began attending open rush events, talking to sophomores in sororities, and involving ourselves in more social events. Over the next few months, my days consisted of talking to many girls, going to dinners, and putting myself out there in a way that I had been hesitant to do before. I made new friends, met fellow sophomores also in search of a bigger community, and found myself loving the idea of joining a sorority.\u00a0\nBut what made me even more eager was just how inclusive and diverse sororities were at Penn, more so than I had been expecting\u2014especially the off-campus sorority I ended up joining, OAX. I was still wary about rushing, but as soon as I got to the first event, I immediately felt comfortable. There were girls with different interests, passions, economic backgrounds, and personalities. Not a single conversation felt forced. Every girl I met had a unique and authentic story, and I felt like I could talk to them for hours.\n\t\t\t\tSEE MORE FROM BERNADINE KUMI:\ufeffDining hall workers at Penn Hillel demand better treatment from UniversityI was especially captivated by BLOAX (Black OAX), a community within OAX that includes fellow girls of Ghanaian descent and other Black girls who provided me with guidance on navigating Penn as a Black woman. OAX also has other smaller communities, such as LatinOAX and RainbOAX. Being able to find other people with similar backgrounds made the choice to join a sorority that much easier.\u00a0\nAs a FGLI student and Questbridge scholar, the idea of paying high dues out of my minimal work paychecks every month was unfathomable. I knew that joining a sorority would pose another financial burden, and even though I was loving the OAX community, the idea of paying dues scared me. Yet once again, OAX and other sororities surprised me with their understanding and financial transparency.

I was also able to prepare for my interview with girls in my sorority, who gave me the confidence I needed to land the opportunity. As a Black woman and FGLI student, I have truly benefited from joining Greek life. I hope students who are hesitant to rush, just as I once was, will see my experience and how transformative it can be. I hope others \u2014 whether they are Black women, FGLI students, or just Penn students in search of a greater community \u2014 can do the same.\nBERNADINE KUMI is a College junior studying political science and legal studies and history from Roswell, Ga.

          "article_content": "Columnist Jessey Shin explores the problem of disparate advising quality in the College and argues \nfor a more standardized experience.\u201cMy advisor lied to me?\u201d\nI remember someone saying this to me in complete disbelief, but I can\u2019t say I\u2019m surprised. Advisors can be as misleading as they are helpful, and this is a widespread problem that needs addressing.\n\t\tIn the College, students typically have between 15 and 20 credits outside of their primary major to meet the graduation requirement. These are used to fulfill general education requirements, pursue a second major or minor, or take elective courses that align with a student\u2019s interests.\nThe freedom to pursue one\u2019s intellectual pursuits is, of course, one of the draws of the College. I am looking to pursue two majors myself, in somewhat interconnected but disparate fields of study: the flexibility offered by the curriculum allows me to explore these interests without taking an obscene number of classes.\n\t\t\t\tSEE MORE FROM JESSEY SHIN:Making a case for the less popular college housesNavigating the maze of Penn's resources\ufeffThe problem is few students go into their first year knowing which major they would like to pursue, much less exactly which courses to take.\u00a0\nThe College puts a lot of effort into informing incoming students about the curriculum and what they have to offer, such as through the Compass module on Canvas that gives a foray into some aspects of the College experience (something that other schools do not offer). However, the sheer number of options can be overwhelming, giving rise to a unique need for personalized, one-on-one guidance. This is where pre-major advisors come in.\u00a0\n\tPre-major advisors, assigned to each student before they start their first semester at Penn, are a vital resource for College students. They guide students through the course selection process, encouraging and helping them as they explore their various interests and eventually settle on a major.\nI can say that I have had a relatively good experience with my pre-major advisor. However, I also found that some of the advice offered was not fully applicable to my circumstance, because of the recent transition from Penn InTouch to Path@Penn.\nOther students, however, are not as lucky. I have heard stories about advisors making their students cry, spreading misinformation, jeopardizing their advisees\u2019 course registration, you name it.\nIn an interview, one student (who requested anonymity) shared that they have had trouble reaching their pre-major advisor from the get-go. College students must meet with their advisor one-on-one to get their course registration hold lifted; without this, they are not eligible to participate in advance registration. The student was only able to reach their advisor a day or so before the deadline and has continued to have trouble with availability.\nOf course, their pre-major advisor experience was less than ideal. \u201cHer guidance wasn\u2019t so much guidance as it was looking at the boxes and seeing if I checked them,\u201d they said. \u201cI don\u2019t think I would feel comfortable going to her for personal issues, such as which major to pursue or how to explore [some of my interests], because I don\u2019t think she would point me [in] the right direction.\u201d Instead, they had been utilizing their PennCAP advisor (available for FGLI students) for these concerns.\nOn the other hand, some students are able to form a positive relationship with their advisor and find that they are helpful in navigating their interests. Rishi Dadlani, a College first year, described his advisor as \u201cfriendly and helpful. He gave me his phone number and told me to contact him if I [had] any questions \u2026 If I saw him around campus, I would say hi, and he always sends us a beginning-of-semester email.\u201d\n\t\tGet our newsletter, DP Daybreak, delivered to your inbox every weekday morning.This disparity in advising quality means that some students are at a great disadvantage compared to others. While some advisors are able to \u201cpoint students in the right direction,\u201d helping them take the right step forward in their college experience, others fall short. Their advisees must navigate the complicated process of learning about the majors, gen-ed requirements, and figuring out (the surprisingly difficult) advance registration process on their own.\nWhen done right, the freedom of the College curriculum can allow students to truly delve into their academic interests and eventually settle on the right path for them. However, that process requires a lot of research and planning that is supposed to be aided by a pre-major advisor. For incoming first years who are unfamiliar with the landscape at Penn and underclassmen students, this disparity in advising quality poses a challenge. Penn must ensure that all students are able to best utilize the resources at their disposal, and the first place to start is with the guidance they receive.\nJESSEY SHIN is a College first-year studying sociology and communications from Seongnam-si, South Korea.

This month offers an opportunity to delve into the depths of history: exploring narratives that challenge, inspire, and provoke thought. In the spirit of true academic inquiry and in honor of this significant month, I wish to highlight a selection of works by Black authors whose perspectives might diverge from the more commonly embraced interpretations of Black history and culture.\n\t\tIn recommending these texts, my intention is not to endorse every opinion expressed by the authors, but to underscore the importance of engaging with a diversity of viewpoints. These authors challenge us to look beyond the prevailing orthodoxy and to question the narratives that have become commonplace within academic circles. They remind us that the Black American experience, like any aspect of human history, is richly diverse and complex.\nAs members of an academic community that prides itself on intellectual rigor and openness, it is our responsibility to explore a broad spectrum of perspectives, especially those that provoke debate and reflection.

          "article_content": "\u201cWelcome to Penn! You are the most diverse class we ever admitted!\u201d The convocation rhetoric makes you feel so special. Penn is diverse because a student comes from Wisconsin and another from Kazakhstan. One plays the flute, one plays squash. Never mind that all of them want to be bankers or consultants. I wish someone had told me that nearly every other person sitting at Convocation with me would end up in the funnel. That however diverse my first-year class was, my senior class would simply not be.\nAs a teaching assistant for Wharton\u2019s required \u201cBusiness and You\u201d leadership course, I mentor first years adjusting to college and exploring careers. Someone confessed, \u201cIf not banking, then what else could I possibly do?\u201d If the best business school in the world (U.S. News debates aside) makes you believe you only have one option from day one, the institution, culture, and entire system have fundamentally failed.\n\t\tOf course, there is nothing wrong with those jobs: The last thing we need is a trembling economic system and inefficient markets. The problem is blindly assuming that one in two employed Penn grads and 80% of Wharton grads woke up and consciously made such a decision. Unpacking our culture proves how little of a decision this is and how everything revolves around two words: prestige and control.\nIt is common knowledge by now that Penn students are privileged. However, you may not know that for every single student from the bottom 20%, over 21 people come from the top 20%, blithely offsetting their upbringing. The result? An abject elite detached from reality. Okay, perhaps this is cynical, but if we are known for our elitist \u201cseeing and being seen\u201d culture, is it a surprise that 25% of us are so disillusioned to think the average U.S. salary is above six figures? Of course not (both not surprising and not true).\n\t\t\t\tPenn\u2019s alarming lack of socioeconomic diversity (despite efforts acknowledged this) unequivocally creates a culture perpetuating the value of money at the expense of everything else. The people you sit next to in class distract you with their laptop screens: purchasing a Gucci bag or booking Airbnbs in Cancun. The emails you receive are about banking and consulting events. This is the model. The only one. The only one, right?\nLet\u2019s be honest, \u201cjust follow your passion\u201d won\u2019t pay the bills, and I cannot blame an indebted or underprivileged student for desiring financial freedom with a high-paying job. This is why I am not saying the Wall Street lifestyle is unethical, although like others, I could. I am saying this is only one way to live your life. One of infinitely many. Which one makes sense for YOU?\n\tEveryone at Penn is good at planning, several are good at doing, and almost none are good at reflecting. The purpose of your college education is not exclusively career preparation. If this is what they had you do, I hate to tell you that you have been robbed. As writer William Deresiewicz argues, \u201cWhat you should want to develop in college is the habit of reflection, which means the capacity for change because most of what you come across in college will inevitably fade from memory. What is left over, precisely, is you.\u201d A culture, even more so an institution, should give you the tools to understand what model of life you want to live, not impose the model on you.\nYet, my student's question is central and inevitable: What else if not banking?\nAsking yourself what truly energizes you is no easy task, because it requires the vulnerability to let go of the comforting lifetime certainty that the predetermined path gives you: 2025 summer recruiting, analyst, associate \u2026 Well, the desire to eliminate uncertainty eliminates life. What do you plan to do after \u201csome years of experience\u201d with your future free time and why on earth are you not doing it now?\nIn his book \u201cExcellent Sheep,\u201d Deresiewicz advocates for the importance of time off, slowing down, breaking the cycle of endless achievement, and acknowledging the existence of a world outside of your Ivy League. It may be scandalous to some and unmistakable to others, but what if you replaced your obsessive passion for finance with one that is harmonious, perhaps exploring capacities you have not had a chance to cultivate? What if you did something you purposefully cannot put on a resume or post on LinkedIn? Yes, you may be \u201cbehind\u201d those who doubtlessly persist in the hierarchy, but what is the purpose of being at the top if you are climbing the wrong mountain?\n\t\tGet our newsletter, DP Daybreak, delivered to your inbox every weekday morning.The main idea behind the Pathless Path is not to neglect the ambition that got us where we are (not even to stop using Path@Penn), but rather to remember that Penn is not a four-year treadmill to (and playground for) the American elite. Yes, it was founded for them, but Penn\u2019s core mission today is the pursuit, enhancement, and dissemination of knowledge.

          "article_content": "Columnist Mariana Martinez describes her personal experiences with Penn's dining services.A text from my friend lit up my phone.\u00a0\n\u201cDude, you\u2019re literally getting the reverse Freshman 15!\u201d\n\t\t\u201cThe what?\u201d I replied.\nAs an international student, I had no idea that Freshman 15 was a thing. But by the time I found out what it was, it was already too late. My eating schedule became very irregular: I skipped meals thinking it was more practical for me. Because of Penn\u2019s poor dining services and few inclusive food options, my physical and mental health were severely affected by the end of my first semester.\u00a0\n\t\t\t\t\ufeffBefore coming to Penn, when people asked me what I would miss most from Colombia, I usually answered by saying I'd miss the food. But as my first semester flew by, I realized it went beyond missing my country\u2019s food and more into an overwhelming transition and violent adjustment to the American diet, characterized by fast-food consumption, takeout over-reliance, and a lack of fresh food. It made my transition to college even more overwhelming than it already was.\u00a0\nI never expected diet to pose the challenge it did during my first semester. I didn\u2019t expect my food options to narrow so suddenly. The differences between the American and other countries\u2019 diets cause international students to mess up their meal structure. In the midst of the American diet, breakfast becomes the least important meal, meal times become arbitrary, and late dinners are frequent.\u00a0\n\tI found myself skipping breakfast because I couldn\u2019t tolerate American breakfast foods: bacon, potatoes, sausage, casseroles. I stopped eating fruit, and I started eating only one large meal a day. At the same time, I was pushing myself to be my best in my classes, clubs, and job while running on very little fuel. By winter break, my body was pretty much destroyed.\nAs I asked other international students about their dining habits, I found that my experience was not an isolated one. Some of them told me that they \u201cjust don\u2019t know what to eat anymore.\u201d Others said that because of their international status, they had a limited budget to eat off-campus and that relying on Penn\u2019s terrible food was torturous.\u00a0\nSurveys have shown that as international students transition into their lives at American universities, many face dietary challenges and health consequences. For instance, many international students report a halt in their fruit and vegetable consumption because they believe the United States\u2019 options are not as fresh. Others report severe weight loss/gain and stomach issues from struggling to adapt to an American diet that consists mainly of meals large in sugars and fat.\u00a0\nBack in Colombia, I was used to having almost five meals a day. My diet included cereals and a variety of meats, vegetables, and fruits. Other international students also report being accustomed to multi-course meals, often characterized by a careful, homemade preparation. On the other hand, the American diet narrows down choices abruptly. International students describe their choices as pizza, salad, pasta, French fries, sandwiches, and chicken \u2014 which holds true to the quintessential Penn dining experience.\u00a0\n\t\tGet our newsletter, DP Daybreak, delivered to your inbox every weekday morning.Being thrown into a poor dietary environment has a significant impact on students\u2019 mental health. Many studies show that students with poor dietary conditions are more likely to suffer from depression and anxiety. The dietary conditions at Penn have impacted my emotional well-being: It is very frustrating to feel like I have no high-quality dining options. The strain on my wallet as I buy groceries and off-campus food is also stressful, considering around a third of Penn\u2019s international students are on financial aid.\u00a0\nThe international student experience with the food at Penn can only be described as aggravating. Not only is the American diet more unhealthy than food in international students\u2019 countries, but it also causes disruptions in meal structure and health. As a school that prides itself on being diverse, Penn should really focus on making the dining experience more accessible for its international students. Not to mention an improvement in the food would benefit the whole student body, given recent events. It is clear that this becomes a matter beyond just food: it\u2019s also about inclusivity, general well-being, and enjoying the college experience.\u00a0\nMARIANA MARTINEZ is a College first year studying English and classics from Bogot\u00e1, Colombia.

          "title": "Chapin Lenthall-Cleary | The Penn administration farcically mistreats new student clubs",
          "article_content": "Guest Columnist Chapin Lenthall-Cleary highlights the bureaucratic hurdles that face student organizations and clubs at Penn.It's no secret that many of the University's student clubs are brutally exclusive \u2014 often demanding prospective members submit applications and participate in interviews \u2014 only to bar most of them from participating anyway. It's no secret that this system of club exclusivity inflicts a variety of harms on students: It deprives them of opportunities to participate in academic, service, recreational, and other activities. It shuts them out of a significant avenue of making friends. It pits students against each other. It furthers a culture obsessed with credentials over learning (or whatever a club's mission might be). And, as if all of that weren't damaging enough, it wastes non-trivial amounts of students' limited time at the University.\u00a0\nIt's far less well known, however, that the University's administration \u2014 especially the Office of Student Affairs \u2014 imposes numerous stringent, farcical, and sometimes nearly insurmountable hurdles upon new, often open-membership clubs.\u00a0\n\t\tIn October 2022, I founded Penn Humans vs. Zombies (HvZ), a (then-unofficial) club that held live-action zombie apocalypse games with Nerf blasters in David Rittenhouse Laboratory. The games were open to everyone and attracted a range of undergraduates across various schools, plus graduate students, alumni, a few students from nearby schools, and occasionally a professor. We required no applications or interviews, even for club leadership positions, which were filled by those willing to do the extra work to help run the games. Against even the advice of some club officers, I refused to charge admission.\u00a0\nI don't want to oversell this: Lance or not, I wasn't killing any windmills. One silly game with an earnest mission, of course, wasn't fixing a broken system, nor was HvZ the only open-membership club at Penn. But HvZ was at least one example of something the University desperately needs and badly, though not completely, lacks places for Penn students to find community and friends with shared interests, free from demands to run a marathon in a rat race just for a chance at being let in the gate. In fact, my uncompromisingly open-membership policies are exactly what even OSA claims to want.\n\t\t\t\tSEE MORE FROM \ufeffOPINION:\ufeffEmily Chang | No Senator, not all Asians are ChineseKiyah Akins | How I have been shaped by Black historyAbout a year passed before I realized that our zombies weren\u2019t the most soulless people HvZ would have to face. Last fall, after hearing about HvZ, the building manager contacted me, demanded that I stop the games, and revoked my 24/7 access to DRL. I reluctantly agreed to stop holding the games in DRL, but I reached out to the director of OSA to appeal the decision, where I was met with a tsunami of bureaucracy and an instruction to stop the games until they gave approval. The process involved meetings between multiple members of OSA, public safety, risk management, and others. When I asked to be involved in these discussions, I received the canned reply, \"[OSA has] not traditionally included students at this stage of conversation.\"\u00a0\nIt took over a month to get permission from OSA to continue the games and about as long to sort out the actual process of getting a space. There was just one problem: OSA's Kafka-and-friends committee decided that HvZ had to occur in an athletic space. When I tried to rent such a space, I discovered that doing so would cost $75 an hour, or around $4,500 per semester for a four-hour game once a week, an impossible cost for our club. When I told the OSA director that having to pay this fee to continue our game would be as good as a death sentence for HvZ and asked for the fee to be waived or paid, I was told to go find funding. I'll say that again: We spent months waiting, only to be told that we needed to find a way to get the University to pay us thousands of dollars \u2014 that we'd use to pay Penn the fee they decided to charge us \u2014 to play a game that costs them nothing.\n\tI did everything the OSA director suggested and more to try to get funding. As it currently stands, we have only a small fraction of what we actually need. And, I'm not hopeful, because this isn't the first time I've tried to get funding for a club.\u00a0\nLast winter, I founded Drone Club, another open-membership club. This one was dedicated to building drones, and I was willing to teach less experienced students the electronics, soldering, physics, and skills involved in doing so. Initially, I paid largely out-of-pocket for parts, but this wasn't ideal or particularly sustainable, so I sought club funding. With significant effort and about a month's delay, we got $220, about half of what we requested, from the Common Funding Application, the very funding source the OSA director suggested we use to find thousands of dollars for HvZ. In fall 2023, in order to secure larger, more regular funding, I applied for SAC recognition, the primary avenue for regular club funding, for Drone Club.\u00a0\nDrone Club was rejected for the sole reason of not having been on the PennClubs website since Oct. 31, 2022 (yes, that\u2019s over a year before we applied, and it\u2019s different from the deadline listed on the SAC website). The stated reason for the requirement that inspired that rejection is that \"student groups must be sustainable,\" which requiring students to check a box a year in advance obviously does little to confirm. Indeed, as I noted in Drone Club's application, where I asked SAC \"not to reject us upon a technicality, and instead judge us upon our merits,\" Drone Club's mostly underclassman membership is an infinitely better metric for sustainability.\u00a0\nEven clubs that are accepted still aren't written into the SAC budget until the school year after applying. Combined together, these requirements mean that, even if nothing goes wrong, a new club takes years to receive SAC budget funding. Under the current system, a sophomore who started a club now would graduate before having a chance at seeing any SAC budget funding.\u00a0\nThe above is only a small fraction of the examples of Penn institutions' hostility towards new clubs: being denied tables at the activity fair, having Drone Club removed from the PennClubs website for not getting Engineering Student Activities Council recognition (which, according to the PennClubs website, isn't a requirement), and more. If you're shocked by the severity and regularity of this problem, keep in mind that these are only examples of the University's administration\u2019s hostility towards new, open-membership clubs that I run (and therefore know about), which are doubtlessly a tiny subset of the full problem.\u00a0\n\t\tGet our newsletter, DP Daybreak, delivered to your inbox every weekday morning.Despite this relentless onslaught, I still don't know how this story ends. There's still a scenario where a powerful administrator decides to put the welfare of students above rules and diktats, and says, \"Enough of this nonsense,\" and HvZ gets to return triumphantly to DRL, or at least to another good location, free from extortionate fees. There's still a scenario where Drone Club secures its funding for parts, and the many other clubs doubtlessly facing similar farcical obstacles are instead met with a well-lit road, not numerous Harnwell-and-a-half-high hurdles. Heck, there's still a scenario where OSA lives up to its stated ideals and starts staunchly supporting open-membership clubs and exerting real force to get closed-membership clubs to open up.\u00a0\nThis hasn't been a happy story, and I'm frankly not betting on that changing. Nor, sadly, would a single exception for HvZ solve this massive harm to students, thrilled though I\u2019d be to get such an exception. But this story isn\u2019t over yet. If enough people, or even one person with enough power, decide to end this farce today and decide that doing right by students must always come first, there could yet be not only a happy ending to HvZ's struggle but also a bright future for all open-membership clubs at the University. To the administrators who\u2019ve caused this damage and to those who have the power to fix it, shape up.\nCHAPIN LENTHALL-CLEARY is a College senior studying physics and philosophy from Radnor, Pa.

          "article_content": "I support the use of ChatGPT.\nA statement that, said aloud, would garner me sidelong stares despite the website\u2019s appearance in many lecture halls.\n\t\tThe use of ChatGPT has raised much debate among students and become a topic of considerable contention. Similarly, many professors hold polarizing views, as the use of generative AI has been harshly rejected in some classrooms while others have tentative policies supporting its usage. The limitation of emerging technology in educational spaces should raise alarm bells, as we are rejecting tools that could be invaluable for facilitating learning. \u00a0\nTo be clear, I am against academic dishonesty, and I haven\u2019t used ChatGPT in a duplicitous manner. However, saying that ChatGPT is synonymous with academic misconduct is a remarkably weighty statement. I do assent that some individuals could use ChatGPT in an academically dishonest way, such as employing it to write papers in their stead. But, a similar result could be accomplished via other online tools, like Google. Just recently, we have become privy to accusations of plagiarism by former Harvard President Claudine Gay, revealing how this is not solely a ChatGPT issue. Thus, our viewpoint of the perpetrator should be reframed, delegating the fault to the person, not the tool.\n\t\t\n\t\nWith the release of GPT-4, many professors and students alike need to reconsider its benefits. Professors already recommend YouTube for content help, so why not ChatGPT?\nChatGPT can be a remarkable asset that provides an advantage to disadvantaged students. Since many Penn students come into university with a deep background in their chosen field of study, which they gained from their access to prep schools or private tutors, the bridge between these two groups is substantial. ChatGPT provides a way to somewhat balance the playing field.\n\tFor one, GPT-4\u2019s added feature of uploading PDFs makes it ridiculously simple to ask questions about lecture content, at any time of the day, while tailoring it to your level of understanding, a skill that many professors and teaching assistants lack. As several professors are utterly immersed in their fields and many TAs have an intuitive grasp of the subject, they are often incapable of making complex topics digestible. Unfortunately, there have been many instances where I gave up on asking questions to avoid receiving a convoluted response.\u00a0\nWith ChatGPT, feedback is immediate, allowing students to reflect on areas of improvement in their work, and providing them with mechanisms to improve over time. Why go through the hassle of setting up TA office hours to ask a simple question when ChatGPT can do it instantaneously?\u00a0\nStudents outside of Penn who do not have access to an educational institution with tutoring facilities also stand to attain so much from receiving academic help from ChatGPT. This is due to its similarity to using online services like Khan Academy, though ChatGPT is much more personalized.\nProfessors who reject the idea of incorporating ChatGPT into classrooms have not considered thinking critically of its beneficial uses. Instead, they are content with adhering to traditional practices, foregoing innovation for comfort. On the other hand, students who are against the usage of AI hold themselves to a higher standard for not relying on outside sources \u2014 similar to many Penn students' views of receiving academic help through services like Weingarten tutoring or office hours.

          "title": "Francesco Salamone | Let\u2019s talk about dying!",
          "article_content": "\u201cWhat do your parents do?\u201d someone seriously asked me during Wharton orientation. Fighting my brain's battle between an unforced desire to share and an aversion to the anticipated awkward look, I recognized that I would face a long, interminable moment of apnea trying to explain to the world that I do not have two parents because my dad died. Grief exists, and at Penn, it isolates.\nTo be clear, I do not intend to be a prophet speaking universal truths because loss looks different for everyone, but I hope you will find truth in my words nonetheless. Death is a sensitive topic, not the least because it intertwines with cultural, religious, spiritual, and socioeconomic aspects of our identity. Yet grief is undeniably omnipresent, and Penn is no exception, meaning I am not the first one to write (or talk) about it, nor will I be the last, unfortunately.\n\t\tAlmost 40% of college students have lost a family member or close friend within the last two years. Considering there are 18.58 million college students, that makes us more than 7 million grievers. I guess we are not a minority, are we?\u00a0\nWharton senior Pranavi Karnati lost her father last December after a battle with glioblastoma. She bravely watched him suffer for more than a year and a half, but \u201cdespite the pain he felt, he always managed to make us smile.\u201d She experienced a slower, anticipatory death and described her grief as \u201cisolating.\u201d\n\t\t\t\tSEE MORE FROM FRANCESCO SALAMONE: \ufeffIs Penn about liberal arts or elite jobs?There is no definitively designated place to grieve at Penn. Yes, Student Health and Counseling helps (if you are lucky), but 61% of college counselors in the United States report feeling \u201csomewhat, little, or not comfortable at all\u201d with supporting students primarily on grief. Unlike peer institutions like Princeton that offer grief-focused support groups, Penn lacks such infrastructure. The only comparable program that existed was Actively Move Forward, but it has been inactive since 2019.\nWhat about Philadelphia-based groups? As Karnati shared, before you even get a chance to talk about grief, you may face an identity crisis. \u201cThere are groups for children and groups for adults. What am I? Where are college students supposed to sign up?\u201d\n\tThe result explains why grief feels isolating. Naturally, some prefer to process on their own, but sooner or later, we crave feeling less like an alien and more like we are not the only ones experiencing excruciating pain. And support groups are one easy way to find others who relate.\nOf course, this is only half the problem. Remember, I believe Penn is a detached elite. Having two parents is a privilege: emotionally but interestingly also economically, and substantially so. I cannot blame you for having a privilege you did not choose, but I can and will invite you to reflect on it.\u00a0\nAfter Karnati posted her terrible news, she received several supportive messages: \u201cLmk if you need anything\u201d stood out. She mentioned, \u201cMy loss is making me realize who my true friends really are.\u201d\u00a0\nCan Penn students only support one another through hasty texts with cheap acronyms?\nWe know your \u201cI\u2019m here if you need me\u201d is well-intentioned, but understand that it creates a dilemma by putting the onus of starting the conversation on us, inadvertently burdening the griever even more. The individualistically expeditious culture of Penn is inevitably in direct contrast to the prolonged nonlinear path that grievers experience. At best, Penn students are awkwardly unequipped to support a grieving friend and at worst, fundamentally incapable of slowing down to care and empathize. You can do better.\nLike what? Be present with your friend\u2019s pain, listen with the heart, respect disordered confusion, and discover the gifts of sacred silence over filling words. That is what grief counselor Dr. Alan Wolfelt calls companioning. I wish my friends knew about companionship to ask me about my dad. Ask me what he was like, what he liked to do, what his quirks were. God, just ask me what his name was. When you ask, you are not reminding me that he died (trust me, I know), you are letting me know that you acknowledge that he lived.\nThe truth is I cannot blame them. Part of the matter is institutional and part of it is cultural: Many of us are used to the high school familiarity of knowing at least some family members of our friends. For better or for worse, in college, you are nothing more to others than what you present. And unlike your Canada Goose, you cannot wear your invisible grief when you walk down Locust. What you can wear is a Penn Face and pretend no one died, even with your closest friends, because it is profoundly easier and more tempting than the unfathomable truth.\nSo please, I beg you, next time you come across a griever, think twice before ending the conversation out of discomfort or sending the \u201cI\u2019m here if you need me\u201d text. Think beyond and think deeper. Perhaps take the simplest approach: Sit down with them and see where they will bring you.\n\t\tGet our newsletter, DP Daybreak, delivered to your inbox every weekday morning.If we collectively accept death as a mainstream topic of social dialogue, grief will be easier to handle than to hide. Harvard professor and happiness expert Arthur Brooks says: \u201cGrief does not have to be a private misery and net harm to our lives. We can learn to comprehend it, manage it, and grow from it. And in understanding our own grief, we can help others heal and thrive as well.\u201d\nAfter seven years, I understand my grief, and it is my hope (and Karnati\u2019s recent hope) that these words will help somebody.\nFRANCESCO SALAMONE is a Wharton sophomore from Palermo, Italy.

          "article_content": "This semester, I somehow ended up with four out of my five classes being either directly or indirectly about ethics. As a political science major, I was really excited to take these classes, since whenever people talk about ethics nowadays, it mostly has to do with politics or international relations.\nAt a time when our reality changes so rapidly because of technology, and when we are faced with a number of global challenges, some people have forgotten about the importance of acting morally. Especially at a place like Penn, where everyone seems to be extremely worried about their future and their careers, people often disregard these values when they are caught up by the competitive environment. Because of this, one would think that ethics classes would be extremely beneficial for all, but do they actually contribute to making students more ethical individuals?\n\t\tAccording to my professors, they don\u2019t.\nIn all four ethics classes, my professors started the semester by telling us that ethics classes will not make most of us more ethical. I sat there, listening to all of them, and I just could not understand why they would say something like that. If I wasn\u2019t going to learn anything, what was the point of taking these classes?\n\t\t\t\tSEE MORE FROM ZARA TENA:The urgent need for younger voices in politics\ufeffIt\u2019s okay to be ordinaryThat\u2019s where I was wrong: I have been learning a lot. While perhaps the main goal of ethics classes is not to turn students into more ethical people, they definitely give us the tools we need to critically engage with ethical dilemmas. By taking these classes, I might not become a better person, but they have given me a space where I can explore, discuss, and reflect about where I stand on so many issues and what my beliefs about morality actually are.\nEthics is not a subject that can be forcefully taught through lectures and readings. There is no way that we can sit down for three hours every week and magically become more ethical just because we memorize theories and read long papers written by old white men. The goal of these classes is not to tell us what is \u2018right\u2019 or \u2018wrong,\u2019 \u00a0but to give us the skills to navigate the gray areas in ethical decision making.\n\tThese classes encourage self reflection and personal growth. Even when analyzing big case studies or exploring different theories, students are pushed to question their own values, beliefs, and biases. While this may not guarantee that we will completely transform our moral compasses, the self awareness that comes from these reflections creates a great foundation for understanding why we act the way we do and also invites us to try to understand others.\nThe fact that ethics classes begin with a warning \u2014 that you won\u2019t become more ethical by taking them \u2014 should not stop anyone from giving them a chance. The ability to think critically, understand different values and perspectives, and have the skills to self reflect are essential parts of any college education. They prepare students for the complicated moral dilemmas they might face in their personal and professional lives \u2014 especially when most people at Penn will end up with jobs that are notorious for their ethical scandals!\nZARA TENA is a College sophomore studying political science from Puebla, Mexico.

          "article_content": "How many times have you found yourself in a never-ending cycle of back-and-forth messages, trying to pin down a date for a long overdue catch up with a friend? Every get together begins to feel as if it requires intricate planning and strips away the simplicity of social connection. This routine becomes stifling, lacking spontaneity and authenticity; you\u2019re constrained to coordinating with the same faces in the same places.\u00a0\nThis is what I like to call scheduling fatigue.\u00a0\n\t\tAs a result of this phenomenon, gatherings among friends are beginning to resemble scheduled business meetings, meticulously arranged via tools like When2Meet or synchronized Google Calendars.\nWhile resorting to scheduling may seem like the only viable option to maintain a semblance of social connection, perhaps it's time to embrace the idea of venturing out solo: I\u2019m challenging you to go on an unplanned side quest all by yourself to a third place.\u00a0\n\t\t\t\tMORE FROM LALA MUSTAFA:A nation on defense: Dismantling misinformation against Azerbaijan in the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict\ufeff\ufeffAllow me to explain. Picture the first place as your home and the second as your place of education or work. Now, the third place emerges as a public sphere where individuals congregate, not out of any obligation like in the previously mentioned locations, but, for lack of a more precise term, to simply vibe. It could be the cozy corner of a cafe, a communal park, or even the neighborhood barbershop \u2014 anywhere that\u2019ll allow you to interact with people outside your usual circles.\u00a0\nYet, at many universities like Penn, the concept of a third place seems all but lost as our lives remain restricted to school grounds, causing even our first and second places to converge into one. While spots on campus \u2014 like Stommons, Pret, or the cultural centers in ARCH \u2014 can offer some respite, they often come with the latent pressure of being on the clock. Conversations here revolve around assignments, internships, and the intricacies of Penn culture. The chances of an unexpected encounter dwindle given that most people in attendance will be other Penn students. As we\u2019re cocooned in the Penn bubble, it comes as no surprise that many students spend their four years in Philadelphia without ever fully exploring it.\u00a0\n\tYet, this insulation comes at a cost that extends far beyond what we realize.\u00a0\nIt severs our connection not only from the outside world but also from ourselves. That is, within such limits, our individuality dwindles, reducing us to mere roles influenced by our peers. By excluding ourselves from a wider social sphere, we inhibit opportunities to engage with diverse perspectives, trap ourselves in a cycle of familiarity, and risk leading monotonous lives that pave the way to burnout.\nHowever, in our lives, both intimacy and affiliation with broader communities are essential. While intimacy often stems from our immediate circles, affiliation thrives in third places where spontaneous interactions occur. These spaces facilitate easy contact with new individuals on a regular basis, without the need for prior scheduling. As they consistently offer an opportunity for interaction with others, they end up cultivating the most reliable form of socialization.\u00a0\nSo, if you are keen on exploring new horizons and getting involved in the Philadelphia community, I suggest checking out the many informative articles dedicated to bursting the Penn bubble.\nNevertheless, I want to avoid confining third places to physical locations. They\u2019re more of a mindset, a willingness to embrace spontaneity wherever it may arise. They don't have to be far from campus or require spending money. Instead, third places can be any informal spots you visit \u2014 whether it's your student lounge, the library, or a community center.\u00a0\n\t\tGet our newsletter, DP Daybreak, delivered to your inbox every weekday morning.We often find ourselves caught up in the routines of daily life, clinging to familiar patterns of scheduling and social interaction.

          "title": "Beatriz B\u00e1ez | No closed captioning available",
          "article_content": "Columnist Beatriz B\u00e1ez explains her experience with language fatigue at Penn.On my first day at Penn, I called my father in distress, telling him I needed to move back home and study there as I was going to die alone at this university. My father asked why, and I quickly responded, \u201cI haven\u2019t met anybody in three hours. I have no friends. It\u2019s over for me.\u201d\u00a0\nThat very same night, I went to a New Student Orientation event at Houston Hall. As I nervously paced the floor in my Crocs, I overheard some students speaking Spanish and immediately gravitated toward them. Confessing, \u201cI heard Spanish, and I feel saved,\u201d I ended up meeting three genuine individuals, all from various parts of Latin America. Having arrived in the United States, it felt comforting to hear voices that reminded me of home. This comfort is priceless in such a foreign environment.\n\t\tAll my life, I\u2019ve taken courses in Spanish, spoken Spanish at home, and been berated by my grandmother whenever I spoke too much English. Arriving at Penn, I didn\u2019t anticipate the struggle I would face taking classes taught in English, as I had been lucky enough to have been extensively taught English from a very young age.\nBut speaking in a second language most of the time, even as a fluent speaker, is incredibly draining. Meeting native Spanish speakers at Penn was truly a blessing. However, I have found that some people react adversely to me speaking my primary language. These are not continuous reactions of a high degree, but there have been enough small instances to mark me.\u00a0\n\t\t\t\tMORE ON THIS TOPIC:Students celebrate 40th annual Festival Latinx, honoring Latinx culture on campusLa Casa Latina celebrates 2023 Latinx Heritage Month at PennOn various occasions, I have had Latinx friends say, \u201cLet\u2019s speak English so X person doesn\u2019t feel excluded,\u201d or even resort to English for \u201cconvenience\u201d when we\u2019re alone. For the former, I understand the sentiment. I wouldn\u2019t want someone to be excluded from a conversation in such a way. However, when I\u2019m naturally speaking Spanish, having my speech interpreted as a personal offense is off-putting.\u00a0\nIn one instance, I met a student through a mutual friend on a night out. This friend and I speak fluent Spanish; the person I had just met did not. Throughout the night, I had various conversations with my new acquaintance \u2014 who I found quite amicable \u2014 and my friend. I would naturally speak Spanish with the latter, not thinking much of it. The next morning, my friend told me how the new acquaintance felt I hated them for speaking Spanish in front of them, knowing they didn\u2019t speak the language.\u00a0\n\tI was shocked by the assumption and, in all honesty, a little offended. I found it quite conceited that one would think another person is speaking in their first language to actively exclude them. Speaking in a first language, for me, is purely a relief issue. Although I am fluent in English, after an entire week of speaking it, it can be extremely draining; thus, particularly in a social setting, I don\u2019t want to add to the exhaustion.\u00a0\nIt is more than fine to be curious about what somebody is saying and ask for a translation. However, immediately expressing discomfort upon hearing another language and presuming the other person is talking badly about you is inconsiderate toward them. More often than not, this language switch is for comfort. This was the first of sufficient instances that exposed a pattern in my time at Penn. In another class, I grew close to a few other Spanish-speaking students. One of them continuously suggested we switch back to English for seemingly no valid reason and would reply to any comment of mine in English.\u00a0\nThis harsh reality on campus expands into the club scene. In one instance, a native English speaker attended a club meeting primarily led in Spanish. Within this meeting, if club members asked questions in Spanish, any other members who answered quickly switched to English. Evidently, the intent is to have everybody be able to partake in conversation. However, members within a Spanish-led group should be able to detach from English formalities within club meetings, particularly if the club seeks to embrace Latinx heritage.\u00a0\nSpeaking in my primary language is the greatest manifestation of my culture, particularly since Spanish accents are so diverse throughout Latin America. Having to switch to English not only in academic settings but in seemingly every other sphere of Penn life further disconnects me from the culture I\u2019ve been surrounded by my entire life until now. This applies to any person whose main language isn\u2019t English, not only to Spanish speakers.\u00a0\n\t\tGet our newsletter, DP Daybreak, delivered to your inbox every weekday morning.Penn has students from over 100 countries, with around 19% of the student body being international. If one truly wants to immerse themselves in Penn\u2019s multilingual community, one needs to recognize that a language barrier works both ways. Just as an English speaker may be tired from learning another language, a non-English speaker can be drained from constantly speaking English. It\u2019s crucial to recognize that for the latter, multilingualism surpasses a simple language requirement and spills over to nearly every sector of their life at Penn.\u00a0\nLanguage fatigue is a true reality, especially for individuals who haven\u2019t learned English from a young age. Thus, if somebody within your social group is speaking their first language, which you are not fluent in, it does not give you the right to feel offended or urge them to speak in a tongue you understand. And, if you are a non-native English speaker, as much as you can, \"habla en tu primer idioma y que los dem\u00e1s se ubiquen.\"\nBEATRIZ B\u00c1EZ is a College first year studying mathematics and political science from San Juan, Puerto Rico.

In our instruction at the University of Pennsylvania, we were told to reach for safety and to secure our decadence. So are the students now, but they are not nearly as certain that this is the road they\u2019d really like to walk. The students I knew have already paid that price for that ticket, and their horizons, on a human level, look bleak.\u00a0\n\t\tPhiladelphia is not a college town.

The crisis is deepening, and history is accelerating.\n\t\t\n\t\nFewer illusions are possible for the young mind in Philadelphia, which tempers and sharpens it like metal on metal.

The scramble for acceptance into mediocre clubs and fraternities is insufferable, and the false authority these groups stand on in order to make these judgments is embarrassing.

          "article_content": "At this point, many Penn students have lived the terrible dining stories at a number of halls across campus. While it\u2019s important to discuss the health and sanitary risks associated with some of these concerns, it\u2019s also necessary to break down how this problem factors into students\u2019 academic and mental well-being.\u00a0\nOpening Sidechat every few days to see yet another picture of undercooked meat or hearing horror stories from my friends dissuades me from trekking across campus to eat at many of our dining halls. Oftentimes, I find myself skipping meals or stretching the time out between each one \u2014 until I accept the fact that I\u2019ll be eating the same food I already ate a couple times that week. Does this mean that I\u2019m probably missing out on some of the necessary vitamins or fiber I should be getting daily? Probably.\n\t\tNumerous Penn Dining Wellness emails live in our inboxes with tips on improving digestive health and practicing better healthy habits in our daily lives. Additionally, the official page for Penn Dining boasts awards and recognitions for sustainability and top college dining. However, the pristine and glossy promotional pictures of sandwiches, smoothies, and breakfast bowls tell a completely different story from the reality on campus.\nWith two of the most historical repeat offenders \u2014 Hill House and 1920 Commons \u2014 being the only consistent options available for on campus dining during the weekend, it\u2019s much more convenient to resort to the other retail spots scattered around campus. However, some of these locations are far apart, depending on where you live, and can add additional costs to weekly expenses. \u00a0\n\t\t\t\tSEE MORE FROM HANADI ABDULKADIR:\ufeffPenn should require an African American history courseWhy social media and Palestinian activism goes hand in handAdditionally, for students who are dishing out a hefty sum of money to enroll in the dining plan, going out of their way to seek expensive alternatives takes away money that could\u2019ve been better spent elsewhere. Considering that first years and sophomores are required to pick a dining plan for their first two years at Penn, it\u2019s no wonder that students have consistently called for the food standards to match the high prices of these meal swipes. Ideally, no student should feel like they need to resort to options outside of Penn; rather, outside options should be supplemental to an already quality level of options at all dining halls.\u00a0\nSince coming to Penn, my relationship with food has become much more complex. I need to look twice when picking out a seemingly clean utensil to eat whatever is on my plate or stare extra hard at my salad with suspicion before consuming it. But growing up, food was always a way for me to connect with my family and friends, to bring us back together even when we hadn\u2019t seen each other in a long time. Yet the food at Penn, at its worst, has left me frustrated and succeeded at suppressing my appetite \u2014 something I actually can relate to other students about.\n\tAlthough certain foods are scientifically linked to improving mental clarity and focus, I hesitate in reaching for those vegetables because they don\u2019t look as fresh or appetizing when lined up on display in Kings Court English House. As a result, I look for short-term solutions in coffee, which leaves me feeling tired earlier in the day or exhausted while trying to tackle my assignments at night. In order to meet my immediate deadlines, I prioritize some assignments over others, meaning some classes suffer in academic performance and perpetuate an almost never-ending cycle of playing catch-up. I believe that the root cause of all these problems can be traced back to the lack of decent dining.\u00a0\nThis same sentiment has been echoed by many of my friends and peers. But the dining quality at Penn can be mitigated if the University addresses the root problem. Whether that be promoting clean and sanitary workspaces when handling food or streamlining student complaints to Penn Dining other than through email, the University can restore student faith in the system. When it comes to campus dining, Penn can improve upon our experiences by implementing the changes that students deserve to enjoy, especially at the height of midterm season.\nHANADI ABDULKADIR is a College sophomore studying international relations from Philadelphia.

And yes, Penn is actually active in areas outside of Wharton\u2019s finance programs.\nSo, when Penn Engineering announced its new undergraduate program in artificial intelligence, many of us were enthusiastic about the University\u2019s growing role in the innovation sector: a space thought to be dominated by less business-oriented institutions.\n\t\t\t\tSEE MORE FROM MRITIKA SENTHIL: Removing legacy admissions will align Penn\u2019s actions more closely with its educational missionWhy changing leadership won\u2019t eliminate antisemitism at PennBut Penn\u2019s realization, of possibly its most practical initiative, begs the question: Is the University actually necessary in DevOps? Does sitting in a classroom \u2014 let alone one that\u2019s in the midst of a campus known for its influx of finance bros \u2014 really supersede what can be MacGyvered by a tech junkie with only a laptop, caffeine, and time? I want to give a definite \u201cno.\u201d Otherwise, I would need to hold my classmates and myself accountable for upholding all the exclusivity that comes with attending Penn. And yet, there are a frustrating number of anonymous netizens, D-list journalists, and LinkedIn bards who call Ivy League universities like Penn \u201cout of touch\u201d \u2014 remnants of centuries-old American elitism in an era of bottom-up grassroots movements.\nOne C-suite executive anticipates that \u201cthe best AI engineers and builders won\u2019t graduate Penn Engineering. They'll be global, builders and in the right group chats.\u201d His readers agree, with one commenter further emphasizing that \u201cuniversities cannot keep up with the pace of free market innovation.\u201d When these schools attempt to go against the grain and align with consumer needs, \u201cit genuinely looks embarrassing and out of date.\u201d\n\tIn an environment where the use of AI models is largely democratized, we\u2019re naturally drawn to the trope of a layperson who forgoes bureaucratic systems to channel their intelligence: creating life-changing inventions that would have never come to be under self-serving corporate and political influences. And when ignoring cases of succor \u2014 as mainstream media unfortunately does \u2014 there are many examples of such successes. Bill Gates and Paul Allen, co-founders of Microsoft, were university dropouts. So were Meta Platforms co-founders Mark Zuckerberg and Dustin Moskovitz. As Penn\u2019s over reliance on donors came to light earlier this school year, critics of the upper crust have continued to group Penn with other perpetrators of social stratification. The field of AI is, by nature, continuously evolving. And limiting growth in the discipline to those who can afford, and then succeed in Penn\u2019s Department of Computer and Information Science courses is counterproductive.\nHowever, these narratives misrepresent the intentions of Penn\u2019s AI program.\nTo make a better case for Penn\u2019s AI major, I spoke with Robert Ghrist, Andrea Mitchell Professor and associate dean for undergraduate education at Penn Engineering. He describes how the process of integrating AI in education is similar to the effects of increasing access to music recording and playback technologies. Now, there is \u201cmore music for everyone at much lower prices,\u201d he told me. Nonetheless, \u201cartists at the very top of the industry\u201d are increasingly the benefactors of \u201ca concentration of rewards.\u201d Taylor Swift is, as any current news feed can attest to, perhaps the most prolific embodiment of such phenomena. And professor Ghrist strives to make Penn an incubator of sorts for the \u201cTaylor Swifts of AI\u201d that seek avenues for academic growth, to actually be the \u201cleading edge where the best thrive.\u201d\nAnd to thrive in this discipline, aspiring AI mavens are off course by simply memorizing browser instructions in JavaScript and praying for a tech equivalent of the coveted Goldman Sachs internship. After all, studying AI is a philosophical pursuit: an inquiry into the nature of consciousness and ethics of creating sentient machines. It\u2019s also a political pursuit, for AI poses challenges in regulatory compliance. There are countless possible liabilities for even the most basic ChatGPT input, such as unprotected user data and violations of intellectual property rights. \u00a0\n\t\tGet our newsletter, DP Daybreak, delivered to your inbox every weekday morning.Needless to say, as you might have noticed in my earlier columns, I am not an AI major. I\u2019m not even enrolled in Penn Engineering. Am I, of all students, in the right to quash critics of the Penn AI major when I dropped AP Computer Science in high school (with no regrets)?\nYet, it\u2019s clearly irresponsible to follow the well-intentioned advice from tech capitalists when constant innovation is not particularly ideal for society. Maybe I\u2019m just afraid of a \"Black Mirror\"-esque dystopia, but there is a kind of ominous quality to the idea of highly skilled AI scientists off the reins. Penn, however, is cultivating an ecosystem that nurtures AI talent, albeit not by stifling the next Elon Musk or Sam Altman with red-tape-ridden academics; instead, Penn fosters ethically conscious innovation that addresses complex societal challenges. And so, the fact that I can engage with the Penn curricula across departments has a surprising beauty. The opportunity to become a part of this technological movement \u2014 or, dare I say, revolution \u2014 is the gift of studying AI at Penn.\nMRITIKA SENTHIL is a first year studying management and Russian and east European studies from Columbia, S.C.

          "title": "Akiva Berkowitz | An AI major by any other name ",
          "article_content": "Artificial intelligence is a topic we can\u2019t seem to get enough of. From frequent announcements regarding policies within classrooms to endless professors and visiting scholars weighing in on the unprecedented effect large language models will have on our lives, I\u2019m sure we\u2019ve all discussed to death how revolutionary ChatGPT has become for college students.\u00a0\nMany of us have even had the chance to firmly establish positions on whether the University should embrace the technology wholeheartedly or put in place safeguards to prevent it from eroding the value of a college education, but up until now, the vast majority of conversations have been on a non-technical level.\n\t\tThat all potentially changed in this past month when Penn announced their first Bachelor of Science in Engineering in AI. Thankfully for us, Penn has chosen to launch this interdisciplinary degree at the \u201coptimal time\u201d to \u201ccreate a society where AI isn\u2019t just a tool, but a fundamental force for good to advance society.\u201d But at what cost? To what extent should we be using college as an opportunity to hyperfocus on not just a certain field (computer science), but a field within a field? Majoring in AI panders to the pre-professionalism Penn is known for and removes many of the foundational elements of the field that underlie innovation.\u00a0\nIn an interesting recent LinkedIn post, David Magerman pondered the implications of a university building complete undergraduate curriculums around a \u201cmodern business tool that is a niche application of computer science, diverting students away from a broad education in computer science.\u201d He went on to ask pointedly, \u201cWhat's next? A Bachelor of Arts in Blogging from the Annenberg School? A Wharton BS in Quantitative Trading?\u201d\n\t\t\t\tSEE MORE FROM AKIVA BERKOWITZ:The newsletter is dead\ufeffIsrael under attack: What do you stand for?As a current computer science major, I\u2019ll admit the AI curriculum looks fascinating. There is such an array of eye-catching electives (from Deep Generative Models to Natural Language Processing) that, if I were doing my degree all over again, I suspect I would have been swayed to switch into the major. But as a recently graduated computer and information science friend put it, the degree \u201cseems like the cool parts of CIS\u201d without the heavier basics like operating systems, computer systems, and physics \u2014 building blocks on the entire computer domain. \u00a0\nThe question I ask myself is whether artificial intelligence is really enough of an independent field that it transcends computer science and necessitates its own major. Is the relatively new field of AI established enough, broad enough, and unique enough such that the skills we gain through taking just those mostly career-focused courses today will undoubtedly remain relevant in 30 years and justify the $84,600 a year sticker price? I simply wonder how likely it may be that AI will become so unrecognizable in 20 or even 10 years, given its breakneck pace of innovation, that students may have wished that their majors in college focused on more fundamental elements of the field that innovators keep turning back to for insight.\u00a0\n\tAside from long-term career effectiveness an AI degree would have compared to computer science or electrical engineering, Penn is known for its pre-professional student body, and this new major shows signs of that sentiment leaking into the curriculum as well. In contrast to the Penn Integrates Knowledge professorships that bring in academic leaders who deeply understand multiple fields to better spark insight between them, this new major filters various courses of study to pluck out the elements we find valuable today.\u00a0\nIn this line of thinking, maybe we should consider the true value of a groundbreaking Wharton degree in quant trading that would promise to \u201csculpt the financial moguls of tomorrow\u201d with unparalleled prowess in algorithmic trading strategies and quantitative analysis.\u00a0\nAll this is to say, I immediately understand the value the current AI concentration within the larger CIS curriculum has. And I appreciate the Ph.D. programs that take students to a higher level of understanding, once they\u2019ve taken the time in their undergraduate training to build the broad foundations. I simply remain curious of the true value an AI undergraduate degree offers us as students over other forms of study within the field and the certain level of indulgence in pre-professionalism that it plays into on Penn\u2019s campus. I truly hope that I\u2019m proven wrong.\nAKIVA BERKOWITZ is an Engineering junior studying computer science from Silver Spring, Md.

          "title": "Eric Najera | Penn must take action to enhance the dining experience",
          "article_content": "As busy college students, most of us do not have time to cook our own meals, and if you are anything like me, cooking is far from your forte. The hassle of having to go to the grocery store, cook, and clean can be time consuming and even more difficult when you\u2019re overwhelmed with classes, clubs, and homework. For the many students without access to a kitchen in their dorm, this presents an even bigger challenge. Luckily, college campuses have dining halls! Students simply swipe their card to get access to an all-you-care-to-eat dining experience. Dining halls provide easy access meals to students\u2014but what happens when that food is inedible?\nAs a picky eater, I know that simply because I do not like a dish does not mean it is unsafe to eat, but food with cockroaches and glass is unsafe for anyone. A seemingly obvious underlying assumption in dining is that food is safe to eat. College dining halls should be a place where students go to eat well-cooked, hairless, and insect-free food. However, that is not the case at Penn: There is a lack of responsibility to make sure the food is meeting basic standards for, let alone satisfying, all students.\u00a0\n\t\tMeal plans are far from cheap. For the sticker price, students would expect quality food, but they would be wrong. Both of the first-year student meal plan options cost $6,330, with the maximum amount of swipes being 296. Each meal swipe equates to roughly $17, which is about the same price as a Caniac Combo at Raising Cane's. As previously stated, Penn dining hall food is far from gourmet, and its price is too high for the quality delivered.\u00a0\nExpensive dining plan meals are not unique to Penn, but other Ivy League schools have similar prices for better quality food. Cornell University offers an unlimited meal plan, so students may visit the dining halls as much as they want with a fixed cost of $6,942 for food ranked second-best in the nation. So, for roughly 600 more dollars, Cornell students have access to unlimited meals and substantially better quality dining.\u00a0\n\t\t\t\tSEE MORE FROM ERIC NAJERA: \ufeffWe should be grateful to attend PennPenn clubs should have an assigned faculty member\ufeffAside from price and quality, weekend dining is another struggle. With the popular McClelland Sushi & Market and Houston Market being closed on Saturdays and the other dining halls closing at 8 p.m., food options are limited. Late-night study sessions means having to resort to local food places that remain open, and unlike nearby schools such as Drexel, our dining dollars do not work at off-campus restaurants and out-of-pocket money spent on takeout can add up quickly.\nBefore every school break, Sidechat is flooded with posts of excitement for home-cooked meals. In my classes, when asked what we are excited for, most students reply being able to eat good food. It is not uncommon for college students to miss their home-cooked meals, but when students are excited to actually eat food that is not served alongside insects, it signifies a problem.\n\tWith Penn\u2019s Bon App\u00e9tit contract still in place, we may not know how much Penn can do to change the dining experience. Safe, clean food should not be an unreasonable expectation. In order to enhance a student's experience outside the classroom, Penn must budget for an edible food experience for all students.\nERIC NAJERA is a College sophomore studying history from Rolling Meadows, Ill.

          "title": "Zaid Alsubaiei | Does Penn\u2019s diversity represent its sense of community?",
          "article_content": "We all know the typical \u201ctypes\u201d of high schoolers, the different clich\u00e9s: Where are my nerds at? But, another attribute of student groups that has become increasingly relevant in the 21st century United States is the diverse ethnic makeup of its population. And, frankly, do we as a campus mirror all that comes with that national trend of diversity?\nThink of the friends with whom you often hang out. Then, ask those friends with whom they usually go out. Finally, think of the groups you are a part of, the extracurriculars in which you partake. Notice a pattern?\n\t\t\u201c[D]espite increased opportunity to live and work in mixed-race settings, Americans remain racially segregated in their friendship patterns,\u201d a study published by the National Institutes of Health found. \u201cSpatial racism, cultural encapsulation, and personal choice are contributing factors for patterns of same-race friendships.\u201d\u00a0\nThis pattern seems to reflect the divisions present in Penn\u2019s social scene as well. Despite coming from all sorts of backgrounds across the world, the University\u2019s students appear to have unconsciously adopted a policy of self segregation. In other words, we like to \u201cstick to our own\u201d by socializing with others to whom we relate to on a cultural, ethnic, or religious basis. So, regardless of Penn\u2019s efforts to integrate people of differing experiences and beliefs, there still remains a degree of resistance by individuals themselves to cross those racial or cultural lines.\n\t\t\n\t\nAs a result, the potential for diversity of thought is threatened. A narrow mindset develops within these groups that students pledge to, and they effectively act as echo chambers that exacerbate already crippling political polarization. We relate to each other less, rely on our \u201cown\u201d more, and become less tolerant of the views, and thus experiences, of those who do not necessarily look, think, or speak like us.\nThis kind of thinking \u2014 whether manifested in the form of race, religion, or otherwise \u2014 has led to serious tension at times and enabled a distorted view of certain communities and how they experience Penn. I attribute part of that thinking not to the identity groups we are a part of, but to how much we value them over who we are as individuals.\n\tHomogenous communities definitely have their place in the college experience: They help ease our transition when we first arrive at Penn, and their role cannot be replaced. I say this as an international student myself, who had a hard time acclimating to an entirely different culture and, most radically, diet. Nonetheless, we should treat these organizations as an aid to finding belonging on campus, not a substitute for individual thought and expression.\nHowever, none of this means individuals can\u2019t agree or always need to separate themselves from the group. The use of a large, collective voice can benefit our campus much more than we realize. What is important to note is that there lies a clear distinction between acknowledging the views of others and forcing ourselves to accept those views for the sake of conformity.\nThere is nothing wrong with disagreeing with the majority, whether it is one against two or one against a nation (though some may try to tell you otherwise). As long as you are respectful and driven by a desire to learn rather than defend, there are no limits on what perspective you may question. So, challenge your beliefs, reevaluate your viewpoint, challenge that of others (no matter who they are), and then reevaluate yourself again. It\u2019ll be hard at first, to express your precise, genuine thoughts without fear. But, remember that you\u2019re not alone (I struggle sometimes myself) and that it\u2019s a process you won\u2019t always get right.\n\t\tGet our newsletter, DP Daybreak, delivered to your inbox every weekday morning.The hardest part of breaking out of groupthink, after realizing it, is talking about it. My advice? Take the plunge and never look back. The next time you are in a group and the majority agrees with an idea you don\u2019t like, let it be known. Talk about it and explain why you think the way you do. Don\u2019t worry if some get offended or others simply do not agree; it is normal and, in fact, expected.\u00a0\nNever forget that disputes you engage in are an opportunity, not a challenge, and our differences are enlightening, not threatening. Only then will we begin to understand and appreciate each other more as unique actors in a truly historic community.\nZAID ALSUBAIEI is a College first year studying economics from Al-Khobar, Saudi Arabia.

          "article_content": "I downloaded Sidechat this fall after my friends sent me too many screenshots of funny memes or jokes posted on the anonymous app. I figured that doing so would simply remove the middleman. I was already being exposed to the same jokes, memes, comments and judgements as those on the app anyway \u2026 right?\u00a0\nIn December, I returned home for reading days and fell into an easy pattern of studying. Nothing I did was wildly exciting or social, but I instead found myself enjoying the routine and satisfaction of productivity. During my study breaks, I would scroll on Sidechat \u2014 and from the comfort of my home, I felt myself spiraling into anxious dread about returning to Penn. Each time I opened the app, I was faced with a barrage of posts all echoing the same sentiment: Penn is awful and depressing. Without a second thought, I accepted those posts as fact, and in doing so, I allowed Sidechat to have more power than it deserves. In other words, I subscribed to the complaining culture that is pervasive on Sidechat.\u00a0\n\t\tUsing Sidechat, especially without intentional thought, is a way of looking at Penn through hypercritical glasses. Perhaps this is because negativity has been normalized and cynicism gets more upvotes. To some extent, this pessimistic messaging is diluted with the insertion of mildly entertaining memes or jokes, but the result is still the same. With each scroll, Sidechat is perpetuating a defeatist perspective of Penn.\u00a0\nSo, I arrived back at Penn to take my final exam: openly unhappy about returning to what I thought would be a bleak campus as a result of discourse on Sidechat. But to my surprise, it was not horrific, and I was able to enjoy my weekend of studying just as I had my week at home. The sheer volume of disheartening posts on Sidechat had clouded my perspective and ability to see the best in the situation. Sure, I was becoming one with a Huntsman GSR while others were at home enjoying break, but on the other hand, I was with my friends and able to have a sleepy campus all to myself.\n\t\t\t\tAs is the case with most other social media platforms, Sidechat is consumed passively and without a second thought \u2014 it\u2019s used to pass time, curb boredom, and satiate our addictions to our phones. And yet, students are absorbing and internalizing content more quickly than they can truly digest it.\u00a0\nGiven the bandwagon culture on Sidechat, users often build off of one another, creating a chaotic, and often dismal, echo chamber that does not truly represent life at Penn. Whether or not college is the best four years of your life, it is at least what you make of it, and Sidechat enables students to feel like victims of an unknown cause. For those who are actually struggling, Sidechat acts not as a productive outlet, but rather as a meta ether that provides no remedy other than the satisfaction that others are unhappy too.\u00a0\n\tSince winter break, I have in fact deleted Sidechat and am all the better for it. I still get sent the best and the brightest jokes by my friends, but I am no longer overwhelmed by unsolicited complaints on an hourly basis. Without Sidechat, my thoughts on the housing lottery, the floods in the Quad, and upcoming midterms are completely my own. Deleting Sidechat may not be for everyone, but it\u2019s imperative for those who chose to use Sidechat to take a more critical view of what is being circulated and evaluate whether or not they are benefiting from it. It may just change the way they see Penn.\u00a0\nELIZA CARROLL is a College first year studying international relations and art history from Greenwich, Conn.

          "title": "Cathy Li and Liala Sofi | History can\u2019t repeat itself; stand with Chinatown",
          "article_content": "Students for the Preservation of Chinatown protested outside the Board of Trustees meeting held at the Inn at Penn on Mar. 3, 2023. \nA few weeks ago, the streets of Chinatown came to life with firecrackers and lion dances ringing in the year of the dragon. As you walk through the brightly colored 40-foot paifang \u2014 known to most as Chinatown\u2019s Friendship Gate \u2014 you enter into a cultural oasis that has stood strong in the heart of Philadelphia for nearly 150 years. Beyond this fixture, Chinatown serves as a home to nearly 3,000 residents and numerous family-owned businesses, restaurants, shops, and community organizations. Whether you are going to Ken\u2019s Seafood Restaurant for a fun night out or Heng Fa for groceries, Chinatown feels like home.\u00a0\nUnfortunately, this community has been under constant attack for decades and is once again facing the threat of displacement and gentrification from a plan to develop an arena for the Philadelphia 76ers merely a block away. We firmly stand with the Students for the Preservation of Chinatown and urge you to do the same. \u00a0\n\t\tSince the early 1900s, Chinatown has been a victim of gentrification often driven by predatory infrastructure projects. In 1932, the construction of subway infrastructure at Ridge and Eighth streets \u2014 and the subsequent development of the Vine Street Expressway from 1957 to 1991 \u2014 resulted in the destruction of buildings and severe divisions within the community. Bringing in noise and pollution, the expressway eroded neighborhoods and people's quality of life. This was not Chinatown's sole battle, however, as it also faced multiple proposals of developments for a federal prison in 1992, a baseball stadium in 2000, and a casino in 2008.\u00a0\nThe story of Philadelphia's Chinatown mirrors other Chinatowns across the nation. Amid the 1994 fiscal crisis in Washington, D.C., then-Washington Wizards owner Abe Pollin negotiated a deal for the downtown Capital One Arena, where the city covered pre-development costs to acquire and demolish properties. Entrepreneurs in Washington's Chinatown voiced concerns about prices of real estate skyrocketing and parking impacts on businesses in the area. A decade later, most Chinese residents were forced to move out due to unaffordable housing. The parking shortage led to the closure of the last Chinese grocery store, accelerating the decline of the Chinese American population in the area to fewer than 400 residents today. Ironically, as D.C.\u2019s arena now relocates to the suburbs, the community is left behind, having endured irreversible destruction while in the midst of its recovery from the pandemic.\u00a0\n\t\t\t\tMORE FROM LIALA SOFI AND CATHY LI:Liala Sofi | The hypocrisy of billionaire philanthropistsCathy Li | Philadelphia\u2019s changing tastesIn New York\u2019s Chinatown, threats of displacement and economic insecurity also loom high. In 2021, the Museum of Chinese in America accepted a donation of $35 million in support of a borough-based jail complex which would displace Chinese American working-class people in the area. On top of that, its board executives were connected to the closing of the last unionized restaurant, beloved Jing Fong banquet hall, and construction of luxury towers that are actively raising rent and real estate taxes in the area.\nIn Philadelphia, the current 76Place project is being developed by 76 DevCo, an initiative by 76ers managing partners Josh Harris, David Blitzer, and David Adelman. Adelman is at the forefront of the construction of the arena and has promised not to displace the residents or businesses in Chinatown, but his past actions speak louder than his current words. Adelman works closely with Brett Altman, who also owns the University City Townhomes, and was a key figure behind the demolition and end of affordable housing in the West Philadelphia area that was previously known as the \"Black Bottom.\u201d This constant cycle of displacing residents and communities that have lived in the area for generations must end, and we must be the voice to make this happen.\n\tDevelopers of the project have stated that the arena will \u201cserve as a model for an equitable & inclusive community,\u201d yet there is not a single mention of Chinatown in the proposal. Efforts to ensure communities can benefit from this project read as empty promises when nearly 95% of residents, business owners, and visitors oppose the arena\u2019s construction.\nMany questions posed by residents have also gone unanswered by 76 DevCo. How will restaurants and small businesses in the surrounding area be protected? Who will clean the streets after huge events?\u00a0\nPreserving Philadelphia's architectural heritage demands careful consideration in urban development, but the development of the arena does the exact opposite \u2014 jeopardizing accessible low-income and senior housing complexes, healthcare clinics, and schools for children.\nPenn has direct ties to the developers in the area, and students should be cognizant of the situation. Adelman currently sits on Penn Medicine Board of Trustees and is the CEO of Campus Apartments, which houses many Penn students off-campus. But more importantly, Penn students are directly and indirectly involved in the Chinatown community, whether that be Penn Lions performing all throughout the city for Lunar New Year, or student groups like SPOC organizing initiatives to honor traditions celebrating the multi-ethnic communities that reside there.\u00a0\nDespite what greedy developers may suggest, Chinatown is not an ethnic theme park but a home. It\u2019s more than just a place to eat, it\u2019s a support network and a cultural hub for immigrants and visitors alike.\nIn the face of ongoing threats, Chinatown has demonstrated remarkable resilience and activism, advocating for the needs of all diverse communities of color that are integrated into the cultural fabric of our city. The next time you are in Chinatown, take a look around at all the place has to offer. Venture into Ebisu for some home decor and enjoy a Mochinut donut as you shop. Come by Dae Bak for soul-nourishing Korean barbecue. The opportunities to support your favorite restaurants and local businesses are endless.\nPlease don't turn a blind eye to what is happening outside the Penn bubble. Pay attention to what SPOC and other organizers are doing in the fight for the preservation of Chinatown. Educate yourself on what is going on in Chinatowns across the country. If you can, participate in programming like Crane Chinatown Community Center art exhibitions or Show Your Love for Chinatown events to learn more about the challenges facing the neighborhood. Sign petitions. \u00a0\nAdorned with dragon motifs, and gorgeous ornamental roof tiles, the Friendship Archway is not only an architectural masterpiece, but a labor of love \u2014\u00a0created for community by community. The engineers and artisans from Tianjin, China \u2014 Philadelphia\u2019s sister city \u2014 came together with residents and the city of Philadelphia to fund and invest in Chinatown, and you should too.\u00a0\nThe next time you walk through the gate, remember that the fight for Philadelphia\u2019s Chinatown, and Chinatowns everywhere, is not over.

The former president of Harvard, Claudine Gay, was ousted in part due to plagiarism concerns, and Business Insider found that former MIT professor Neri Oxman (the wife of billionaire Bill Ackman, who led the campaign against Gay) \u201cstole sentences and whole paragraphs from Wikipedia, other scholars and technical documents in her academic writing.\u201d\n\t\tTo be clear, I believe that academic dishonesty at Penn \u2014 going against community standards that your professor has explicitly outlined \u2014 is unacceptable, and that we should be doing more to penalize and prevent it.\nNevertheless, we must also acknowledge that academic dishonesty is understandable, in that we can piece together students\u2019 rationales when they do cheat, and even sympathize with them in some cases.\n\t\t\t\tSEE MORE FROM CAROLINE MAGDOLEN:\ufeffThe Rat Kings of PennThere\u2019s no better time for climate education\ufeffTo dissuade academic dishonesty, we employ sayings like, \u201cIt will only hurt you in the long run to cheat,\u201d or \u201cYou\u2019re taking advantage of other students who've completed their work fairly.\u201d This is true in some circumstances. If you\u2019re an aspiring quant and you\u2019re asking ChatGPT to calculate all of the derivatives on your MATH 1400 homework, it\u2019s going to show: First in your exams for the class, then in every math class you take thereafter, and especially in your future career. And if MATH 1400 is curved, your dishonest success capitalizes on the honest failures of others \u2014 not cool.\nBut this is not true in all cases. Jane* was a first year in her spring term when she was taking CIS 1210: Data Structures and Algorithms \u2014 a famously challenging CIS course \u2014 with Rajiv Gandhi, a famously challenging professor.\u00a0\n\tShe cheated on her coding assignment late into the semester, and as per the professor\u2019s policy, received a -300/100 on the submitted homework and zeros on all previously submitted homework, receiving a D as her final grade in the course.\nBut Jane believes that what is more important to her story is not what happened, but why it happened.\u00a0\n\u201cWhat drove me to make a bad decision? Why are [these classes] so infamous? It\u2019s because of notorious policies where you cannot collaborate on many assignments. You are given long problem sets to do, on your own, each week, with desperate students in office hour queues that are two to four hours long. Many times, you will go to the TA and not get a clear answer. It is a profoundly isolating situation, particularly for freshmen just entering college, and that\u2019s what drives well-meaning people to cheat.\u201d\nBased on my conversation with Jane, it seemed that she felt isolated at the time and was struggling to reach out for the support that she needed, both in CIS 1210 and at Penn as a whole. And given the limited support Jane could receive from TAs and her instructor, backtracking her friend\u2019s code felt more conducive to her learning than doing nothing.\nJane expressed a lot of remorse over what happened, and said that she still has a lot of respect for Rajiv, maintaining a good relationship with him to this day. She was also grateful that Rajiv was willing to handle this internally, since a low grade in the class looks better than a formal statement on her transcript, detailing her violation of academic integrity.\n\u201cI deserved to be punished harshly,\u201d Jane said. \u201cBut the collaboration policies of these introductory courses, and the punishment I received, wrecked my self-esteem and my early college experience. I felt that there was no way out.\u201d\nAccording to Jane, Rajiv's philosophy is to \"let go of your grades early: the sooner you stop caring about your GPA and start caring about learning, the better.\" She agrees with this philosophy, especially since he curves his courses generously, but sees this as out of touch with the realities of many Penn students.\nAfter students have prioritized perfecting their grades and resumes (and have been praised for it) in high school, those habits won\u2019t get undone overnight. Even at Penn, there are many institutions and accolades that continue to reward \u201cperfect\u201d performance over pursuing difficult academic disciplines, experimenting, and invariably messing up sometimes.\nFrankly, for a pre-med student in computer science (a track which Jane was considering at the time), the adage that \u201ccheating will hurt you in the long run\u201d skill-wise doesn\u2019t hold much water. The skillset of a future doctor and a software engineer just don\u2019t overlap enough. What can hurt a pre-med in the long run is a low GPA.\nAnd while there are some students for whom projects, internships, and technical interviews will get them a lot further in guaranteeing their success, this is not true for everyone. For many preprofessional students who may want to challenge themselves with a major or minor in CIS, they risk getting shut out of the study altogether.\nWhat frustrates me most about this entire situation is not that such harsh action was taken, but that it appears ineffective in tackling the issue at hand. If a student wanted to cheat, they could just take CIS 1600 or CIS 1210 during a different semester, when a different instructor was in charge and penalties were anecdotally known for being less harsh.\nWhile Jane\u2019s actions were clearly wrong, I can\u2019t help thinking that she was just the unlucky example that had to face the music, and she said as much in our interview: \u201cEveryone cheats in this class. You don\u2019t survive [CIS 1600 or CIS 1210] without talking to people, it just depends on whether you get caught. That doesn\u2019t make cheating okay, but it does mean that we need to rethink how these courses operate.\u201d\nSo, what can we do so that not everyone cheats?\nThis is a complex question, and there is no easy answer. It is crucial that as we frame the issue of academic integrity violations, we look at both the violations themselves and the root motivations that drive them \u2014 these actions are not taking place in a vacuum.\u00a0\nAcademic integrity violations these days are, to an extent, simply easier to commit. ChatGPT has led to a surge in \u201cunfair advantage\u201d violations. And even before generative AI, the pandemic had uprooted our usual test-taking environment. Now that classes are in person again, we no longer need to have take-home or open-Internet exams, but these still persist in some classes, and are easier to cheat on. Penn, given its history of fraudulent alumni, isn\u2019t going to be a place where professors can blindly trust students to refrain from cheating when presented with the option, so professors should take some responsibility for leveling the playing field in the classroom too.\u00a0\nJulie Nettleton, the executive director of Penn\u2019s Center for Community Standards and Accountability (CSA), relayed over email that CSA already works closely with schools and centralized resources at Penn to discuss how to proctor exams, and with faculty to discuss exams, syllabi language, and classroom policies.\nWhat constitutes a violation itself is currently not standard across classes, or even across different sections of the same class. How to handle a concern of academic integrity falls to the professor first \u2014 this is how Jane completed CIS 1210 with a lower grade, rather than a formal sanction from the CSA. It makes sense to delegate this responsibility to professors: It is more efficient than having the CSA handle every case, and professors should have the freedom to decide what constitutes cheating in their classrooms.\nHowever, this does open the door to students deliberately choosing sections of a course with professors that have more relaxed academic integrity policies. Conversely, some professors can be overly harsh, to the point where they are acting unfairly towards their students.\u00a0\nJill*, another student that I interviewed for this article, was falsely accused by her professor of collaborating on her final exam with her peers. At the start of winter break, the professor sent a class-wide email imploring those who worked together on the take-home exam to turn themselves in or have the matter escalated. Jill recalls that for students that turned themselves in, the professor lowered their grades accordingly \u2014 everyone else was reported to the CSA.\nIn the end, Jill\u2019s name was cleared, but she was assigned a case manager that seemed to have assumed she was guilty by default. As the case progressed, many of the details that the professor used to build the case against her appeared superfluous \u2014 for example, she and her friends had all rounded to the same decimal place in their work. Jill suspects that the escalation may have been personal: she had previously asked the professor, on behalf of the class, if he could make changes to his teaching style to facilitate learning.\nIt seems wrong to me that a professor could accuse a student and cause such extensive stress when in the end, Jill turned out to be innocent. It reminded me of some other methods that professors use to catch students cheating, such as Turnitin\u2019s flawed AI detector.\nPart of the solution to rampant academic dishonesty may also lie in expanding our vocabulary to discuss the issue, as John McWhorter pointed out in The New York Times. A class-wide cheating ring, direct plagiarism of original ideas from a paper as one\u2019s own, and copying a line of someone\u2019s code all constitute academic dishonesty, but range broadly in terms of severity and \u201cease of catching.\u201d However, this is rarely reflected in academic integrity policies.\u00a0\nIt can be awkward to suggest that some forms of dishonesty are worse than others, and more awkward still to draw the line between different punishments for different violations, but we must still have these conversations.\u00a0\nWhat should constitute dishonesty at all? When speaking with Jane, she would often circle back to how isolating it was to work alone on her assignments as a first year in introductory computer science courses, particularly as a woman in STEM. Every day, she would walk out of class \u201cfeeling way worse about [her]self.\u201d Now exploring chemistry, physics, and biology courses, she greatly appreciates the change in her academic environment, where students are encouraged to openly collaborate. The grade medians in chemistry are similar to those in CIS (which is to say, not great), but Jane is not as stressed as she was in CIS 1210, since she studies with her friends, and they can struggle and ask for help together.\u00a0\nWhile it was dishonest of Jane to copy code when it was against CIS 1210 policy, perhaps CIS majors and minors would learn more from the course if they were in a more collaborative environment to begin with. Jane has suggested that CIS 1210 should find a middle ground where students can learn from each other, but not be overly reliant on collaboration to perform well on exams.\u00a0\nShe also argues that there should be more opportunities for students to admit to academic dishonesty \u2014 through a friend at Stanford, she heard that at the end of a computer science class, students can select the assignments they have cheated on and receive a negative score on them, or risk facing more uncertain penalties if they are later caught.\u00a0\n\u201cThis policy gives people a second chance to do the right thing, and I do believe that you learn from an experience if you own up to it,\u201d Jane said.\nDeliberations over how best to address academic dishonesty can go on without end, but unfortunately this column must do just that. So here, I want to leave you with a reminder of what I said at the beginning: Academic dishonesty is unacceptable, but it is also understandable.\n\t\tGet our newsletter, DP Daybreak, delivered to your inbox every weekday morning.The hard, but necessary, solution to \u201ceveryone cheating\u201d is taking a good look at the stories behind academic dishonesty, and listening to the students involved with sympathy.

          "title": "Jack Lakis | What we can learn from Penn\u2019s college ranking",
          "article_content": "Last fall, a plethora of new results from U.S. News & World Report, Wall Street Journal, and Forbes elevated Penn in their national college rankings. Nearly every list places Penn among the top 10, some going as far as placing the University among the top five. This universal growth resulted from a key change in most of these sources\u2019 metrics: greater consideration given to postgraduate salaries.\nPenn famously has one of the highest-earning alumni bodies in the country. Starting salaries for Penn graduates are often considered the highest in the Ivy League. By mid-career, the average Penn alum is raking in $165,000 annually, while the national average for a college graduate caps out at $74,000.\n\t\tPenn draws a great deal of prestige from its potential to produce high earners, which is a direct result of our school\u2019s preprofessional culture. Nearly 50% of all Penn graduates enter one of two career fields: consulting or finance. This pipeline allows most Penn alumni to matriculate into high-paying jobs shortly after graduation.\nI\u2019m usually a defender of preprofessionalism. It\u2019s crucial that Penn graduates are able to find good jobs, and high salary potential is an immense advantage. But those jobs aren\u2019t everything. Many universities are making gains in rankings and name recognition based on alumni outcomes in public service careers.\n\t\t\t\t\ufeffSEE MORE FROM JACK LAKIS:\ufeffDo we all hate Penn?Staying focused after Magill's resignation\ufeffFor example, Harvard University boasts about its eight presidential alumni. However, when 1968 Wharton graduate Donald Trump was elected president, Penn mostly ignored his history with the school. Given his proximity to controversy and his unconventional political history, Penn\u2019s bump in prestige was limited by Trump\u2019s election. Our second closest claim to the White House is the University\u2019s relationship with President Joe Biden and the opening of the Penn Biden Center. I argue that this is as far as Penn\u2019s ties to the presidency will go. Nowadays, Penn\u2019s laser focus on professional development might repel students who will one day have presidential potential.\nComparable institutions to Penn have high-earning graduates and prestigious placements throughout the government, nonprofit sector, and the advocacy space. For example, Georgetown University feeds graduates into congressional offices and many Fulbright programs. Princeton University also regularly features its flashy roster of graduates in powerful political offices. These universities maintain a strong presence in the private sector but are also actively represented in government positions.\n\tIn these examples, the institution itself sponsors an undergraduate school dedicated to public service. At Georgetown, it\u2019s the School of Foreign Service, while at Princeton the role is filled by the School of Public and International Affairs.\nI propose that Penn follow suit and create a fifth undergraduate school dedicated to public affairs. This new school could absorb Penn\u2019s wildly popular social science programs, like PPE (Philosophy, Politics and Economics), Political Science, and Economics. Currently, most students in these majors are scooped up by consulting firms and investment banks. If these students were given an intentional focus on service and social responsibility, perhaps they could feel empowered to use their degrees in a more meaningful way.\nThe least Penn can do is expand its current effort to bridge the gap between social science degree seekers and careers in government and nonprofits. It\u2019s crucial that our student body actively engages with the robust policy infrastructure that Penn has already made available: Civic House, Perry World House, opportunities like Penn in Washington, and extracurricular engagements offered by the Government and Politics Association. From what I\u2019ve seen, these resources are underutilized at Penn. By snubbing them, Penn students are working against the general interests of the University to gain prestige.\n\t\tGet our newsletter, DP Daybreak, delivered to your inbox every weekday morning.Besides, it's about more than just rankings. We have the potential to empower our students to become leaders in society. TIME Magazine ranks Penn as the third-best college for aspiring leaders. However, the article states its rationale for this placement as a concentration of graduates in business careers. Other chart-topping schools on this list were noted for their programs in law, medicine, and more.\nUltimately, private sector homogeneity marks one of Penn\u2019s key weaknesses. As we move forward, Penn has a duty to educate leaders in more than one field. If Penn strengthened its programs in civic engagement, more graduates would be inclined to pursue roles in government and could elevate Penn\u2019s cultural stature. We should be known for more than salaries. We can do more than business.\nJACK LAKIS is a College first year studying political science from Kennesaw, Ga.

          "title": "Mia Vesely | Black Penn is vibrant this month and every month",
          "article_content": "As of late, most of my columns have focused on things I take issue with: Whether it\u2019s Liz Magill\u2019s resignation and the threats to free speech on campus, or the lack of racial diversity in Panhellenic sororities. I haven't highlighted the things that I truly appreciate and, more specifically, the places in which I\u2019ve found community at Penn.\nLast February, I argued that Black history is important for everyone. Education surrounding Black people, their lives, and their contributions should be integrated into the standard curriculum. Black Penn shows up and shows out every month, but this month in particular, there are many events and ways that Penn student organizations uplift the community and come together.\u00a0\n\t\tIt would be impossible to touch on all of these amazing events and their impacts, but I\u2019d like to paint a picture of some of these groups and their initiatives during this month and beyond. Planning for these events takes months. For example, when Descendants of Afro-Americans at Penn (DAAP) \u2014 a club founded just last year \u2014 put on their first-ever gala on Feb. 1 to kick off the month, you better believe that the event was well-planned and executed.\u00a0\nThe gala \u2014 Red Carpet For A Cause \u2014 supported the Sickle Cell Disease Association of America's Philadelphia and Delaware Valley Chapter. The night included catered food, live performances from student groups like The Inspiration, wonderful community, and beautiful decor\u2014even including an ice sculpture of the DAAP logo. Over $1,700 was raised in support of the foundation.\n\t\t\t\tSEE MORE FROM MIA VESELY:\ufeffI dropped sorority rush and I\u2019m gladFirst Liz Magill, next free speechWhen asked about the impacts of the event, College sophomore and DAAP founding member Clarke Dickens said, \u201cWe wanted to bring the community together for a great cause, especially a cause that affects a lot of African Americans and Black people more broadly.\u201d\nSickle cell disease occurs in about one in every 365 Black babies born in the United States. The percentage of Black people who carry the trait is even higher, with one in 13 Black babies being born as carriers.\n\tDickens is not just involved with DAAP, but is also on the boards for QBlack and Shea Collective.\nThese clubs are all part of something commonly dubbed \u201cBlack Penn,\u201d which focuses on so many different aspects of identity. From cultural organizations like Penn African Student Association (PASA), to preprofessional organizations like Black Wharton and the Black Pre-Law Association (BPLA), to community service organizations like the NAACP, all of these organizations put an emphasis on service both inside the Penn community and out.\u00a0\nFor example, Campus Curlz \u2014 a club I serve on the board of \u2014 is, at first glance, a club centered around uplifting natural hair and embracing positivity. \u00a0But underlying hair mask making events and movie nights, there is a strong commitment to service. Just this month, the community service committee held an event where we made Valentine\u2019s Day cards for senior citizens at Mercy Life West Philadelphia.\nService by board members is a requirement to be part of funding organizations like UMOJA \u2014 the umbrella funding organization for Black clubs \u2014 and even beyond that, many clubs center service in every activity they partake in. Whether you\u2019re on the board of a club or not, there are many service opportunities available and encouraged.\nWhen asked what they wish people knew about Black Penn, Dickens said, \u201cClubs should make an effort to include grad students, it makes all the difference. I\u2019m able to say, \u2018This is what I would look like coming here for grad school,\u2019 and it can even offer opportunities for mentorship.\u201d\nWhat seems to drive Black Penn is first and foremost the students, then the supportive and involved faculty, as well as the local partnerships and opportunities the clubs find, build, and pursue for themselves. Many members of the DAAP board are native to Philadelphia, so that makes their work even more personal.\nWhile Black students do take initiative to realize what they need and create the spaces they want to see, there is so much room for improvement on behalf of Penn: whether it\u2019s stratifying the way funding is given to these clubs \u2014 they often can\u2019t fund silverware in UMOJA meetings if it can be provided elsewhere \u2014 or improving the cultural spaces available to students (we were promised the ARCH \u2018building,\u2019 not the ARCH \u2018basement\u2019). In months like February, Penn aims to spotlight their Black students. I just wish this recognition of the incredible community Black students forged for themselves, when they initially didn\u2019t see it on campus, came year-round.\n\t\tGet our newsletter, DP Daybreak, delivered to your inbox every weekday morning.Events like DAAP's gala happen every month, and it\u2019s important not to understate the role these organizations play in making Penn a welcoming and accepting place for students from marginalized backgrounds.\nI was happy to see Faces of Black Penn \u2014 a Black-run publication \u2014 highlighted in the DP last week. I hope people continue to uplift the work of these student groups going forward and make space to give all students their roses.

          "title": "Bernadine Kumi | I joined a sorority and I\u2019m glad",
          "article_content": "I\u2019ll be honest: I was not a fan of Greek life when I first got to Penn. My perception of Greek life was influenced by growing up in the South, mainly in suburban Georgia. This included a sorority scene of girls with fake spray tans and little to no personality. The images of sorority girls from the University of Georgia and Alabama screamed no diversity, which made me wary of joining a sorority at Penn. Being a First-Generation, Low-Income (FGLI) student made me especially hesitant. Even more so, coming from a Ghanaian household, the notion of a sorority was immediately dismissed as something against our Christian values. Thus, during my first year, I knew I would never, and I mean never, join a sorority.\u00a0\nHowever, by the beginning of sophomore year, my mindset began to change. After a year on campus, I had found a solid community of a small group of friends. But beyond that, I felt that I did not really know anyone. I couldn\u2019t name more than 20 people in my grade. Penn is known for being a networking school, and the \u201cSocial Ivy,\u201d so I began to question just how much I had taken advantage of that. That, along with most of the underclassmen party scene revolving around fraternities, made the idea of rushing even more appealing.\u00a0\n\t\tSo while most people were beginning their sophomore year with the friends they already had, I began to look for additional friends. My twin sister, who also goes to Penn, and I began attending open rush events, talking to sophomores in sororities, and involving ourselves in more social events. Over the next few months, my days consisted of talking to many girls, going to dinners, and putting myself out there in a way that I had been hesitant to do before. I made new friends, met fellow sophomores also in search of a bigger community, and found myself loving the idea of joining a sorority.\u00a0\nBut what made me even more eager was just how inclusive and diverse sororities were at Penn, more so than I had been expecting\u2014especially the off-campus sorority I ended up joining, OAX. I was still wary about rushing, but as soon as I got to the first event, I immediately felt comfortable. There were girls with different interests, passions, economic backgrounds, and personalities. Not a single conversation felt forced. Every girl I met had a unique and authentic story, and I felt like I could talk to them for hours.\n\t\t\t\tSEE MORE FROM BERNADINE KUMI:\ufeffDining hall workers at Penn Hillel demand better treatment from UniversityI was especially captivated by BLOAX (Black OAX), a community within OAX that includes fellow girls of Ghanaian descent and other Black girls who provided me with guidance on navigating Penn as a Black woman. OAX also has other smaller communities, such as LatinOAX and RainbOAX. Being able to find other people with similar backgrounds made the choice to join a sorority that much easier.\u00a0\nAs a FGLI student and Questbridge scholar, the idea of paying high dues out of my minimal work paychecks every month was unfathomable. I knew that joining a sorority would pose another financial burden, and even though I was loving the OAX community, the idea of paying dues scared me. Yet once again, OAX and other sororities surprised me with their understanding and financial transparency. They worked with me to develop an affordable monthly payment plan so that I, like every other girl interested in rushing, could also enjoy being in a sorority.\u00a0\n\tSince the morning of Bid Day when I got \u201cthe call,\u201d I know that I truly made the right decision by joining a sorority, for not only my social life but my professional life too. This past fall, I was able to land a summer internship in Los Angeles with the help of my grand-big. I was also able to prepare for my interview with girls in my sorority, who gave me the confidence I needed to land the opportunity. As a Black woman and FGLI student, I have truly benefited from joining Greek life. I hope students who are hesitant to rush, just as I once was, will see my experience and how transformative it can be. I hope others \u2014 whether they are Black women, FGLI students, or just Penn students in search of a greater community \u2014 can do the same.\nBERNADINE KUMI is a College junior studying political science and legal studies and history from Roswell, Ga.

          "title": "Jessey Shin | \u201cWhy is your pre-major advisor so much better than mine?\u201d",
          "article_content": "Columnist Jessey Shin explores the problem of disparate advising quality in the College and argues \nfor a more standardized experience.\u201cMy advisor lied to me?\u201d\nI remember someone saying this to me in complete disbelief, but I can\u2019t say I\u2019m surprised. Advisors can be as misleading as they are helpful, and this is a widespread problem that needs addressing.\n\t\tIn the College, students typically have between 15 and 20 credits outside of their primary major to meet the graduation requirement. These are used to fulfill general education requirements, pursue a second major or minor, or take elective courses that align with a student\u2019s interests.\nThe freedom to pursue one\u2019s intellectual pursuits is, of course, one of the draws of the College. I am looking to pursue two majors myself, in somewhat interconnected but disparate fields of study: the flexibility offered by the curriculum allows me to explore these interests without taking an obscene number of classes.\n\t\t\t\tSEE MORE FROM JESSEY SHIN:Making a case for the less popular college housesNavigating the maze of Penn's resources\ufeffThe problem is few students go into their first year knowing which major they would like to pursue, much less exactly which courses to take.\u00a0\nThe College puts a lot of effort into informing incoming students about the curriculum and what they have to offer, such as through the Compass module on Canvas that gives a foray into some aspects of the College experience (something that other schools do not offer). However, the sheer number of options can be overwhelming, giving rise to a unique need for personalized, one-on-one guidance. This is where pre-major advisors come in.\u00a0\n\tPre-major advisors, assigned to each student before they start their first semester at Penn, are a vital resource for College students. They guide students through the course selection process, encouraging and helping them as they explore their various interests and eventually settle on a major.\nI can say that I have had a relatively good experience with my pre-major advisor. However, I also found that some of the advice offered was not fully applicable to my circumstance, because of the recent transition from Penn InTouch to Path@Penn.\nOther students, however, are not as lucky. I have heard stories about advisors making their students cry, spreading misinformation, jeopardizing their advisees\u2019 course registration, you name it.\nIn an interview, one student (who requested anonymity) shared that they have had trouble reaching their pre-major advisor from the get-go. College students must meet with their advisor one-on-one to get their course registration hold lifted; without this, they are not eligible to participate in advance registration. The student was only able to reach their advisor a day or so before the deadline and has continued to have trouble with availability.\nOf course, their pre-major advisor experience was less than ideal. \u201cHer guidance wasn\u2019t so much guidance as it was looking at the boxes and seeing if I checked them,\u201d they said. \u201cI don\u2019t think I would feel comfortable going to her for personal issues, such as which major to pursue or how to explore [some of my interests], because I don\u2019t think she would point me [in] the right direction.\u201d Instead, they had been utilizing their PennCAP advisor (available for FGLI students) for these concerns.\nOn the other hand, some students are able to form a positive relationship with their advisor and find that they are helpful in navigating their interests. Rishi Dadlani, a College first year, described his advisor as \u201cfriendly and helpful. He gave me his phone number and told me to contact him if I [had] any questions \u2026 If I saw him around campus, I would say hi, and he always sends us a beginning-of-semester email.\u201d\n\t\tGet our newsletter, DP Daybreak, delivered to your inbox every weekday morning.This disparity in advising quality means that some students are at a great disadvantage compared to others. While some advisors are able to \u201cpoint students in the right direction,\u201d helping them take the right step forward in their college experience, others fall short. Their advisees must navigate the complicated process of learning about the majors, gen-ed requirements, and figuring out (the surprisingly difficult) advance registration process on their own.\nWhen done right, the freedom of the College curriculum can allow students to truly delve into their academic interests and eventually settle on the right path for them. However, that process requires a lot of research and planning that is supposed to be aided by a pre-major advisor. For incoming first years who are unfamiliar with the landscape at Penn and underclassmen students, this disparity in advising quality poses a challenge. Penn must ensure that all students are able to best utilize the resources at their disposal, and the first place to start is with the guidance they receive.\nJESSEY SHIN is a College first-year studying sociology and communications from Seongnam-si, South Korea.

          "article_content": "Guest Columnist Raheem Williams recommends three books for the Penn community to engage with this Black History Month.Dear Fellow Quakers,\nAs we celebrate Black History Month, it's crucial to recognize the multifaceted nature of the Black American experience. This month offers an opportunity to delve into the depths of history: exploring narratives that challenge, inspire, and provoke thought. In the spirit of true academic inquiry and in honor of this significant month, I wish to highlight a selection of works by Black authors whose perspectives might diverge from the more commonly embraced interpretations of Black history and culture.\n\t\tIn recommending these texts, my intention is not to endorse every opinion expressed by the authors, but to underscore the importance of engaging with a diversity of viewpoints. These authors challenge us to look beyond the prevailing orthodoxy and to question the narratives that have become commonplace within academic circles. They remind us that the Black American experience, like any aspect of human history, is richly diverse and complex.\nAs members of an academic community that prides itself on intellectual rigor and openness, it is our responsibility to explore a broad spectrum of perspectives, especially those that provoke debate and reflection. Let us take this Black History Month as an opportunity to broaden our horizons, engage with ideas that challenge us, and appreciate the rich tapestry of narratives that comprise Black history in America.\n\t\t\t\tRAHEEM WILLIAMS is an Executive MPA student at the Fels Institute of Government and a member of the Committee on Open Expression.

          "title": "Francesco Salamone | Is Penn about liberal arts or elite jobs?",
          "article_content": "\u201cWelcome to Penn! You are the most diverse class we ever admitted!\u201d The convocation rhetoric makes you feel so special. Penn is diverse because a student comes from Wisconsin and another from Kazakhstan. One plays the flute, one plays squash. Never mind that all of them want to be bankers or consultants. I wish someone had told me that nearly every other person sitting at Convocation with me would end up in the funnel. That however diverse my first-year class was, my senior class would simply not be.\nAs a teaching assistant for Wharton\u2019s required \u201cBusiness and You\u201d leadership course, I mentor first years adjusting to college and exploring careers. Someone confessed, \u201cIf not banking, then what else could I possibly do?\u201d If the best business school in the world (U.S. News debates aside) makes you believe you only have one option from day one, the institution, culture, and entire system have fundamentally failed.\n\t\tOf course, there is nothing wrong with those jobs: The last thing we need is a trembling economic system and inefficient markets. The problem is blindly assuming that one in two employed Penn grads and 80% of Wharton grads woke up and consciously made such a decision. Unpacking our culture proves how little of a decision this is and how everything revolves around two words: prestige and control.\nIt is common knowledge by now that Penn students are privileged. However, you may not know that for every single student from the bottom 20%, over 21 people come from the top 20%, blithely offsetting their upbringing. The result? An abject elite detached from reality. Okay, perhaps this is cynical, but if we are known for our elitist \u201cseeing and being seen\u201d culture, is it a surprise that 25% of us are so disillusioned to think the average U.S. salary is above six figures? Of course not (both not surprising and not true).\n\t\t\t\tPenn\u2019s alarming lack of socioeconomic diversity (despite efforts acknowledged this) unequivocally creates a culture perpetuating the value of money at the expense of everything else. The people you sit next to in class distract you with their laptop screens: purchasing a Gucci bag or booking Airbnbs in Cancun. The emails you receive are about banking and consulting events. This is the model. The only one. The only one, right?\nLet\u2019s be honest, \u201cjust follow your passion\u201d won\u2019t pay the bills, and I cannot blame an indebted or underprivileged student for desiring financial freedom with a high-paying job. This is why I am not saying the Wall Street lifestyle is unethical, although like others, I could. I am saying this is only one way to live your life. One of infinitely many. Which one makes sense for YOU?\n\tEveryone at Penn is good at planning, several are good at doing, and almost none are good at reflecting. The purpose of your college education is not exclusively career preparation. If this is what they had you do, I hate to tell you that you have been robbed. As writer William Deresiewicz argues, \u201cWhat you should want to develop in college is the habit of reflection, which means the capacity for change because most of what you come across in college will inevitably fade from memory. What is left over, precisely, is you.\u201d A culture, even more so an institution, should give you the tools to understand what model of life you want to live, not impose the model on you.\nYet, my student's question is central and inevitable: What else if not banking?\nAsking yourself what truly energizes you is no easy task, because it requires the vulnerability to let go of the comforting lifetime certainty that the predetermined path gives you: 2025 summer recruiting, analyst, associate \u2026 Well, the desire to eliminate uncertainty eliminates life. What do you plan to do after \u201csome years of experience\u201d with your future free time and why on earth are you not doing it now?\nIn his book \u201cExcellent Sheep,\u201d Deresiewicz advocates for the importance of time off, slowing down, breaking the cycle of endless achievement, and acknowledging the existence of a world outside of your Ivy League. It may be scandalous to some and unmistakable to others, but what if you replaced your obsessive passion for finance with one that is harmonious, perhaps exploring capacities you have not had a chance to cultivate? What if you did something you purposefully cannot put on a resume or post on LinkedIn? Yes, you may be \u201cbehind\u201d those who doubtlessly persist in the hierarchy, but what is the purpose of being at the top if you are climbing the wrong mountain?\n\t\tGet our newsletter, DP Daybreak, delivered to your inbox every weekday morning.The main idea behind the Pathless Path is not to neglect the ambition that got us where we are (not even to stop using Path@Penn), but rather to remember that Penn is not a four-year treadmill to (and playground for) the American elite. Yes, it was founded for them, but Penn\u2019s core mission today is the pursuit, enhancement, and dissemination of knowledge. We need to be aware of and manage our bewitching instinct to desire control and the social need for status. The truth is you cannot eradicate control and prestige. Just stop watering them. Like the French say, \u201cl\u00e2cher prise.\u201d\nLiberal education puts everything at risk and requires you to risk everything. The process is by no means comfortable, but it is liberating and extraordinary. If it happens right, it feels like giving birth to yourself. Or at least this is how I feel and the only obsession I have is ensuring everyone gets not the opportunity, but rather the choice of feeling this way, too.\nFRANCESCO SALAMONE is a Wharton sophomore from Palermo, Italy.

          "title": "Sose Hovannisian | A love letter to Philadelphia",
          "article_content": "Upon my acceptance to Penn a couple of years back, I was overwhelmed by an abundance of snooty comments and remarks relating to the city of Philadelphia, sentiments I could not visualize or understand. \u201cHave fun in Filthadelphia!\u201d or \u201cDon\u2019t get shot!\u201d often followed the congrats I received from most people. Not having had a proper vision of Philadelphia\u2019s layout or culture, I soon fell victim to my peers' alarming warnings and became rather cautious and overly attentive in my first weeks as a Quaker. Of course, the University alerts about various armed robberies or the occasional escaped prisoner did not help this berated city\u2019s case.\nWhile Philadelphia does have its safety hazards and concerning instances, I\u2019ve learned that just may be the price of living in a big city \u2014 the sixth biggest in the nation, in fact. Not to fluff up the real and present dangers, but it also should be said that Philadelphia is not much more dangerous than living in San Francisco, Chicago, or Miami, all of which are regarded as highly attractive places to live.\u00a0\n\t\tMany Penn students, coming from places of privilege and very comfortable livelihoods, are quick to harp on and nitpick at Philadelphia\u2019s imperfections. Jokes are constantly made about living in Philadelphia, comparing it to a punishment or drag. Most students are eager to move out, with their eyes set on New York City or Washington D.C., completely blind to the bevy of opportunities offered right here in Philadelphia. What many Penn students seem to overlook is the fact that Philadelphia is an esteemed, bustling, and charming city that many people dream of moving to and working in. Sure, Philadelphia is no tropical paradise, but it serves its purpose as a solid, spiffing city with so much to offer.\u00a0\nSo, instead of joining my peers in badgering on the City of Brotherly Love, I\u2019d like to take this time to highlight the best parts about living in Philadelphia, and hopefully convince you that we are extremely lucky to be going to school in such a vibrant and lively city.\u00a0\n\t\t\t\tSEE MORE FROM SOSE HOVANNISIAN:Penn students deserve more time off from their corporate-style academic calendarsThe pedagogic power of InstagramThe first thing that comes to mind when family or friends ask what I love about Philadelphia is, more often than not, the incredible food scene. Almost every restaurant, cafe, and quick lunch spot I have tried has wowed me, and I\u2019d like to say that that\u2019s a lot coming from a Los Angeles native! Just last year, Philadelphia won four titles in the James Beard Awards, whose prestige can be compared to \u201cthe Oscars, but for food.\u201d Beyond the bevy of choices we have near campus in University City, there are countless hidden gems and highly acclaimed restaurants in Rittenhouse, Fishtown, Northern Liberties, Manayunk, and more. Philadelphia is known for its diversity, and its countless cuisines are here to prove it. \u00a0\nPhiladelphia\u2019s finest cheesesteaks and soft pretzels are great, and they\u2019re best when eaten in the stands of one of the city\u2019s stadiums. Philadelphians beam with pride every time the Phillies, Eagles, Flyers, and 76ers play. Living in a city with this much athletic pride is not only great for our college experience, but it\u2019s also just a good time. Being able to go to these games, engage in the city\u2019s love for the teams, and enjoy city-wide celebrations is something we\u2019re very lucky to have at Penn, where school-wide athletic spirit is low.\u00a0\n\tEven if you\u2019re not one to appreciate sports, you can easily be one to appreciate Philadelphia\u2019s teams in a different way, perhaps by admiring one of the big Phillies murals on the Walnut Street walk to Center City. Philadelphia\u2019s streets are decorated with many murals and public art, coloring the city and demonstrating civic engagement through the expressions of many local artists. What\u2019s more, Philadelphia also offers many outlets to enjoy fine arts, whether it's through a day spent at the Philadelphia Museum of Art or a night at one of its many popular jazz clubs. Last year, Philadelphia was named the Public Art Capital of America, and the Best City in America for Street Art. And to top these accolades, Philadelphia is constantly celebrated for its memorialized history.\nNamed the Nation's First World Heritage City, Philadelphia is also known as the birthplace of the United States. In a city with a history so rich, every building, street, and alleyway has a story worth telling. Independence Hall, Benjamin Franklin, and the Liberty Bell all make this city the perfect historical backdrop for college students, offering countless opportunities to engage with the legacy of this country\u2019s founding fathers and their work. In particular, Philadelphia\u2019s long history of Black trials and tribulations is a key feature of the city\u2019s development. What\u2019s more, Philadelphia has grown into an unbelievably diverse city, boasting a great range of racial, socioeconomic, cultural, sexual, and religious representation. \u00a0\nWhile I have only touched upon some of the things that make Philadelphia so great, every Penn student has the opportunity to explore this big city and discover its many wonders for themselves. Penn\u2019s location, being right across the bridge from Center City, gives all able students the opportunity to just take a brisk walk out of the Penn Bubble and enter a realm of possibilities, opportunities, and new experiences. And for those of you who would rather not get on your feet, the city can just as easily be explored with the comprehensive and convenient SEPTA system.\u00a0\nI call on each and every one of you to take a moment the next time you\u2019re about to bash Philadelphia and consider the validity of what you\u2019re about to say, while also acknowledging our privilege of being here. Learn to love this city, for we know it loves you!\nSOSE HOVANNISIAN is a College sophomore majoring in communications and minoring in history and consumer psychology from Los Angeles, Calif.

          "title": "Kaynath Chowdhury | I am pro-ChatGPT",
          "article_content": "I support the use of ChatGPT.\nA statement that, said aloud, would garner me sidelong stares despite the website\u2019s appearance in many lecture halls.\n\t\tThe use of ChatGPT has raised much debate among students and become a topic of considerable contention. Similarly, many professors hold polarizing views, as the use of generative AI has been harshly rejected in some classrooms while others have tentative policies supporting its usage. The limitation of emerging technology in educational spaces should raise alarm bells, as we are rejecting tools that could be invaluable for facilitating learning. \u00a0\nTo be clear, I am against academic dishonesty, and I haven\u2019t used ChatGPT in a duplicitous manner. However, saying that ChatGPT is synonymous with academic misconduct is a remarkably weighty statement. I do assent that some individuals could use ChatGPT in an academically dishonest way, such as employing it to write papers in their stead. But, a similar result could be accomplished via other online tools, like Google. Just recently, we have become privy to accusations of plagiarism by former Harvard President Claudine Gay, revealing how this is not solely a ChatGPT issue. Thus, our viewpoint of the perpetrator should be reframed, delegating the fault to the person, not the tool.\n\t\t\n\t\nWith the release of GPT-4, many professors and students alike need to reconsider its benefits. Professors already recommend YouTube for content help, so why not ChatGPT?\nChatGPT can be a remarkable asset that provides an advantage to disadvantaged students. Since many Penn students come into university with a deep background in their chosen field of study, which they gained from their access to prep schools or private tutors, the bridge between these two groups is substantial. ChatGPT provides a way to somewhat balance the playing field.\n\tFor one, GPT-4\u2019s added feature of uploading PDFs makes it ridiculously simple to ask questions about lecture content, at any time of the day, while tailoring it to your level of understanding, a skill that many professors and teaching assistants lack. As several professors are utterly immersed in their fields and many TAs have an intuitive grasp of the subject, they are often incapable of making complex topics digestible. Unfortunately, there have been many instances where I gave up on asking questions to avoid receiving a convoluted response.\u00a0\nWith ChatGPT, feedback is immediate, allowing students to reflect on areas of improvement in their work, and providing them with mechanisms to improve over time. Why go through the hassle of setting up TA office hours to ask a simple question when ChatGPT can do it instantaneously?\u00a0\nStudents outside of Penn who do not have access to an educational institution with tutoring facilities also stand to attain so much from receiving academic help from ChatGPT. This is due to its similarity to using online services like Khan Academy, though ChatGPT is much more personalized.\nProfessors who reject the idea of incorporating ChatGPT into classrooms have not considered thinking critically of its beneficial uses. Instead, they are content with adhering to traditional practices, foregoing innovation for comfort. On the other hand, students who are against the usage of AI hold themselves to a higher standard for not relying on outside sources \u2014 similar to many Penn students' views of receiving academic help through services like Weingarten tutoring or office hours. For many, receiving outside help is equated to a lack of intelligence. As with the many Penn students of privileged backgrounds, they do not require additional help and thus look down on disadvantaged students who do require these services.\u00a0\n\t\tGet our newsletter, DP Daybreak, delivered to your inbox every weekday morning.In the end, humans are meant to be adaptable and always have been. Rejecting technological advancements accomplishes nothing; rather, it is actively harmful to many students who lose out on such a beneficial tool.\nWith that said, we should all sit to reflect on the valuable uses of ChatGPT.\nKAYNATH CHOWDHURY is a College sophomore studying political science and computer science from Detroit, Mich.

          "title": "Francesco Salamone | Let\u2019s talk about dying!",
          "article_content": "\u201cWhat do your parents do?\u201d someone seriously asked me during Wharton orientation. Fighting my brain's battle between an unforced desire to share and an aversion to the anticipated awkward look, I recognized that I would face a long, interminable moment of apnea trying to explain to the world that I do not have two parents because my dad died. Grief exists, and at Penn, it isolates.\nTo be clear, I do not intend to be a prophet speaking universal truths because loss looks different for everyone, but I hope you will find truth in my words nonetheless. Death is a sensitive topic, not the least because it intertwines with cultural, religious, spiritual, and socioeconomic aspects of our identity. Yet grief is undeniably omnipresent, and Penn is no exception, meaning I am not the first one to write (or talk) about it, nor will I be the last, unfortunately.\n\t\tAlmost 40% of college students have lost a family member or close friend within the last two years. Considering there are 18.58 million college students, that makes us more than 7 million grievers. I guess we are not a minority, are we?\u00a0\nWharton senior Pranavi Karnati lost her father last December after a battle with glioblastoma. She bravely watched him suffer for more than a year and a half, but \u201cdespite the pain he felt, he always managed to make us smile.\u201d She experienced a slower, anticipatory death and described her grief as \u201cisolating.\u201d\n\t\t\t\tSEE MORE FROM FRANCESCO SALAMONE: \ufeffIs Penn about liberal arts or elite jobs?There is no definitively designated place to grieve at Penn. Yes, Student Health and Counseling helps (if you are lucky), but 61% of college counselors in the United States report feeling \u201csomewhat, little, or not comfortable at all\u201d with supporting students primarily on grief. Unlike peer institutions like Princeton that offer grief-focused support groups, Penn lacks such infrastructure. The only comparable program that existed was Actively Move Forward, but it has been inactive since 2019.\nWhat about Philadelphia-based groups? As Karnati shared, before you even get a chance to talk about grief, you may face an identity crisis. \u201cThere are groups for children and groups for adults. What am I? Where are college students supposed to sign up?\u201d\n\tThe result explains why grief feels isolating. Naturally, some prefer to process on their own, but sooner or later, we crave feeling less like an alien and more like we are not the only ones experiencing excruciating pain. And support groups are one easy way to find others who relate.\nOf course, this is only half the problem. Remember, I believe Penn is a detached elite. Having two parents is a privilege: emotionally but interestingly also economically, and substantially so. I cannot blame you for having a privilege you did not choose, but I can and will invite you to reflect on it.\u00a0\nAfter Karnati posted her terrible news, she received several supportive messages: \u201cLmk if you need anything\u201d stood out. She mentioned, \u201cMy loss is making me realize who my true friends really are.\u201d\u00a0\nCan Penn students only support one another through hasty texts with cheap acronyms?\nWe know your \u201cI\u2019m here if you need me\u201d is well-intentioned, but understand that it creates a dilemma by putting the onus of starting the conversation on us, inadvertently burdening the griever even more. The individualistically expeditious culture of Penn is inevitably in direct contrast to the prolonged nonlinear path that grievers experience. At best, Penn students are awkwardly unequipped to support a grieving friend and at worst, fundamentally incapable of slowing down to care and empathize. You can do better.\nLike what? Be present with your friend\u2019s pain, listen with the heart, respect disordered confusion, and discover the gifts of sacred silence over filling words. That is what grief counselor Dr. Alan Wolfelt calls companioning. I wish my friends knew about companionship to ask me about my dad. Ask me what he was like, what he liked to do, what his quirks were. God, just ask me what his name was. When you ask, you are not reminding me that he died (trust me, I know), you are letting me know that you acknowledge that he lived.\nThe truth is I cannot blame them. Part of the matter is institutional and part of it is cultural: Many of us are used to the high school familiarity of knowing at least some family members of our friends. For better or for worse, in college, you are nothing more to others than what you present. And unlike your Canada Goose, you cannot wear your invisible grief when you walk down Locust. What you can wear is a Penn Face and pretend no one died, even with your closest friends, because it is profoundly easier and more tempting than the unfathomable truth.\nSo please, I beg you, next time you come across a griever, think twice before ending the conversation out of discomfort or sending the \u201cI\u2019m here if you need me\u201d text. Think beyond and think deeper. Perhaps take the simplest approach: Sit down with them and see where they will bring you.\n\t\tGet our newsletter, DP Daybreak, delivered to your inbox every weekday morning.If we collectively accept death as a mainstream topic of social dialogue, grief will be easier to handle than to hide. Harvard professor and happiness expert Arthur Brooks says: \u201cGrief does not have to be a private misery and net harm to our lives. We can learn to comprehend it, manage it, and grow from it. And in understanding our own grief, we can help others heal and thrive as well.\u201d\nAfter seven years, I understand my grief, and it is my hope (and Karnati\u2019s recent hope) that these words will help somebody.\nFRANCESCO SALAMONE is a Wharton sophomore from Palermo, Italy.

          "title": "Zara Tena | You should take an ethics class at Penn",
          "article_content": "This semester, I somehow ended up with four out of my five classes being either directly or indirectly about ethics. As a political science major, I was really excited to take these classes, since whenever people talk about ethics nowadays, it mostly has to do with politics or international relations.\nAt a time when our reality changes so rapidly because of technology, and when we are faced with a number of global challenges, some people have forgotten about the importance of acting morally. Especially at a place like Penn, where everyone seems to be extremely worried about their future and their careers, people often disregard these values when they are caught up by the competitive environment. Because of this, one would think that ethics classes would be extremely beneficial for all, but do they actually contribute to making students more ethical individuals?\n\t\tAccording to my professors, they don\u2019t.\nIn all four ethics classes, my professors started the semester by telling us that ethics classes will not make most of us more ethical. I sat there, listening to all of them, and I just could not understand why they would say something like that. If I wasn\u2019t going to learn anything, what was the point of taking these classes?\n\t\t\t\tSEE MORE FROM ZARA TENA:The urgent need for younger voices in politics\ufeffIt\u2019s okay to be ordinaryThat\u2019s where I was wrong: I have been learning a lot. While perhaps the main goal of ethics classes is not to turn students into more ethical people, they definitely give us the tools we need to critically engage with ethical dilemmas. By taking these classes, I might not become a better person, but they have given me a space where I can explore, discuss, and reflect about where I stand on so many issues and what my beliefs about morality actually are.\nEthics is not a subject that can be forcefully taught through lectures and readings. There is no way that we can sit down for three hours every week and magically become more ethical just because we memorize theories and read long papers written by old white men. The goal of these classes is not to tell us what is \u2018right\u2019 or \u2018wrong,\u2019 \u00a0but to give us the skills to navigate the gray areas in ethical decision making.\n\tThese classes encourage self reflection and personal growth. Even when analyzing big case studies or exploring different theories, students are pushed to question their own values, beliefs, and biases. While this may not guarantee that we will completely transform our moral compasses, the self awareness that comes from these reflections creates a great foundation for understanding why we act the way we do and also invites us to try to understand others.\nThe fact that ethics classes begin with a warning \u2014 that you won\u2019t become more ethical by taking them \u2014 should not stop anyone from giving them a chance. The ability to think critically, understand different values and perspectives, and have the skills to self reflect are essential parts of any college education. They prepare students for the complicated moral dilemmas they might face in their personal and professional lives \u2014 especially when most people at Penn will end up with jobs that are notorious for their ethical scandals!\nZARA TENA is a College sophomore studying political science from Puebla, Mexico.

          "title": "Lala Mustafa | Breaking our social routine",
          "article_content": "How many times have you found yourself in a never-ending cycle of back-and-forth messages, trying to pin down a date for a long overdue catch up with a friend? Every get together begins to feel as if it requires intricate planning and strips away the simplicity of social connection. This routine becomes stifling, lacking spontaneity and authenticity; you\u2019re constrained to coordinating with the same faces in the same places.\u00a0\nThis is what I like to call scheduling fatigue.\u00a0\n\t\tAs a result of this phenomenon, gatherings among friends are beginning to resemble scheduled business meetings, meticulously arranged via tools like When2Meet or synchronized Google Calendars.\nWhile resorting to scheduling may seem like the only viable option to maintain a semblance of social connection, perhaps it's time to embrace the idea of venturing out solo: I\u2019m challenging you to go on an unplanned side quest all by yourself to a third place.\u00a0\n\t\t\t\tMORE FROM LALA MUSTAFA:A nation on defense: Dismantling misinformation against Azerbaijan in the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict\ufeff\ufeffAllow me to explain. Picture the first place as your home and the second as your place of education or work. Now, the third place emerges as a public sphere where individuals congregate, not out of any obligation like in the previously mentioned locations, but, for lack of a more precise term, to simply vibe. It could be the cozy corner of a cafe, a communal park, or even the neighborhood barbershop \u2014 anywhere that\u2019ll allow you to interact with people outside your usual circles.\u00a0\nYet, at many universities like Penn, the concept of a third place seems all but lost as our lives remain restricted to school grounds, causing even our first and second places to converge into one. While spots on campus \u2014 like Stommons, Pret, or the cultural centers in ARCH \u2014 can offer some respite, they often come with the latent pressure of being on the clock. Conversations here revolve around assignments, internships, and the intricacies of Penn culture. The chances of an unexpected encounter dwindle given that most people in attendance will be other Penn students. As we\u2019re cocooned in the Penn bubble, it comes as no surprise that many students spend their four years in Philadelphia without ever fully exploring it.\u00a0\n\tYet, this insulation comes at a cost that extends far beyond what we realize.\u00a0\nIt severs our connection not only from the outside world but also from ourselves. That is, within such limits, our individuality dwindles, reducing us to mere roles influenced by our peers. By excluding ourselves from a wider social sphere, we inhibit opportunities to engage with diverse perspectives, trap ourselves in a cycle of familiarity, and risk leading monotonous lives that pave the way to burnout.\nHowever, in our lives, both intimacy and affiliation with broader communities are essential. While intimacy often stems from our immediate circles, affiliation thrives in third places where spontaneous interactions occur. These spaces facilitate easy contact with new individuals on a regular basis, without the need for prior scheduling.

          "title": "Beatriz B\u00e1ez | No closed captioning available",
          "article_content": "Columnist Beatriz B\u00e1ez explains her experience with language fatigue at Penn.On my first day at Penn, I called my father in distress, telling him I needed to move back home and study there as I was going to die alone at this university. My father asked why, and I quickly responded, \u201cI haven\u2019t met anybody in three hours. I have no friends. It\u2019s over for me.\u201d\u00a0\nThat very same night, I went to a New Student Orientation event at Houston Hall. As I nervously paced the floor in my Crocs, I overheard some students speaking Spanish and immediately gravitated toward them. Confessing, \u201cI heard Spanish, and I feel saved,\u201d I ended up meeting three genuine individuals, all from various parts of Latin America. Having arrived in the United States, it felt comforting to hear voices that reminded me of home. This comfort is priceless in such a foreign environment.\n\t\tAll my life, I\u2019ve taken courses in Spanish, spoken Spanish at home, and been berated by my grandmother whenever I spoke too much English. Arriving at Penn, I didn\u2019t anticipate the struggle I would face taking classes taught in English, as I had been lucky enough to have been extensively taught English from a very young age.\nBut speaking in a second language most of the time, even as a fluent speaker, is incredibly draining. Meeting native Spanish speakers at Penn was truly a blessing. However, I have found that some people react adversely to me speaking my primary language. These are not continuous reactions of a high degree, but there have been enough small instances to mark me.\u00a0\n\t\t\t\tMORE ON THIS TOPIC:Students celebrate 40th annual Festival Latinx, honoring Latinx culture on campusLa Casa Latina celebrates 2023 Latinx Heritage Month at PennOn various occasions, I have had Latinx friends say, \u201cLet\u2019s speak English so X person doesn\u2019t feel excluded,\u201d or even resort to English for \u201cconvenience\u201d when we\u2019re alone. For the former, I understand the sentiment. I wouldn\u2019t want someone to be excluded from a conversation in such a way. However, when I\u2019m naturally speaking Spanish, having my speech interpreted as a personal offense is off-putting.\u00a0\nIn one instance, I met a student through a mutual friend on a night out. This friend and I speak fluent Spanish; the person I had just met did not. Throughout the night, I had various conversations with my new acquaintance \u2014 who I found quite amicable \u2014 and my friend. I would naturally speak Spanish with the latter, not thinking much of it. The next morning, my friend told me how the new acquaintance felt I hated them for speaking Spanish in front of them, knowing they didn\u2019t speak the language.\u00a0\n\tI was shocked by the assumption and, in all honesty, a little offended. I found it quite conceited that one would think another person is speaking in their first language to actively exclude them. Speaking in a first language, for me, is purely a relief issue. Although I am fluent in English, after an entire week of speaking it, it can be extremely draining; thus, particularly in a social setting, I don\u2019t want to add to the exhaustion.\u00a0\nIt is more than fine to be curious about what somebody is saying and ask for a translation. However, immediately expressing discomfort upon hearing another language and presuming the other person is talking badly about you is inconsiderate toward them. More often than not, this language switch is for comfort. This was the first of sufficient instances that exposed a pattern in my time at Penn. In another class, I grew close to a few other Spanish-speaking students. One of them continuously suggested we switch back to English for seemingly no valid reason and would reply to any comment of mine in English.\u00a0\nThis harsh reality on campus expands into the club scene. In one instance, a native English speaker attended a club meeting primarily led in Spanish. Within this meeting, if club members asked questions in Spanish, any other members who answered quickly switched to English. Evidently, the intent is to have everybody be able to partake in conversation. However, members within a Spanish-led group should be able to detach from English formalities within club meetings, particularly if the club seeks to embrace Latinx heritage.\u00a0\nSpeaking in my primary language is the greatest manifestation of my culture, particularly since Spanish accents are so diverse throughout Latin America. Having to switch to English not only in academic settings but in seemingly every other sphere of Penn life further disconnects me from the culture I\u2019ve been surrounded by my entire life until now. This applies to any person whose main language isn\u2019t English, not only to Spanish speakers.\u00a0\n\t\tGet our newsletter, DP Daybreak, delivered to your inbox every weekday morning.Penn has students from over 100 countries, with around 19% of the student body being international. If one truly wants to immerse themselves in Penn\u2019s multilingual community, one needs to recognize that a language barrier works both ways. Just as an English speaker may be tired from learning another language, a non-English speaker can be drained from constantly speaking English. It\u2019s crucial to recognize that for the latter, multilingualism surpasses a simple language requirement and spills over to nearly every sector of their life at Penn.\u00a0\nLanguage fatigue is a true reality, especially for individuals who haven\u2019t learned English from a young age. Thus, if somebody within your social group is speaking their first language, which you are not fluent in, it does not give you the right to feel offended or urge them to speak in a tongue you understand. And, if you are a non-native English speaker, as much as you can, \"habla en tu primer idioma y que los dem\u00e1s se ubiquen.\"\nBEATRIZ B\u00c1EZ is a College first year studying mathematics and political science from San Juan, Puerto Rico.

And, if white is a moral choice, there is an enormous challenge: then you're challenging an entire civilization,\u201d said James Baldwin.\nWhiteness is the myth we\u2019ve been sold and under which we live. In our instruction at the University of Pennsylvania, we were told to reach for safety and to secure our decadence. So are the students now, but they are not nearly as certain that this is the road they\u2019d really like to walk. The students I knew have already paid that price for that ticket, and their horizons, on a human level, look bleak.\u00a0\n\t\tPhiladelphia is not a college town. It is a real city, a Black city, a poor city whose reality reflects the depth of the American crisis and yet contains the possibilities of its salvation. From the soil of this city rose heroes like Teddy Pendergrass, The Delfonics, McCoy Tyner, and Alfie Pollitt. A friend, then a nursing student who had packed her bags for New York City after graduation and returned a few years later to work in the hospitals, remarked on her return, \"Philadelphia has soul.\"\u00a0\nIn the five years since I\u2019ve graduated, the tone of campus has shifted. Students are developing a new language in order to deal with existential questions: What is the purpose of education and the responsibility of students in the wake of war? More than in my time, it is now clear that we, the students, want to be free. The crisis is deepening, and history is accelerating.\n\t\t\n\t\nFewer illusions are possible for the young mind in Philadelphia, which tempers and sharpens it like metal on metal. What the path to whiteness and an invented safety then produces is a delusional and unfree state. My peers, who are banking, coding, and consulting their lives away, are living as prisoners to the choices they\u2019ve made.\u00a0\nAll the beauty, genius, and potential I witnessed when we were young together, freshman year before the vicious teeth of Penn successfully \u201csocialized\u201d most of us, has been wasted, whittled down into dust, and lost. My old friends might have money, but they didn\u2019t manage to save their souls, and some part of them knows this fact \u2014 that they are perishing. We were never meant to become the fools and tools of the mythic America: the one that is superior, war-hungry, greedy, and hypocritical. These choices did their damage. That was an aberration. Now, we are entering a time of correction.\u00a0\n\tWe want to know the meaning of our lives when we live in a country whose hand assassinates a man and poet as beautiful and courageous as Refaat Alareer, when we live in a society in which Aaron Bushnell had to die so that humanity could live. When the youngest students of Philadelphia stand to say they are no different from the children of Palestine, that the bombs dropped abroad also explode in our neighborhoods, we then know it is true for ourselves \u2014 that we bleed the same as these children in Palestine, as all the men and women we encounter in Philadelphia.\u00a0\nOur bondage to the genocide in Gaza is through the struggle to become moral human beings in America, and to relinquish our country from the myths that strangle us and our people.\u00a0\nIt is unmistakable that the education Penn offers is bankrupt, and that some cancer, invisible but detectable, poisons our relationships to each other and to ourselves. The scramble for acceptance into mediocre clubs and fraternities is insufferable, and the false authority these groups stand on in order to make these judgments is embarrassing.

          "title": "Hanadi Abdulkadir | How poor dining hall food shapes our mental and academic capabilities",
          "article_content": "At this point, many Penn students have lived the terrible dining stories at a number of halls across campus. While it\u2019s important to discuss the health and sanitary risks associated with some of these concerns, it\u2019s also necessary to break down how this problem factors into students\u2019 academic and mental well-being.\u00a0\nOpening Sidechat every few days to see yet another picture of undercooked meat or hearing horror stories from my friends dissuades me from trekking across campus to eat at many of our dining halls. Oftentimes, I find myself skipping meals or stretching the time out between each one \u2014 until I accept the fact that I\u2019ll be eating the same food I already ate a couple times that week. Does this mean that I\u2019m probably missing out on some of the necessary vitamins or fiber I should be getting daily? Probably.\n\t\tNumerous Penn Dining Wellness emails live in our inboxes with tips on improving digestive health and practicing better healthy habits in our daily lives. Additionally, the official page for Penn Dining boasts awards and recognitions for sustainability and top college dining. However, the pristine and glossy promotional pictures of sandwiches, smoothies, and breakfast bowls tell a completely different story from the reality on campus.\nWith two of the most historical repeat offenders \u2014 Hill House and 1920 Commons \u2014 being the only consistent options available for on campus dining during the weekend, it\u2019s much more convenient to resort to the other retail spots scattered around campus. However, some of these locations are far apart, depending on where you live, and can add additional costs to weekly expenses. \u00a0\n\t\t\t\tSEE MORE FROM HANADI ABDULKADIR:\ufeffPenn should require an African American history courseWhy social media and Palestinian activism goes hand in handAdditionally, for students who are dishing out a hefty sum of money to enroll in the dining plan, going out of their way to seek expensive alternatives takes away money that could\u2019ve been better spent elsewhere. Considering that first years and sophomores are required to pick a dining plan for their first two years at Penn, it\u2019s no wonder that students have consistently called for the food standards to match the high prices of these meal swipes. Ideally, no student should feel like they need to resort to options outside of Penn; rather, outside options should be supplemental to an already quality level of options at all dining halls.\u00a0\nSince coming to Penn, my relationship with food has become much more complex. I need to look twice when picking out a seemingly clean utensil to eat whatever is on my plate or stare extra hard at my salad with suspicion before consuming it. But growing up, food was always a way for me to connect with my family and friends, to bring us back together even when we hadn\u2019t seen each other in a long time. Yet the food at Penn, at its worst, has left me frustrated and succeeded at suppressing my appetite \u2014 something I actually can relate to other students about.\n\tAlthough certain foods are scientifically linked to improving mental clarity and focus, I hesitate in reaching for those vegetables because they don\u2019t look as fresh or appetizing when lined up on display in Kings Court English House. As a result, I look for short-term solutions in coffee, which leaves me feeling tired earlier in the day or exhausted while trying to tackle my assignments at night. In order to meet my immediate deadlines, I prioritize some assignments over others, meaning some classes suffer in academic performance and perpetuate an almost never-ending cycle of playing catch-up. I believe that the root cause of all these problems can be traced back to the lack of decent dining.\u00a0\nThis same sentiment has been echoed by many of my friends and peers. But the dining quality at Penn can be mitigated if the University addresses the root problem. Whether that be promoting clean and sanitary workspaces when handling food or streamlining student complaints to Penn Dining other than through email, the University can restore student faith in the system. When it comes to campus dining, Penn can improve upon our experiences by implementing the changes that students deserve to enjoy, especially at the height of midterm season.\nHANADI ABDULKADIR is a College sophomore studying international relations from Philadelphia.

          "article_content": "During Penn\u2019s recent administrative upheaval, the University community found an unexpected silver lining: For the first time, Penn was making headlines alongside Harvard and MIT.\u00a0\nThe presidents of these three institutions were at the center of an infamous congressional hearing in December after their alleged missteps on campus antisemitism. I\u2019ll admit, there is something far more distasteful about chaos at the Capitol than the collective HYPSM prestige.\n\t\tBut many of us are taking our education at Penn for granted, shedding our \u201cque ser\u00e1, ser\u00e1\u201d optimism, and wondering at times what it would be like to go to a more recognizable Ivy. For decades, we\u2019ve all but exhausted our morale by clarifying to passersby that no, Penn State and Penn are not the same university. And yes, Penn is actually active in areas outside of Wharton\u2019s finance programs.\nSo, when Penn Engineering announced its new undergraduate program in artificial intelligence, many of us were enthusiastic about the University\u2019s growing role in the innovation sector: a space thought to be dominated by less business-oriented institutions.\n\t\t\t\tSEE MORE FROM MRITIKA SENTHIL: Removing legacy admissions will align Penn\u2019s actions more closely with its educational missionWhy changing leadership won\u2019t eliminate antisemitism at PennBut Penn\u2019s realization, of possibly its most practical initiative, begs the question: Is the University actually necessary in DevOps? Does sitting in a classroom \u2014 let alone one that\u2019s in the midst of a campus known for its influx of finance bros \u2014 really supersede what can be MacGyvered by a tech junkie with only a laptop, caffeine, and time? I want to give a definite \u201cno.\u201d Otherwise, I would need to hold my classmates and myself accountable for upholding all the exclusivity that comes with attending Penn. And yet, there are a frustrating number of anonymous netizens, D-list journalists, and LinkedIn bards who call Ivy League universities like Penn \u201cout of touch\u201d \u2014 remnants of centuries-old American elitism in an era of bottom-up grassroots movements.\nOne C-suite executive anticipates that \u201cthe best AI engineers and builders won\u2019t graduate Penn Engineering. They'll be global, builders and in the right group chats.\u201d His readers agree, with one commenter further emphasizing that \u201cuniversities cannot keep up with the pace of free market innovation.\u201d When these schools attempt to go against the grain and align with consumer needs, \u201cit genuinely looks embarrassing and out of date.\u201d\n\tIn an environment where the use of AI models is largely democratized, we\u2019re naturally drawn to the trope of a layperson who forgoes bureaucratic systems to channel their intelligence: creating life-changing inventions that would have never come to be under self-serving corporate and political influences. And when ignoring cases of succor \u2014 as mainstream media unfortunately does \u2014 there are many examples of such successes. Bill Gates and Paul Allen, co-founders of Microsoft, were university dropouts. So were Meta Platforms co-founders Mark Zuckerberg and Dustin Moskovitz. As Penn\u2019s over reliance on donors came to light earlier this school year, critics of the upper crust have continued to group Penn with other perpetrators of social stratification. The field of AI is, by nature, continuously evolving. And limiting growth in the discipline to those who can afford, and then succeed in Penn\u2019s Department of Computer and Information Science courses is counterproductive.\nHowever, these narratives misrepresent the intentions of Penn\u2019s AI program.\nTo make a better case for Penn\u2019s AI major, I spoke with Robert Ghrist, Andrea Mitchell Professor and associate dean for undergraduate education at Penn Engineering. He describes how the process of integrating AI in education is similar to the effects of increasing access to music recording and playback technologies. Now, there is \u201cmore music for everyone at much lower prices,\u201d he told me. Nonetheless, \u201cartists at the very top of the industry\u201d are increasingly the benefactors of \u201ca concentration of rewards.\u201d Taylor Swift is, as any current news feed can attest to, perhaps the most prolific embodiment of such phenomena. And professor Ghrist strives to make Penn an incubator of sorts for the \u201cTaylor Swifts of AI\u201d that seek avenues for academic growth, to actually be the \u201cleading edge where the best thrive.\u201d\nAnd to thrive in this discipline, aspiring AI mavens are off course by simply memorizing browser instructions in JavaScript and praying for a tech equivalent of the coveted Goldman Sachs internship. After all, studying AI is a philosophical pursuit: an inquiry into the nature of consciousness and ethics of creating sentient machines. It\u2019s also a political pursuit, for AI poses challenges in regulatory compliance. There are countless possible liabilities for even the most basic ChatGPT input, such as unprotected user data and violations of intellectual property rights. \u00a0\n\t\tGet our newsletter, DP Daybreak, delivered to your inbox every weekday morning.Needless to say, as you might have noticed in my earlier columns, I am not an AI major. I\u2019m not even enrolled in Penn Engineering. Am I, of all students, in the right to quash critics of the Penn AI major when I dropped AP Computer Science in high school (with no regrets)?\nYet, it\u2019s clearly irresponsible to follow the well-intentioned advice from tech capitalists when constant innovation is not particularly ideal for society. Maybe I\u2019m just afraid of a \"Black Mirror\"-esque dystopia, but there is a kind of ominous quality to the idea of highly skilled AI scientists off the reins. Penn, however, is cultivating an ecosystem that nurtures AI talent, albeit not by stifling the next Elon Musk or Sam Altman with red-tape-ridden academics; instead, Penn fosters ethically conscious innovation that addresses complex societal challenges. And so, the fact that I can engage with the Penn curricula across departments has a surprising beauty. The opportunity to become a part of this technological movement \u2014 or, dare I say, revolution \u2014 is the gift of studying AI at Penn.\nMRITIKA SENTHIL is a first year studying management and Russian and east European studies from Columbia, S.C.

          "article_content": "Artificial intelligence is a topic we can\u2019t seem to get enough of. From frequent announcements regarding policies within classrooms to endless professors and visiting scholars weighing in on the unprecedented effect large language models will have on our lives, I\u2019m sure we\u2019ve all discussed to death how revolutionary ChatGPT has become for college students.\u00a0\nMany of us have even had the chance to firmly establish positions on whether the University should embrace the technology wholeheartedly or put in place safeguards to prevent it from eroding the value of a college education, but up until now, the vast majority of conversations have been on a non-technical level.\n\t\tThat all potentially changed in this past month when Penn announced their first Bachelor of Science in Engineering in AI. Thankfully for us, Penn has chosen to launch this interdisciplinary degree at the \u201coptimal time\u201d to \u201ccreate a society where AI isn\u2019t just a tool, but a fundamental force for good to advance society.\u201d But at what cost? To what extent should we be using college as an opportunity to hyperfocus on not just a certain field (computer science), but a field within a field? Majoring in AI panders to the pre-professionalism Penn is known for and removes many of the foundational elements of the field that underlie innovation.\u00a0\nIn an interesting recent LinkedIn post, David Magerman pondered the implications of a university building complete undergraduate curriculums around a \u201cmodern business tool that is a niche application of computer science, diverting students away from a broad education in computer science.\u201d He went on to ask pointedly, \u201cWhat's next? A Bachelor of Arts in Blogging from the Annenberg School? A Wharton BS in Quantitative Trading?\u201d\n\t\t\t\tSEE MORE FROM AKIVA BERKOWITZ:The newsletter is dead\ufeffIsrael under attack: What do you stand for?As a current computer science major, I\u2019ll admit the AI curriculum looks fascinating. There is such an array of eye-catching electives (from Deep Generative Models to Natural Language Processing) that, if I were doing my degree all over again, I suspect I would have been swayed to switch into the major. But as a recently graduated computer and information science friend put it, the degree \u201cseems like the cool parts of CIS\u201d without the heavier basics like operating systems, computer systems, and physics \u2014 building blocks on the entire computer domain. \u00a0\nThe question I ask myself is whether artificial intelligence is really enough of an independent field that it transcends computer science and necessitates its own major. Is the relatively new field of AI established enough, broad enough, and unique enough such that the skills we gain through taking just those mostly career-focused courses today will undoubtedly remain relevant in 30 years and justify the $84,600 a year sticker price? I simply wonder how likely it may be that AI will become so unrecognizable in 20 or even 10 years, given its breakneck pace of innovation, that students may have wished that their majors in college focused on more fundamental elements of the field that innovators keep turning back to for insight.\u00a0\n\tAside from long-term career effectiveness an AI degree would have compared to computer science or electrical engineering, Penn is known for its pre-professional student body, and this new major shows signs of that sentiment leaking into the curriculum as well. In contrast to the Penn Integrates Knowledge professorships that bring in academic leaders who deeply understand multiple fields to better spark insight between them, this new major filters various courses of study to pluck out the elements we find valuable today.\u00a0\nIn this line of thinking, maybe we should consider the true value of a groundbreaking Wharton degree in quant trading that would promise to \u201csculpt the financial moguls of tomorrow\u201d with unparalleled prowess in algorithmic trading strategies and quantitative analysis.\u00a0\nAll this is to say, I immediately understand the value the current AI concentration within the larger CIS curriculum has. And I appreciate the Ph.D. programs that take students to a higher level of understanding, once they\u2019ve taken the time in their undergraduate training to build the broad foundations. I simply remain curious of the true value an AI undergraduate degree offers us as students over other forms of study within the field and the certain level of indulgence in pre-professionalism that it plays into on Penn\u2019s campus.

          "title": "Eric Najera | Penn must take action to enhance the dining experience",
          "article_content": "As busy college students, most of us do not have time to cook our own meals, and if you are anything like me, cooking is far from your forte. The hassle of having to go to the grocery store, cook, and clean can be time consuming and even more difficult when you\u2019re overwhelmed with classes, clubs, and homework. For the many students without access to a kitchen in their dorm, this presents an even bigger challenge. Luckily, college campuses have dining halls! Students simply swipe their card to get access to an all-you-care-to-eat dining experience. Dining halls provide easy access meals to students\u2014but what happens when that food is inedible?\nAs a picky eater, I know that simply because I do not like a dish does not mean it is unsafe to eat, but food with cockroaches and glass is unsafe for anyone. A seemingly obvious underlying assumption in dining is that food is safe to eat. College dining halls should be a place where students go to eat well-cooked, hairless, and insect-free food. However, that is not the case at Penn: There is a lack of responsibility to make sure the food is meeting basic standards for, let alone satisfying, all students.\u00a0\n\t\tMeal plans are far from cheap. For the sticker price, students would expect quality food, but they would be wrong. Both of the first-year student meal plan options cost $6,330, with the maximum amount of swipes being 296. Each meal swipe equates to roughly $17, which is about the same price as a Caniac Combo at Raising Cane's. As previously stated, Penn dining hall food is far from gourmet, and its price is too high for the quality delivered.\u00a0\nExpensive dining plan meals are not unique to Penn, but other Ivy League schools have similar prices for better quality food. Cornell University offers an unlimited meal plan, so students may visit the dining halls as much as they want with a fixed cost of $6,942 for food ranked second-best in the nation. So, for roughly 600 more dollars, Cornell students have access to unlimited meals and substantially better quality dining.\u00a0\n\t\t\t\tSEE MORE FROM ERIC NAJERA: \ufeffWe should be grateful to attend PennPenn clubs should have an assigned faculty member\ufeffAside from price and quality, weekend dining is another struggle. With the popular McClelland Sushi & Market and Houston Market being closed on Saturdays and the other dining halls closing at 8 p.m., food options are limited. Late-night study sessions means having to resort to local food places that remain open, and unlike nearby schools such as Drexel, our dining dollars do not work at off-campus restaurants and out-of-pocket money spent on takeout can add up quickly.\nBefore every school break, Sidechat is flooded with posts of excitement for home-cooked meals. In my classes, when asked what we are excited for, most students reply being able to eat good food. It is not uncommon for college students to miss their home-cooked meals, but when students are excited to actually eat food that is not served alongside insects, it signifies a problem.\n\tWith Penn\u2019s Bon App\u00e9tit contract still in place, we may not know how much Penn can do to change the dining experience. Safe, clean food should not be an unreasonable expectation.

          "title": "Zaid Alsubaiei | Does Penn\u2019s diversity represent its sense of community?",
          "article_content": "We all know the typical \u201ctypes\u201d of high schoolers, the different clich\u00e9s: Where are my nerds at? But, another attribute of student groups that has become increasingly relevant in the 21st century United States is the diverse ethnic makeup of its population. And, frankly, do we as a campus mirror all that comes with that national trend of diversity?\nThink of the friends with whom you often hang out. Then, ask those friends with whom they usually go out. Finally, think of the groups you are a part of, the extracurriculars in which you partake. Notice a pattern?\n\t\t\u201c[D]espite increased opportunity to live and work in mixed-race settings, Americans remain racially segregated in their friendship patterns,\u201d a study published by the National Institutes of Health found. \u201cSpatial racism, cultural encapsulation, and personal choice are contributing factors for patterns of same-race friendships.\u201d\u00a0\nThis pattern seems to reflect the divisions present in Penn\u2019s social scene as well. Despite coming from all sorts of backgrounds across the world, the University\u2019s students appear to have unconsciously adopted a policy of self segregation. In other words, we like to \u201cstick to our own\u201d by socializing with others to whom we relate to on a cultural, ethnic, or religious basis. So, regardless of Penn\u2019s efforts to integrate people of differing experiences and beliefs, there still remains a degree of resistance by individuals themselves to cross those racial or cultural lines.\n\t\t\n\t\nAs a result, the potential for diversity of thought is threatened. A narrow mindset develops within these groups that students pledge to, and they effectively act as echo chambers that exacerbate already crippling political polarization. We relate to each other less, rely on our \u201cown\u201d more, and become less tolerant of the views, and thus experiences, of those who do not necessarily look, think, or speak like us.\nThis kind of thinking \u2014 whether manifested in the form of race, religion, or otherwise \u2014 has led to serious tension at times and enabled a distorted view of certain communities and how they experience Penn. I attribute part of that thinking not to the identity groups we are a part of, but to how much we value them over who we are as individuals.\n\tHomogenous communities definitely have their place in the college experience: They help ease our transition when we first arrive at Penn, and their role cannot be replaced. I say this as an international student myself, who had a hard time acclimating to an entirely different culture and, most radically, diet. Nonetheless, we should treat these organizations as an aid to finding belonging on campus, not a substitute for individual thought and expression.\nHowever, none of this means individuals can\u2019t agree or always need to separate themselves from the group. The use of a large, collective voice can benefit our campus much more than we realize. What is important to note is that there lies a clear distinction between acknowledging the views of others and forcing ourselves to accept those views for the sake of conformity.\nThere is nothing wrong with disagreeing with the majority, whether it is one against two or one against a nation (though some may try to tell you otherwise). As long as you are respectful and driven by a desire to learn rather than defend, there are no limits on what perspective you may question. So, challenge your beliefs, reevaluate your viewpoint, challenge that of others (no matter who they are), and then reevaluate yourself again. It\u2019ll be hard at first, to express your precise, genuine thoughts without fear. But, remember that you\u2019re not alone (I struggle sometimes myself) and that it\u2019s a process you won\u2019t always get right.\n\t\tGet our newsletter, DP Daybreak, delivered to your inbox every weekday morning.The hardest part of breaking out of groupthink, after realizing it, is talking about it. My advice? Take the plunge and never look back. The next time you are in a group and the majority agrees with an idea you don\u2019t like, let it be known. Talk about it and explain why you think the way you do. Don\u2019t worry if some get offended or others simply do not agree; it is normal and, in fact, expected.\u00a0\nNever forget that disputes you engage in are an opportunity, not a challenge, and our differences are enlightening, not threatening. Only then will we begin to understand and appreciate each other more as unique actors in a truly historic community.\nZAID ALSUBAIEI is a College first year studying economics from Al-Khobar, Saudi Arabia.

          "title": "Eliza Carroll | You are what you read: Sidechat\u2019s impact on campus",
          "article_content": "I downloaded Sidechat this fall after my friends sent me too many screenshots of funny memes or jokes posted on the anonymous app. I figured that doing so would simply remove the middleman. I was already being exposed to the same jokes, memes, comments and judgements as those on the app anyway \u2026 right?\u00a0\nIn December, I returned home for reading days and fell into an easy pattern of studying. Nothing I did was wildly exciting or social, but I instead found myself enjoying the routine and satisfaction of productivity. During my study breaks, I would scroll on Sidechat \u2014 and from the comfort of my home, I felt myself spiraling into anxious dread about returning to Penn. Each time I opened the app, I was faced with a barrage of posts all echoing the same sentiment: Penn is awful and depressing. Without a second thought, I accepted those posts as fact, and in doing so, I allowed Sidechat to have more power than it deserves. In other words, I subscribed to the complaining culture that is pervasive on Sidechat.\u00a0\n\t\tUsing Sidechat, especially without intentional thought, is a way of looking at Penn through hypercritical glasses. Perhaps this is because negativity has been normalized and cynicism gets more upvotes. To some extent, this pessimistic messaging is diluted with the insertion of mildly entertaining memes or jokes, but the result is still the same. With each scroll, Sidechat is perpetuating a defeatist perspective of Penn.\u00a0\nSo, I arrived back at Penn to take my final exam: openly unhappy about returning to what I thought would be a bleak campus as a result of discourse on Sidechat. But to my surprise, it was not horrific, and I was able to enjoy my weekend of studying just as I had my week at home. The sheer volume of disheartening posts on Sidechat had clouded my perspective and ability to see the best in the situation. Sure, I was becoming one with a Huntsman GSR while others were at home enjoying break, but on the other hand, I was with my friends and able to have a sleepy campus all to myself.\n\t\t\t\tAs is the case with most other social media platforms, Sidechat is consumed passively and without a second thought \u2014 it\u2019s used to pass time, curb boredom, and satiate our addictions to our phones. And yet, students are absorbing and internalizing content more quickly than they can truly digest it.\u00a0\nGiven the bandwagon culture on Sidechat, users often build off of one another, creating a chaotic, and often dismal, echo chamber that does not truly represent life at Penn. Whether or not college is the best four years of your life, it is at least what you make of it, and Sidechat enables students to feel like victims of an unknown cause. For those who are actually struggling, Sidechat acts not as a productive outlet, but rather as a meta ether that provides no remedy other than the satisfaction that others are unhappy too.\u00a0\n\tSince winter break, I have in fact deleted Sidechat and am all the better for it. I still get sent the best and the brightest jokes by my friends, but I am no longer overwhelmed by unsolicited complaints on an hourly basis. Without Sidechat, my thoughts on the housing lottery, the floods in the Quad, and upcoming midterms are completely my own. Deleting Sidechat may not be for everyone, but it\u2019s imperative for those who chose to use Sidechat to take a more critical view of what is being circulated and evaluate whether or not they are benefiting from it. It may just change the way they see Penn.\u00a0\nELIZA CARROLL is a College first year studying international relations and art history from Greenwich, Conn.

          "title": "Cathy Li and Liala Sofi | History can\u2019t repeat itself; stand with Chinatown",
          "article_content": "Students for the Preservation of Chinatown protested outside the Board of Trustees meeting held at the Inn at Penn on Mar. 3, 2023. \nA few weeks ago, the streets of Chinatown came to life with firecrackers and lion dances ringing in the year of the dragon. As you walk through the brightly colored 40-foot paifang \u2014 known to most as Chinatown\u2019s Friendship Gate \u2014 you enter into a cultural oasis that has stood strong in the heart of Philadelphia for nearly 150 years. Beyond this fixture, Chinatown serves as a home to nearly 3,000 residents and numerous family-owned businesses, restaurants, shops, and community organizations. Whether you are going to Ken\u2019s Seafood Restaurant for a fun night out or Heng Fa for groceries, Chinatown feels like home.\u00a0\nUnfortunately, this community has been under constant attack for decades and is once again facing the threat of displacement and gentrification from a plan to develop an arena for the Philadelphia 76ers merely a block away. We firmly stand with the Students for the Preservation of Chinatown and urge you to do the same. \u00a0\n\t\tSince the early 1900s, Chinatown has been a victim of gentrification often driven by predatory infrastructure projects. In 1932, the construction of subway infrastructure at Ridge and Eighth streets \u2014 and the subsequent development of the Vine Street Expressway from 1957 to 1991 \u2014 resulted in the destruction of buildings and severe divisions within the community. Bringing in noise and pollution, the expressway eroded neighborhoods and people's quality of life. This was not Chinatown's sole battle, however, as it also faced multiple proposals of developments for a federal prison in 1992, a baseball stadium in 2000, and a casino in 2008.\u00a0\nThe story of Philadelphia's Chinatown mirrors other Chinatowns across the nation. Amid the 1994 fiscal crisis in Washington, D.C., then-Washington Wizards owner Abe Pollin negotiated a deal for the downtown Capital One Arena, where the city covered pre-development costs to acquire and demolish properties. Entrepreneurs in Washington's Chinatown voiced concerns about prices of real estate skyrocketing and parking impacts on businesses in the area. A decade later, most Chinese residents were forced to move out due to unaffordable housing. The parking shortage led to the closure of the last Chinese grocery store, accelerating the decline of the Chinese American population in the area to fewer than 400 residents today. Ironically, as D.C.\u2019s arena now relocates to the suburbs, the community is left behind, having endured irreversible destruction while in the midst of its recovery from the pandemic.\u00a0\n\t\t\t\tMORE FROM LIALA SOFI AND CATHY LI:Liala Sofi | The hypocrisy of billionaire philanthropistsCathy Li | Philadelphia\u2019s changing tastesIn New York\u2019s Chinatown, threats of displacement and economic insecurity also loom high. In 2021, the Museum of Chinese in America accepted a donation of $35 million in support of a borough-based jail complex which would displace Chinese American working-class people in the area. On top of that, its board executives were connected to the closing of the last unionized restaurant, beloved Jing Fong banquet hall, and construction of luxury towers that are actively raising rent and real estate taxes in the area.\nIn Philadelphia, the current 76Place project is being developed by 76 DevCo, an initiative by 76ers managing partners Josh Harris, David Blitzer, and David Adelman. Adelman is at the forefront of the construction of the arena and has promised not to displace the residents or businesses in Chinatown, but his past actions speak louder than his current words. Adelman works closely with Brett Altman, who also owns the University City Townhomes, and was a key figure behind the demolition and end of affordable housing in the West Philadelphia area that was previously known as the \"Black Bottom.\u201d This constant cycle of displacing residents and communities that have lived in the area for generations must end, and we must be the voice to make this happen.\n\tDevelopers of the project have stated that the arena will \u201cserve as a model for an equitable & inclusive community,\u201d yet there is not a single mention of Chinatown in the proposal. Efforts to ensure communities can benefit from this project read as empty promises when nearly 95% of residents, business owners, and visitors oppose the arena\u2019s construction.\nMany questions posed by residents have also gone unanswered by 76 DevCo. How will restaurants and small businesses in the surrounding area be protected? Who will clean the streets after huge events?\u00a0\nPreserving Philadelphia's architectural heritage demands careful consideration in urban development, but the development of the arena does the exact opposite \u2014 jeopardizing accessible low-income and senior housing complexes, healthcare clinics, and schools for children.\nPenn has direct ties to the developers in the area, and students should be cognizant of the situation. Adelman currently sits on Penn Medicine Board of Trustees and is the CEO of Campus Apartments, which houses many Penn students off-campus. But more importantly, Penn students are directly and indirectly involved in the Chinatown community, whether that be Penn Lions performing all throughout the city for Lunar New Year, or student groups like SPOC organizing initiatives to honor traditions celebrating the multi-ethnic communities that reside there.\u00a0\nDespite what greedy developers may suggest, Chinatown is not an ethnic theme park but a home. It\u2019s more than just a place to eat, it\u2019s a support network and a cultural hub for immigrants and visitors alike.\nIn the face of ongoing threats, Chinatown has demonstrated remarkable resilience and activism, advocating for the needs of all diverse communities of color that are integrated into the cultural fabric of our city. The next time you are in Chinatown, take a look around at all the place has to offer. Venture into Ebisu for some home decor and enjoy a Mochinut donut as you shop. Come by Dae Bak for soul-nourishing Korean barbecue. The opportunities to support your favorite restaurants and local businesses are endless.\nPlease don't turn a blind eye to what is happening outside the Penn bubble. Pay attention to what SPOC and other organizers are doing in the fight for the preservation of Chinatown. Educate yourself on what is going on in Chinatowns across the country. If you can, participate in programming like Crane Chinatown Community Center art exhibitions or Show Your Love for Chinatown events to learn more about the challenges facing the neighborhood. Sign petitions. \u00a0\nAdorned with dragon motifs, and gorgeous ornamental roof tiles, the Friendship Archway is not only an architectural masterpiece, but a labor of love \u2014\u00a0created for community by community. The engineers and artisans from Tianjin, China \u2014 Philadelphia\u2019s sister city \u2014 came together with residents and the city of Philadelphia to fund and invest in Chinatown, and you should too.\u00a0\nThe next time you walk through the gate, remember that the fight for Philadelphia\u2019s Chinatown, and Chinatowns everywhere, is not over.

          "title": "Caroline Magdolen | \u201cEveryone cheats.\u201d What can we do about it?",
          "article_content": "My guess is that nearly everyone reading this article knows someone who has been academically disingenuous, or been that someone before. Being academically dishonest isn\u2019t all about flashy examples, like the two admitted Penn students accused of plagiarism and fabricating data in 2022. There are smaller violations that may feel less egregious, or even harmless, like querying ChatGPT for help completing your homework, peeking at a friend\u2019s lab assignment, or answering a PollEverywhere as if you\u2019re in class, when really, you\u2019re snoozing in your dorm.\nAcademic dishonesty is having a moment in the spotlight. The advent of generative AI, the use of which cannot be reliably detected by grading softwares, will likely upend student learning for better or worse. At the same time, examples of plagiarism by prominent academics are being dug up left and right. The former president of Harvard, Claudine Gay, was ousted in part due to plagiarism concerns, and Business Insider found that former MIT professor Neri Oxman (the wife of billionaire Bill Ackman, who led the campaign against Gay) \u201cstole sentences and whole paragraphs from Wikipedia, other scholars and technical documents in her academic writing.\u201d\n\t\tTo be clear, I believe that academic dishonesty at Penn \u2014 going against community standards that your professor has explicitly outlined \u2014 is unacceptable, and that we should be doing more to penalize and prevent it.\nNevertheless, we must also acknowledge that academic dishonesty is understandable, in that we can piece together students\u2019 rationales when they do cheat, and even sympathize with them in some cases.\n\t\t\t\tSEE MORE FROM CAROLINE MAGDOLEN:\ufeffThe Rat Kings of PennThere\u2019s no better time for climate education\ufeffTo dissuade academic dishonesty, we employ sayings like, \u201cIt will only hurt you in the long run to cheat,\u201d or \u201cYou\u2019re taking advantage of other students who've completed their work fairly.\u201d This is true in some circumstances. If you\u2019re an aspiring quant and you\u2019re asking ChatGPT to calculate all of the derivatives on your MATH 1400 homework, it\u2019s going to show: First in your exams for the class, then in every math class you take thereafter, and especially in your future career. And if MATH 1400 is curved, your dishonest success capitalizes on the honest failures of others \u2014 not cool.\nBut this is not true in all cases. Jane* was a first year in her spring term when she was taking CIS 1210: Data Structures and Algorithms \u2014 a famously challenging CIS course \u2014 with Rajiv Gandhi, a famously challenging professor.\u00a0\n\tShe cheated on her coding assignment late into the semester, and as per the professor\u2019s policy, received a -300/100 on the submitted homework and zeros on all previously submitted homework, receiving a D as her final grade in the course.\nBut Jane believes that what is more important to her story is not what happened, but why it happened.\u00a0\n\u201cWhat drove me to make a bad decision? Why are [these classes] so infamous? It\u2019s because of notorious policies where you cannot collaborate on many assignments. You are given long problem sets to do, on your own, each week, with desperate students in office hour queues that are two to four hours long. Many times, you will go to the TA and not get a clear answer. It is a profoundly isolating situation, particularly for freshmen just entering college, and that\u2019s what drives well-meaning people to cheat.\u201d\nBased on my conversation with Jane, it seemed that she felt isolated at the time and was struggling to reach out for the support that she needed, both in CIS 1210 and at Penn as a whole. And given the limited support Jane could receive from TAs and her instructor, backtracking her friend\u2019s code felt more conducive to her learning than doing nothing.\nJane expressed a lot of remorse over what happened, and said that she still has a lot of respect for Rajiv, maintaining a good relationship with him to this day. She was also grateful that Rajiv was willing to handle this internally, since a low grade in the class looks better than a formal statement on her transcript, detailing her violation of academic integrity.\n\u201cI deserved to be punished harshly,\u201d Jane said. \u201cBut the collaboration policies of these introductory courses, and the punishment I received, wrecked my self-esteem and my early college experience. I felt that there was no way out.\u201d\nAccording to Jane, Rajiv's philosophy is to \"let go of your grades early: the sooner you stop caring about your GPA and start caring about learning, the better.\" She agrees with this philosophy, especially since he curves his courses generously, but sees this as out of touch with the realities of many Penn students.\nAfter students have prioritized perfecting their grades and resumes (and have been praised for it) in high school, those habits won\u2019t get undone overnight. Even at Penn, there are many institutions and accolades that continue to reward \u201cperfect\u201d performance over pursuing difficult academic disciplines, experimenting, and invariably messing up sometimes.\nFrankly, for a pre-med student in computer science (a track which Jane was considering at the time), the adage that \u201ccheating will hurt you in the long run\u201d skill-wise doesn\u2019t hold much water. The skillset of a future doctor and a software engineer just don\u2019t overlap enough. What can hurt a pre-med in the long run is a low GPA.\nAnd while there are some students for whom projects, internships, and technical interviews will get them a lot further in guaranteeing their success, this is not true for everyone. For many preprofessional students who may want to challenge themselves with a major or minor in CIS, they risk getting shut out of the study altogether.\nWhat frustrates me most about this entire situation is not that such harsh action was taken, but that it appears ineffective in tackling the issue at hand. If a student wanted to cheat, they could just take CIS 1600 or CIS 1210 during a different semester, when a different instructor was in charge and penalties were anecdotally known for being less harsh.\nWhile Jane\u2019s actions were clearly wrong, I can\u2019t help thinking that she was just the unlucky example that had to face the music, and she said as much in our interview: \u201cEveryone cheats in this class. You don\u2019t survive [CIS 1600 or CIS 1210] without talking to people, it just depends on whether you get caught. That doesn\u2019t make cheating okay, but it does mean that we need to rethink how these courses operate.\u201d\nSo, what can we do so that not everyone cheats?\nThis is a complex question, and there is no easy answer. It is crucial that as we frame the issue of academic integrity violations, we look at both the violations themselves and the root motivations that drive them \u2014 these actions are not taking place in a vacuum.\u00a0\nAcademic integrity violations these days are, to an extent, simply easier to commit. ChatGPT has led to a surge in \u201cunfair advantage\u201d violations. And even before generative AI, the pandemic had uprooted our usual test-taking environment. Now that classes are in person again, we no longer need to have take-home or open-Internet exams, but these still persist in some classes, and are easier to cheat on. Penn, given its history of fraudulent alumni, isn\u2019t going to be a place where professors can blindly trust students to refrain from cheating when presented with the option, so professors should take some responsibility for leveling the playing field in the classroom too.\u00a0\nJulie Nettleton, the executive director of Penn\u2019s Center for Community Standards and Accountability (CSA), relayed over email that CSA already works closely with schools and centralized resources at Penn to discuss how to proctor exams, and with faculty to discuss exams, syllabi language, and classroom policies.\nWhat constitutes a violation itself is currently not standard across classes, or even across different sections of the same class. How to handle a concern of academic integrity falls to the professor first \u2014 this is how Jane completed CIS 1210 with a lower grade, rather than a formal sanction from the CSA. It makes sense to delegate this responsibility to professors: It is more efficient than having the CSA handle every case, and professors should have the freedom to decide what constitutes cheating in their classrooms.\nHowever, this does open the door to students deliberately choosing sections of a course with professors that have more relaxed academic integrity policies. Conversely, some professors can be overly harsh, to the point where they are acting unfairly towards their students.\u00a0\nJill*, another student that I interviewed for this article, was falsely accused by her professor of collaborating on her final exam with her peers. At the start of winter break, the professor sent a class-wide email imploring those who worked together on the take-home exam to turn themselves in or have the matter escalated. Jill recalls that for students that turned themselves in, the professor lowered their grades accordingly \u2014 everyone else was reported to the CSA.\nIn the end, Jill\u2019s name was cleared, but she was assigned a case manager that seemed to have assumed she was guilty by default. As the case progressed, many of the details that the professor used to build the case against her appeared superfluous \u2014 for example, she and her friends had all rounded to the same decimal place in their work. Jill suspects that the escalation may have been personal: she had previously asked the professor, on behalf of the class, if he could make changes to his teaching style to facilitate learning.\nIt seems wrong to me that a professor could accuse a student and cause such extensive stress when in the end, Jill turned out to be innocent. It reminded me of some other methods that professors use to catch students cheating, such as Turnitin\u2019s flawed AI detector.\nPart of the solution to rampant academic dishonesty may also lie in expanding our vocabulary to discuss the issue, as John McWhorter pointed out in The New York Times. A class-wide cheating ring, direct plagiarism of original ideas from a paper as one\u2019s own, and copying a line of someone\u2019s code all constitute academic dishonesty, but range broadly in terms of severity and \u201cease of catching.\u201d However, this is rarely reflected in academic integrity policies.\u00a0\nIt can be awkward to suggest that some forms of dishonesty are worse than others, and more awkward still to draw the line between different punishments for different violations, but we must still have these conversations.\u00a0\nWhat should constitute dishonesty at all? When speaking with Jane, she would often circle back to how isolating it was to work alone on her assignments as a first year in introductory computer science courses, particularly as a woman in STEM. Every day, she would walk out of class \u201cfeeling way worse about [her]self.\u201d Now exploring chemistry, physics, and biology courses, she greatly appreciates the change in her academic environment, where students are encouraged to openly collaborate. The grade medians in chemistry are similar to those in CIS (which is to say, not great), but Jane is not as stressed as she was in CIS 1210, since she studies with her friends, and they can struggle and ask for help together.\u00a0\nWhile it was dishonest of Jane to copy code when it was against CIS 1210 policy, perhaps CIS majors and minors would learn more from the course if they were in a more collaborative environment to begin with. Jane has suggested that CIS 1210 should find a middle ground where students can learn from each other, but not be overly reliant on collaboration to perform well on exams.\u00a0\nShe also argues that there should be more opportunities for students to admit to academic dishonesty \u2014 through a friend at Stanford, she heard that at the end of a computer science class, students can select the assignments they have cheated on and receive a negative score on them, or risk facing more uncertain penalties if they are later caught.\u00a0\n\u201cThis policy gives people a second chance to do the right thing, and I do believe that you learn from an experience if you own up to it,\u201d Jane said.\nDeliberations over how best to address academic dishonesty can go on without end, but unfortunately this column must do just that. So here, I want to leave you with a reminder of what I said at the beginning: Academic dishonesty is unacceptable, but it is also understandable.\n\t\tGet our newsletter, DP Daybreak, delivered to your inbox every weekday morning.The hard, but necessary, solution to \u201ceveryone cheating\u201d is taking a good look at the stories behind academic dishonesty, and listening to the students involved with sympathy.

          "title": "Jack Lakis | What we can learn from Penn\u2019s college ranking",
          "article_content": "Last fall, a plethora of new results from U.S. News & World Report, Wall Street Journal, and Forbes elevated Penn in their national college rankings. Nearly every list places Penn among the top 10, some going as far as placing the University among the top five. This universal growth resulted from a key change in most of these sources\u2019 metrics: greater consideration given to postgraduate salaries.\nPenn famously has one of the highest-earning alumni bodies in the country. Starting salaries for Penn graduates are often considered the highest in the Ivy League. By mid-career, the average Penn alum is raking in $165,000 annually, while the national average for a college graduate caps out at $74,000.\n\t\tPenn draws a great deal of prestige from its potential to produce high earners, which is a direct result of our school\u2019s preprofessional culture. Nearly 50% of all Penn graduates enter one of two career fields: consulting or finance. This pipeline allows most Penn alumni to matriculate into high-paying jobs shortly after graduation.\nI\u2019m usually a defender of preprofessionalism. It\u2019s crucial that Penn graduates are able to find good jobs, and high salary potential is an immense advantage. But those jobs aren\u2019t everything. Many universities are making gains in rankings and name recognition based on alumni outcomes in public service careers.\n\t\t\t\t\ufeffSEE MORE FROM JACK LAKIS:\ufeffDo we all hate Penn?Staying focused after Magill's resignation\ufeffFor example, Harvard University boasts about its eight presidential alumni. However, when 1968 Wharton graduate Donald Trump was elected president, Penn mostly ignored his history with the school. Given his proximity to controversy and his unconventional political history, Penn\u2019s bump in prestige was limited by Trump\u2019s election. Our second closest claim to the White House is the University\u2019s relationship with President Joe Biden and the opening of the Penn Biden Center. I argue that this is as far as Penn\u2019s ties to the presidency will go. Nowadays, Penn\u2019s laser focus on professional development might repel students who will one day have presidential potential.\nComparable institutions to Penn have high-earning graduates and prestigious placements throughout the government, nonprofit sector, and the advocacy space. For example, Georgetown University feeds graduates into congressional offices and many Fulbright programs. Princeton University also regularly features its flashy roster of graduates in powerful political offices. These universities maintain a strong presence in the private sector but are also actively represented in government positions.\n\tIn these examples, the institution itself sponsors an undergraduate school dedicated to public service. At Georgetown, it\u2019s the School of Foreign Service, while at Princeton the role is filled by the School of Public and International Affairs.\nI propose that Penn follow suit and create a fifth undergraduate school dedicated to public affairs. This new school could absorb Penn\u2019s wildly popular social science programs, like PPE (Philosophy, Politics and Economics), Political Science, and Economics. Currently, most students in these majors are scooped up by consulting firms and investment banks. If these students were given an intentional focus on service and social responsibility, perhaps they could feel empowered to use their degrees in a more meaningful way.\nThe least Penn can do is expand its current effort to bridge the gap between social science degree seekers and careers in government and nonprofits. It\u2019s crucial that our student body actively engages with the robust policy infrastructure that Penn has already made available: Civic House, Perry World House, opportunities like Penn in Washington, and extracurricular engagements offered by the Government and Politics Association. From what I\u2019ve seen, these resources are underutilized at Penn. By snubbing them, Penn students are working against the general interests of the University to gain prestige.\n\t\tGet our newsletter, DP Daybreak, delivered to your inbox every weekday morning.Besides, it's about more than just rankings. We have the potential to empower our students to become leaders in society. TIME Magazine ranks Penn as the third-best college for aspiring leaders. However, the article states its rationale for this placement as a concentration of graduates in business careers. Other chart-topping schools on this list were noted for their programs in law, medicine, and more.\nUltimately, private sector homogeneity marks one of Penn\u2019s key weaknesses. As we move forward, Penn has a duty to educate leaders in more than one field. If Penn strengthened its programs in civic engagement, more graduates would be inclined to pursue roles in government and could elevate Penn\u2019s cultural stature. We should be known for more than salaries. We can do more than business.\nJACK LAKIS is a College first year studying political science from Kennesaw, Ga.

          "title": "Mia Vesely | Black Penn is vibrant this month and every month",
          "article_content": "As of late, most of my columns have focused on things I take issue with: Whether it\u2019s Liz Magill\u2019s resignation and the threats to free speech on campus, or the lack of racial diversity in Panhellenic sororities. I haven't highlighted the things that I truly appreciate and, more specifically, the places in which I\u2019ve found community at Penn.\nLast February, I argued that Black history is important for everyone. Education surrounding Black people, their lives, and their contributions should be integrated into the standard curriculum. Black Penn shows up and shows out every month, but this month in particular, there are many events and ways that Penn student organizations uplift the community and come together.\u00a0\n\t\tIt would be impossible to touch on all of these amazing events and their impacts, but I\u2019d like to paint a picture of some of these groups and their initiatives during this month and beyond. Planning for these events takes months. For example, when Descendants of Afro-Americans at Penn (DAAP) \u2014 a club founded just last year \u2014 put on their first-ever gala on Feb. 1 to kick off the month, you better believe that the event was well-planned and executed.\u00a0\nThe gala \u2014 Red Carpet For A Cause \u2014 supported the Sickle Cell Disease Association of America's Philadelphia and Delaware Valley Chapter. The night included catered food, live performances from student groups like The Inspiration, wonderful community, and beautiful decor\u2014even including an ice sculpture of the DAAP logo. Over $1,700 was raised in support of the foundation.\n\t\t\t\tSEE MORE FROM MIA VESELY:\ufeffI dropped sorority rush and I\u2019m gladFirst Liz Magill, next free speechWhen asked about the impacts of the event, College sophomore and DAAP founding member Clarke Dickens said, \u201cWe wanted to bring the community together for a great cause, especially a cause that affects a lot of African Americans and Black people more broadly.\u201d\nSickle cell disease occurs in about one in every 365 Black babies born in the United States. The percentage of Black people who carry the trait is even higher, with one in 13 Black babies being born as carriers.\n\tDickens is not just involved with DAAP, but is also on the boards for QBlack and Shea Collective.\nThese clubs are all part of something commonly dubbed \u201cBlack Penn,\u201d which focuses on so many different aspects of identity. From cultural organizations like Penn African Student Association (PASA), to preprofessional organizations like Black Wharton and the Black Pre-Law Association (BPLA), to community service organizations like the NAACP, all of these organizations put an emphasis on service both inside the Penn community and out.\u00a0\nFor example, Campus Curlz \u2014 a club I serve on the board of \u2014 is, at first glance, a club centered around uplifting natural hair and embracing positivity. \u00a0But underlying hair mask making events and movie nights, there is a strong commitment to service. Just this month, the community service committee held an event where we made Valentine\u2019s Day cards for senior citizens at Mercy Life West Philadelphia.\nService by board members is a requirement to be part of funding organizations like UMOJA \u2014 the umbrella funding organization for Black clubs \u2014 and even beyond that, many clubs center service in every activity they partake in. Whether you\u2019re on the board of a club or not, there are many service opportunities available and encouraged.\nWhen asked what they wish people knew about Black Penn, Dickens said, \u201cClubs should make an effort to include grad students, it makes all the difference. I\u2019m able to say, \u2018This is what I would look like coming here for grad school,\u2019 and it can even offer opportunities for mentorship.\u201d\nWhat seems to drive Black Penn is first and foremost the students, then the supportive and involved faculty, as well as the local partnerships and opportunities the clubs find, build, and pursue for themselves. Many members of the DAAP board are native to Philadelphia, so that makes their work even more personal.\nWhile Black students do take initiative to realize what they need and create the spaces they want to see, there is so much room for improvement on behalf of Penn: whether it\u2019s stratifying the way funding is given to these clubs \u2014 they often can\u2019t fund silverware in UMOJA meetings if it can be provided elsewhere \u2014 or improving the cultural spaces available to students (we were promised the ARCH \u2018building,\u2019 not the ARCH \u2018basement\u2019). In months like February, Penn aims to spotlight their Black students. I just wish this recognition of the incredible community Black students forged for themselves, when they initially didn\u2019t see it on campus, came year-round.\n\t\tGet our newsletter, DP Daybreak, delivered to your inbox every weekday morning.Events like DAAP's gala happen every month, and it\u2019s important not to understate the role these organizations play in making Penn a welcoming and accepting place for students from marginalized backgrounds.\nI was happy to see Faces of Black Penn \u2014 a Black-run publication \u2014 highlighted in the DP last week. I hope people continue to uplift the work of these student groups going forward and make space to give all students their roses. Black History Month is not over, and the time to appreciate Black students and their work does not end come March.\nMIA VESELY is a College sophomore studying philosophy, politics, and economics from Phoenix, A.Z.

          "title": "Bernadine Kumi | I joined a sorority and I\u2019m glad",
          "article_content": "I\u2019ll be honest: I was not a fan of Greek life when I first got to Penn. My perception of Greek life was influenced by growing up in the South, mainly in suburban Georgia. This included a sorority scene of girls with fake spray tans and little to no personality. The images of sorority girls from the University of Georgia and Alabama screamed no diversity, which made me wary of joining a sorority at Penn. Being a First-Generation, Low-Income (FGLI) student made me especially hesitant. Even more so, coming from a Ghanaian household, the notion of a sorority was immediately dismissed as something against our Christian values. Thus, during my first year, I knew I would never, and I mean never, join a sorority.\u00a0\nHowever, by the beginning of sophomore year, my mindset began to change. After a year on campus, I had found a solid community of a small group of friends. But beyond that, I felt that I did not really know anyone. I couldn\u2019t name more than 20 people in my grade. Penn is known for being a networking school, and the \u201cSocial Ivy,\u201d so I began to question just how much I had taken advantage of that. That, along with most of the underclassmen party scene revolving around fraternities, made the idea of rushing even more appealing.\u00a0\n\t\tSo while most people were beginning their sophomore year with the friends they already had, I began to look for additional friends. My twin sister, who also goes to Penn, and I began attending open rush events, talking to sophomores in sororities, and involving ourselves in more social events. Over the next few months, my days consisted of talking to many girls, going to dinners, and putting myself out there in a way that I had been hesitant to do before. I made new friends, met fellow sophomores also in search of a bigger community, and found myself loving the idea of joining a sorority.\u00a0\nBut what made me even more eager was just how inclusive and diverse sororities were at Penn, more so than I had been expecting\u2014especially the off-campus sorority I ended up joining, OAX. I was still wary about rushing, but as soon as I got to the first event, I immediately felt comfortable. There were girls with different interests, passions, economic backgrounds, and personalities. Not a single conversation felt forced. Every girl I met had a unique and authentic story, and I felt like I could talk to them for hours.\n\t\t\t\tSEE MORE FROM BERNADINE KUMI:\ufeffDining hall workers at Penn Hillel demand better treatment from UniversityI was especially captivated by BLOAX (Black OAX), a community within OAX that includes fellow girls of Ghanaian descent and other Black girls who provided me with guidance on navigating Penn as a Black woman. OAX also has other smaller communities, such as LatinOAX and RainbOAX. Being able to find other people with similar backgrounds made the choice to join a sorority that much easier.\u00a0\nAs a FGLI student and Questbridge scholar, the idea of paying high dues out of my minimal work paychecks every month was unfathomable. I knew that joining a sorority would pose another financial burden, and even though I was loving the OAX community, the idea of paying dues scared me. Yet once again, OAX and other sororities surprised me with their understanding and financial transparency. They worked with me to develop an affordable monthly payment plan so that I, like every other girl interested in rushing, could also enjoy being in a sorority.\u00a0\n\tSince the morning of Bid Day when I got \u201cthe call,\u201d I know that I truly made the right decision by joining a sorority, for not only my social life but my professional life too. This past fall, I was able to land a summer internship in Los Angeles with the help of my grand-big. I was also able to prepare for my interview with girls in my sorority, who gave me the confidence I needed to land the opportunity. As a Black woman and FGLI student, I have truly benefited from joining Greek life. I hope students who are hesitant to rush, just as I once was, will see my experience and how transformative it can be. I hope others \u2014 whether they are Black women, FGLI students, or just Penn students in search of a greater community \u2014 can do the same.\nBERNADINE KUMI is a College junior studying political science and legal studies and history from Roswell, Ga.

          "title": "Jessey Shin | \u201cWhy is your pre-major advisor so much better than mine?\u201d",
          "article_content": "Columnist Jessey Shin explores the problem of disparate advising quality in the College and argues \nfor a more standardized experience.\u201cMy advisor lied to me?\u201d\nI remember someone saying this to me in complete disbelief, but I can\u2019t say I\u2019m surprised. Advisors can be as misleading as they are helpful, and this is a widespread problem that needs addressing.\n\t\tIn the College, students typically have between 15 and 20 credits outside of their primary major to meet the graduation requirement. These are used to fulfill general education requirements, pursue a second major or minor, or take elective courses that align with a student\u2019s interests.\nThe freedom to pursue one\u2019s intellectual pursuits is, of course, one of the draws of the College. I am looking to pursue two majors myself, in somewhat interconnected but disparate fields of study: the flexibility offered by the curriculum allows me to explore these interests without taking an obscene number of classes.\n\t\t\t\tSEE MORE FROM JESSEY SHIN:Making a case for the less popular college housesNavigating the maze of Penn's resources\ufeffThe problem is few students go into their first year knowing which major they would like to pursue, much less exactly which courses to take.\u00a0\nThe College puts a lot of effort into informing incoming students about the curriculum and what they have to offer, such as through the Compass module on Canvas that gives a foray into some aspects of the College experience (something that other schools do not offer). However, the sheer number of options can be overwhelming, giving rise to a unique need for personalized, one-on-one guidance. This is where pre-major advisors come in.\u00a0\n\tPre-major advisors, assigned to each student before they start their first semester at Penn, are a vital resource for College students. They guide students through the course selection process, encouraging and helping them as they explore their various interests and eventually settle on a major.\nI can say that I have had a relatively good experience with my pre-major advisor. However, I also found that some of the advice offered was not fully applicable to my circumstance, because of the recent transition from Penn InTouch to Path@Penn.\nOther students, however, are not as lucky. I have heard stories about advisors making their students cry, spreading misinformation, jeopardizing their advisees\u2019 course registration, you name it.\nIn an interview, one student (who requested anonymity) shared that they have had trouble reaching their pre-major advisor from the get-go. College students must meet with their advisor one-on-one to get their course registration hold lifted; without this, they are not eligible to participate in advance registration. The student was only able to reach their advisor a day or so before the deadline and has continued to have trouble with availability.\nOf course, their pre-major advisor experience was less than ideal. \u201cHer guidance wasn\u2019t so much guidance as it was looking at the boxes and seeing if I checked them,\u201d they said. \u201cI don\u2019t think I would feel comfortable going to her for personal issues, such as which major to pursue or how to explore [some of my interests], because I don\u2019t think she would point me [in] the right direction.\u201d Instead, they had been utilizing their PennCAP advisor (available for FGLI students) for these concerns.\nOn the other hand, some students are able to form a positive relationship with their advisor and find that they are helpful in navigating their interests. Rishi Dadlani, a College first year, described his advisor as \u201cfriendly and helpful. He gave me his phone number and told me to contact him if I [had] any questions \u2026 If I saw him around campus, I would say hi, and he always sends us a beginning-of-semester email.\u201d\n\t\tGet our newsletter, DP Daybreak, delivered to your inbox every weekday morning.This disparity in advising quality means that some students are at a great disadvantage compared to others. While some advisors are able to \u201cpoint students in the right direction,\u201d helping them take the right step forward in their college experience, others fall short. Their advisees must navigate the complicated process of learning about the majors, gen-ed requirements, and figuring out (the surprisingly difficult) advance registration process on their own.\nWhen done right, the freedom of the College curriculum can allow students to truly delve into their academic interests and eventually settle on the right path for them. However, that process requires a lot of research and planning that is supposed to be aided by a pre-major advisor. For incoming first years who are unfamiliar with the landscape at Penn and underclassmen students, this disparity in advising quality poses a challenge. Penn must ensure that all students are able to best utilize the resources at their disposal, and the first place to start is with the guidance they receive.\nJESSEY SHIN is a College first-year studying sociology and communications from Seongnam-si, South Korea.

          "article_content": "Guest Columnist Raheem Williams recommends three books for the Penn community to engage with this Black History Month.Dear Fellow Quakers,\nAs we celebrate Black History Month, it's crucial to recognize the multifaceted nature of the Black American experience. This month offers an opportunity to delve into the depths of history: exploring narratives that challenge, inspire, and provoke thought. In the spirit of true academic inquiry and in honor of this significant month, I wish to highlight a selection of works by Black authors whose perspectives might diverge from the more commonly embraced interpretations of Black history and culture.\n\t\tIn recommending these texts, my intention is not to endorse every opinion expressed by the authors, but to underscore the importance of engaging with a diversity of viewpoints. These authors challenge us to look beyond the prevailing orthodoxy and to question the narratives that have become commonplace within academic circles. They remind us that the Black American experience, like any aspect of human history, is richly diverse and complex.\nAs members of an academic community that prides itself on intellectual rigor and openness, it is our responsibility to explore a broad spectrum of perspectives, especially those that provoke debate and reflection. Let us take this Black History Month as an opportunity to broaden our horizons, engage with ideas that challenge us, and appreciate the rich tapestry of narratives that comprise Black history in America.\n\t\t\t\tRAHEEM WILLIAMS is an Executive MPA student at the Fels Institute of Government and a member of the Committee on Open Expression.
