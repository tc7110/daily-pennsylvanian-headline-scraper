          "title": "Zara Tena | You should take an ethics class at Penn",
          "article_content": "This semester, I somehow ended up with four out of my five classes being either directly or indirectly about ethics. As a political science major, I was really excited to take these classes, since whenever people talk about ethics nowadays, it mostly has to do with politics or international relations.\nAt a time when our reality changes so rapidly because of technology, and when we are faced with a number of global challenges, some people have forgotten about the importance of acting morally. Especially at a place like Penn, where everyone seems to be extremely worried about their future and their careers, people often disregard these values when they are caught up by the competitive environment. Because of this, one would think that ethics classes would be extremely beneficial for all, but do they actually contribute to making students more ethical individuals?\n\t\tAccording to my professors, they don\u2019t.\nIn all four ethics classes, my professors started the semester by telling us that ethics classes will not make most of us more ethical. I sat there, listening to all of them, and I just could not understand why they would say something like that. If I wasn\u2019t going to learn anything, what was the point of taking these classes?\n\t\t\t\tSEE MORE FROM ZARA TENA:The urgent need for younger voices in politics\ufeffIt\u2019s okay to be ordinaryThat\u2019s where I was wrong: I have been learning a lot. While perhaps the main goal of ethics classes is not to turn students into more ethical people, they definitely give us the tools we need to critically engage with ethical dilemmas. By taking these classes, I might not become a better person, but they have given me a space where I can explore, discuss, and reflect about where I stand on so many issues and what my beliefs about morality actually are.\nEthics is not a subject that can be forcefully taught through lectures and readings. There is no way that we can sit down for three hours every week and magically become more ethical just because we memorize theories and read long papers written by old white men. The goal of these classes is not to tell us what is \u2018right\u2019 or \u2018wrong,\u2019 \u00a0but to give us the skills to navigate the gray areas in ethical decision making.\n\tThese classes encourage self reflection and personal growth. Even when analyzing big case studies or exploring different theories, students are pushed to question their own values, beliefs, and biases. While this may not guarantee that we will completely transform our moral compasses, the self awareness that comes from these reflections creates a great foundation for understanding why we act the way we do and also invites us to try to understand others.\nThe fact that ethics classes begin with a warning \u2014 that you won\u2019t become more ethical by taking them \u2014 should not stop anyone from giving them a chance. The ability to think critically, understand different values and perspectives, and have the skills to self reflect are essential parts of any college education. They prepare students for the complicated moral dilemmas they might face in their personal and professional lives \u2014 especially when most people at Penn will end up with jobs that are notorious for their ethical scandals!\nZARA TENA is a College sophomore studying political science from Puebla, Mexico.

          "article_content": "How many times have you found yourself in a never-ending cycle of back-and-forth messages, trying to pin down a date for a long overdue catch up with a friend? Every get together begins to feel as if it requires intricate planning and strips away the simplicity of social connection. This routine becomes stifling, lacking spontaneity and authenticity; you\u2019re constrained to coordinating with the same faces in the same places.\u00a0\nThis is what I like to call scheduling fatigue.\u00a0\n\t\tAs a result of this phenomenon, gatherings among friends are beginning to resemble scheduled business meetings, meticulously arranged via tools like When2Meet or synchronized Google Calendars.\nWhile resorting to scheduling may seem like the only viable option to maintain a semblance of social connection, perhaps it's time to embrace the idea of venturing out solo: I\u2019m challenging you to go on an unplanned side quest all by yourself to a third place.\u00a0\n\t\t\t\tMORE FROM LALA MUSTAFA:A nation on defense: Dismantling misinformation against Azerbaijan in the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict\ufeff\ufeffAllow me to explain. Picture the first place as your home and the second as your place of education or work. Now, the third place emerges as a public sphere where individuals congregate, not out of any obligation like in the previously mentioned locations, but, for lack of a more precise term, to simply vibe. It could be the cozy corner of a cafe, a communal park, or even the neighborhood barbershop \u2014 anywhere that\u2019ll allow you to interact with people outside your usual circles.\u00a0\nYet, at many universities like Penn, the concept of a third place seems all but lost as our lives remain restricted to school grounds, causing even our first and second places to converge into one. While spots on campus \u2014 like Stommons, Pret, or the cultural centers in ARCH \u2014 can offer some respite, they often come with the latent pressure of being on the clock. Conversations here revolve around assignments, internships, and the intricacies of Penn culture. The chances of an unexpected encounter dwindle given that most people in attendance will be other Penn students. As we\u2019re cocooned in the Penn bubble, it comes as no surprise that many students spend their four years in Philadelphia without ever fully exploring it.\u00a0\n\tYet, this insulation comes at a cost that extends far beyond what we realize.\u00a0\nIt severs our connection not only from the outside world but also from ourselves. That is, within such limits, our individuality dwindles, reducing us to mere roles influenced by our peers. By excluding ourselves from a wider social sphere, we inhibit opportunities to engage with diverse perspectives, trap ourselves in a cycle of familiarity, and risk leading monotonous lives that pave the way to burnout.\nHowever, in our lives, both intimacy and affiliation with broader communities are essential. While intimacy often stems from our immediate circles, affiliation thrives in third places where spontaneous interactions occur. These spaces facilitate easy contact with new individuals on a regular basis, without the need for prior scheduling. As they consistently offer an opportunity for interaction with others, they end up cultivating the most reliable form of socialization.\u00a0\nSo, if you are keen on exploring new horizons and getting involved in the Philadelphia community, I suggest checking out the many informative articles dedicated to bursting the Penn bubble.\nNevertheless, I want to avoid confining third places to physical locations. They\u2019re more of a mindset, a willingness to embrace spontaneity wherever it may arise. They don't have to be far from campus or require spending money. Instead, third places can be any informal spots you visit \u2014 whether it's your student lounge, the library, or a community center.\u00a0\n\t\tGet our newsletter, DP Daybreak, delivered to your inbox every weekday morning.We often find ourselves caught up in the routines of daily life, clinging to familiar patterns of scheduling and social interaction.

          "title": "Beatriz B\u00e1ez | No closed captioning available",
          "article_content": "Columnist Beatriz B\u00e1ez explains her experience with language fatigue at Penn.On my first day at Penn, I called my father in distress, telling him I needed to move back home and study there as I was going to die alone at this university. My father asked why, and I quickly responded, \u201cI haven\u2019t met anybody in three hours. I have no friends. It\u2019s over for me.\u201d\u00a0\nThat very same night, I went to a New Student Orientation event at Houston Hall. As I nervously paced the floor in my Crocs, I overheard some students speaking Spanish and immediately gravitated toward them. Confessing, \u201cI heard Spanish, and I feel saved,\u201d I ended up meeting three genuine individuals, all from various parts of Latin America. Having arrived in the United States, it felt comforting to hear voices that reminded me of home. This comfort is priceless in such a foreign environment.\n\t\tAll my life, I\u2019ve taken courses in Spanish, spoken Spanish at home, and been berated by my grandmother whenever I spoke too much English. Arriving at Penn, I didn\u2019t anticipate the struggle I would face taking classes taught in English, as I had been lucky enough to have been extensively taught English from a very young age.\nBut speaking in a second language most of the time, even as a fluent speaker, is incredibly draining. Meeting native Spanish speakers at Penn was truly a blessing. However, I have found that some people react adversely to me speaking my primary language. These are not continuous reactions of a high degree, but there have been enough small instances to mark me.\u00a0\n\t\t\t\tMORE ON THIS TOPIC:Students celebrate 40th annual Festival Latinx, honoring Latinx culture on campusLa Casa Latina celebrates 2023 Latinx Heritage Month at PennOn various occasions, I have had Latinx friends say, \u201cLet\u2019s speak English so X person doesn\u2019t feel excluded,\u201d or even resort to English for \u201cconvenience\u201d when we\u2019re alone. For the former, I understand the sentiment. I wouldn\u2019t want someone to be excluded from a conversation in such a way. However, when I\u2019m naturally speaking Spanish, having my speech interpreted as a personal offense is off-putting.\u00a0\nIn one instance, I met a student through a mutual friend on a night out. This friend and I speak fluent Spanish; the person I had just met did not. Throughout the night, I had various conversations with my new acquaintance \u2014 who I found quite amicable \u2014 and my friend. I would naturally speak Spanish with the latter, not thinking much of it. The next morning, my friend told me how the new acquaintance felt I hated them for speaking Spanish in front of them, knowing they didn\u2019t speak the language.\u00a0\n\tI was shocked by the assumption and, in all honesty, a little offended. I found it quite conceited that one would think another person is speaking in their first language to actively exclude them. Speaking in a first language, for me, is purely a relief issue. Although I am fluent in English, after an entire week of speaking it, it can be extremely draining; thus, particularly in a social setting, I don\u2019t want to add to the exhaustion.\u00a0\nIt is more than fine to be curious about what somebody is saying and ask for a translation. However, immediately expressing discomfort upon hearing another language and presuming the other person is talking badly about you is inconsiderate toward them. More often than not, this language switch is for comfort. This was the first of sufficient instances that exposed a pattern in my time at Penn. In another class, I grew close to a few other Spanish-speaking students. One of them continuously suggested we switch back to English for seemingly no valid reason and would reply to any comment of mine in English.\u00a0\nThis harsh reality on campus expands into the club scene. In one instance, a native English speaker attended a club meeting primarily led in Spanish. Within this meeting, if club members asked questions in Spanish, any other members who answered quickly switched to English. Evidently, the intent is to have everybody be able to partake in conversation. However, members within a Spanish-led group should be able to detach from English formalities within club meetings, particularly if the club seeks to embrace Latinx heritage.\u00a0\nSpeaking in my primary language is the greatest manifestation of my culture, particularly since Spanish accents are so diverse throughout Latin America. Having to switch to English not only in academic settings but in seemingly every other sphere of Penn life further disconnects me from the culture I\u2019ve been surrounded by my entire life until now. This applies to any person whose main language isn\u2019t English, not only to Spanish speakers.\u00a0\n\t\tGet our newsletter, DP Daybreak, delivered to your inbox every weekday morning.Penn has students from over 100 countries, with around 19% of the student body being international. If one truly wants to immerse themselves in Penn\u2019s multilingual community, one needs to recognize that a language barrier works both ways. Just as an English speaker may be tired from learning another language, a non-English speaker can be drained from constantly speaking English. It\u2019s crucial to recognize that for the latter, multilingualism surpasses a simple language requirement and spills over to nearly every sector of their life at Penn.\u00a0\nLanguage fatigue is a true reality, especially for individuals who haven\u2019t learned English from a young age. Thus, if somebody within your social group is speaking their first language, which you are not fluent in, it does not give you the right to feel offended or urge them to speak in a tongue you understand. And, if you are a non-native English speaker, as much as you can, \"habla en tu primer idioma y que los dem\u00e1s se ubiquen.\"\nBEATRIZ B\u00c1EZ is a College first year studying mathematics and political science from San Juan, Puerto Rico.

And, if white is a moral choice, there is an enormous challenge: then you're challenging an entire civilization,\u201d said James Baldwin.\nWhiteness is the myth we\u2019ve been sold and under which we live. In our instruction at the University of Pennsylvania, we were told to reach for safety and to secure our decadence. So are the students now, but they are not nearly as certain that this is the road they\u2019d really like to walk. The students I knew have already paid that price for that ticket, and their horizons, on a human level, look bleak.\u00a0\n\t\tPhiladelphia is not a college town. It is a real city, a Black city, a poor city whose reality reflects the depth of the American crisis and yet contains the possibilities of its salvation. From the soil of this city rose heroes like Teddy Pendergrass, The Delfonics, McCoy Tyner, and Alfie Pollitt. A friend, then a nursing student who had packed her bags for New York City after graduation and returned a few years later to work in the hospitals, remarked on her return, \"Philadelphia has soul.\"\u00a0\nIn the five years since I\u2019ve graduated, the tone of campus has shifted. Students are developing a new language in order to deal with existential questions: What is the purpose of education and the responsibility of students in the wake of war? More than in my time, it is now clear that we, the students, want to be free. The crisis is deepening, and history is accelerating.\n\t\t\n\t\nFewer illusions are possible for the young mind in Philadelphia, which tempers and sharpens it like metal on metal. What the path to whiteness and an invented safety then produces is a delusional and unfree state. My peers, who are banking, coding, and consulting their lives away, are living as prisoners to the choices they\u2019ve made.\u00a0\nAll the beauty, genius, and potential I witnessed when we were young together, freshman year before the vicious teeth of Penn successfully \u201csocialized\u201d most of us, has been wasted, whittled down into dust, and lost. My old friends might have money, but they didn\u2019t manage to save their souls, and some part of them knows this fact \u2014 that they are perishing. We were never meant to become the fools and tools of the mythic America: the one that is superior, war-hungry, greedy, and hypocritical. These choices did their damage. That was an aberration. Now, we are entering a time of correction.\u00a0\n\tWe want to know the meaning of our lives when we live in a country whose hand assassinates a man and poet as beautiful and courageous as Refaat Alareer, when we live in a society in which Aaron Bushnell had to die so that humanity could live. When the youngest students of Philadelphia stand to say they are no different from the children of Palestine, that the bombs dropped abroad also explode in our neighborhoods, we then know it is true for ourselves \u2014 that we bleed the same as these children in Palestine, as all the men and women we encounter in Philadelphia.\u00a0\nOur bondage to the genocide in Gaza is through the struggle to become moral human beings in America, and to relinquish our country from the myths that strangle us and our people.\u00a0\nIt is unmistakable that the education Penn offers is bankrupt, and that some cancer, invisible but detectable, poisons our relationships to each other and to ourselves. The scramble for acceptance into mediocre clubs and fraternities is insufferable, and the false authority these groups stand on in order to make these judgments is embarrassing.

To investigate and challenge the standards of their education, peers, and professors. And to then act and live by these new definitions, through which we will discover freedom. The world makes us, and we make it, too.\u00a0\nIf we were meant to become the leaders of this country and makers of history, as so many of us have been told from youth into maturity \u2014 that we are capable of this \u2014 then this is our role to fulfill: a brave, original, and purposeful life that skirts the frontier of new standards for this nation.

          "title": "Hanadi Abdulkadir | How poor dining hall food shapes our mental and academic capabilities",
          "article_content": "At this point, many Penn students have lived the terrible dining stories at a number of halls across campus. While it\u2019s important to discuss the health and sanitary risks associated with some of these concerns, it\u2019s also necessary to break down how this problem factors into students\u2019 academic and mental well-being.\u00a0\nOpening Sidechat every few days to see yet another picture of undercooked meat or hearing horror stories from my friends dissuades me from trekking across campus to eat at many of our dining halls. Oftentimes, I find myself skipping meals or stretching the time out between each one \u2014 until I accept the fact that I\u2019ll be eating the same food I already ate a couple times that week. Does this mean that I\u2019m probably missing out on some of the necessary vitamins or fiber I should be getting daily? Probably.\n\t\tNumerous Penn Dining Wellness emails live in our inboxes with tips on improving digestive health and practicing better healthy habits in our daily lives. Additionally, the official page for Penn Dining boasts awards and recognitions for sustainability and top college dining. However, the pristine and glossy promotional pictures of sandwiches, smoothies, and breakfast bowls tell a completely different story from the reality on campus.\nWith two of the most historical repeat offenders \u2014 Hill House and 1920 Commons \u2014 being the only consistent options available for on campus dining during the weekend, it\u2019s much more convenient to resort to the other retail spots scattered around campus. However, some of these locations are far apart, depending on where you live, and can add additional costs to weekly expenses. \u00a0\n\t\t\t\tSEE MORE FROM HANADI ABDULKADIR:\ufeffPenn should require an African American history courseWhy social media and Palestinian activism goes hand in handAdditionally, for students who are dishing out a hefty sum of money to enroll in the dining plan, going out of their way to seek expensive alternatives takes away money that could\u2019ve been better spent elsewhere. Considering that first years and sophomores are required to pick a dining plan for their first two years at Penn, it\u2019s no wonder that students have consistently called for the food standards to match the high prices of these meal swipes. Ideally, no student should feel like they need to resort to options outside of Penn; rather, outside options should be supplemental to an already quality level of options at all dining halls.\u00a0\nSince coming to Penn, my relationship with food has become much more complex. I need to look twice when picking out a seemingly clean utensil to eat whatever is on my plate or stare extra hard at my salad with suspicion before consuming it. But growing up, food was always a way for me to connect with my family and friends, to bring us back together even when we hadn\u2019t seen each other in a long time. Yet the food at Penn, at its worst, has left me frustrated and succeeded at suppressing my appetite \u2014 something I actually can relate to other students about.\n\tAlthough certain foods are scientifically linked to improving mental clarity and focus, I hesitate in reaching for those vegetables because they don\u2019t look as fresh or appetizing when lined up on display in Kings Court English House. As a result, I look for short-term solutions in coffee, which leaves me feeling tired earlier in the day or exhausted while trying to tackle my assignments at night. In order to meet my immediate deadlines, I prioritize some assignments over others, meaning some classes suffer in academic performance and perpetuate an almost never-ending cycle of playing catch-up. I believe that the root cause of all these problems can be traced back to the lack of decent dining.\u00a0\nThis same sentiment has been echoed by many of my friends and peers. But the dining quality at Penn can be mitigated if the University addresses the root problem. Whether that be promoting clean and sanitary workspaces when handling food or streamlining student complaints to Penn Dining other than through email, the University can restore student faith in the system. When it comes to campus dining, Penn can improve upon our experiences by implementing the changes that students deserve to enjoy, especially at the height of midterm season.\nHANADI ABDULKADIR is a College sophomore studying international relations from Philadelphia.

          "article_content": "During Penn\u2019s recent administrative upheaval, the University community found an unexpected silver lining: For the first time, Penn was making headlines alongside Harvard and MIT.\u00a0\nThe presidents of these three institutions were at the center of an infamous congressional hearing in December after their alleged missteps on campus antisemitism. I\u2019ll admit, there is something far more distasteful about chaos at the Capitol than the collective HYPSM prestige.\n\t\tBut many of us are taking our education at Penn for granted, shedding our \u201cque ser\u00e1, ser\u00e1\u201d optimism, and wondering at times what it would be like to go to a more recognizable Ivy. For decades, we\u2019ve all but exhausted our morale by clarifying to passersby that no, Penn State and Penn are not the same university. And yes, Penn is actually active in areas outside of Wharton\u2019s finance programs.\nSo, when Penn Engineering announced its new undergraduate program in artificial intelligence, many of us were enthusiastic about the University\u2019s growing role in the innovation sector: a space thought to be dominated by less business-oriented institutions.\n\t\t\t\tSEE MORE FROM MRITIKA SENTHIL: Removing legacy admissions will align Penn\u2019s actions more closely with its educational missionWhy changing leadership won\u2019t eliminate antisemitism at PennBut Penn\u2019s realization, of possibly its most practical initiative, begs the question: Is the University actually necessary in DevOps? Does sitting in a classroom \u2014 let alone one that\u2019s in the midst of a campus known for its influx of finance bros \u2014 really supersede what can be MacGyvered by a tech junkie with only a laptop, caffeine, and time? I want to give a definite \u201cno.\u201d Otherwise, I would need to hold my classmates and myself accountable for upholding all the exclusivity that comes with attending Penn. And yet, there are a frustrating number of anonymous netizens, D-list journalists, and LinkedIn bards who call Ivy League universities like Penn \u201cout of touch\u201d \u2014 remnants of centuries-old American elitism in an era of bottom-up grassroots movements.\nOne C-suite executive anticipates that \u201cthe best AI engineers and builders won\u2019t graduate Penn Engineering. They'll be global, builders and in the right group chats.\u201d His readers agree, with one commenter further emphasizing that \u201cuniversities cannot keep up with the pace of free market innovation.\u201d When these schools attempt to go against the grain and align with consumer needs, \u201cit genuinely looks embarrassing and out of date.\u201d\n\tIn an environment where the use of AI models is largely democratized, we\u2019re naturally drawn to the trope of a layperson who forgoes bureaucratic systems to channel their intelligence: creating life-changing inventions that would have never come to be under self-serving corporate and political influences. And when ignoring cases of succor \u2014 as mainstream media unfortunately does \u2014 there are many examples of such successes. Bill Gates and Paul Allen, co-founders of Microsoft, were university dropouts. So were Meta Platforms co-founders Mark Zuckerberg and Dustin Moskovitz. As Penn\u2019s over reliance on donors came to light earlier this school year, critics of the upper crust have continued to group Penn with other perpetrators of social stratification. The field of AI is, by nature, continuously evolving. And limiting growth in the discipline to those who can afford, and then succeed in Penn\u2019s Department of Computer and Information Science courses is counterproductive.\nHowever, these narratives misrepresent the intentions of Penn\u2019s AI program.\nTo make a better case for Penn\u2019s AI major, I spoke with Robert Ghrist, Andrea Mitchell Professor and associate dean for undergraduate education at Penn Engineering. He describes how the process of integrating AI in education is similar to the effects of increasing access to music recording and playback technologies. Now, there is \u201cmore music for everyone at much lower prices,\u201d he told me. Nonetheless, \u201cartists at the very top of the industry\u201d are increasingly the benefactors of \u201ca concentration of rewards.\u201d Taylor Swift is, as any current news feed can attest to, perhaps the most prolific embodiment of such phenomena. And professor Ghrist strives to make Penn an incubator of sorts for the \u201cTaylor Swifts of AI\u201d that seek avenues for academic growth, to actually be the \u201cleading edge where the best thrive.\u201d\nAnd to thrive in this discipline, aspiring AI mavens are off course by simply memorizing browser instructions in JavaScript and praying for a tech equivalent of the coveted Goldman Sachs internship. After all, studying AI is a philosophical pursuit: an inquiry into the nature of consciousness and ethics of creating sentient machines. It\u2019s also a political pursuit, for AI poses challenges in regulatory compliance. There are countless possible liabilities for even the most basic ChatGPT input, such as unprotected user data and violations of intellectual property rights. \u00a0\n\t\tGet our newsletter, DP Daybreak, delivered to your inbox every weekday morning.Needless to say, as you might have noticed in my earlier columns, I am not an AI major. I\u2019m not even enrolled in Penn Engineering. Am I, of all students, in the right to quash critics of the Penn AI major when I dropped AP Computer Science in high school (with no regrets)?\nYet, it\u2019s clearly irresponsible to follow the well-intentioned advice from tech capitalists when constant innovation is not particularly ideal for society. Maybe I\u2019m just afraid of a \"Black Mirror\"-esque dystopia, but there is a kind of ominous quality to the idea of highly skilled AI scientists off the reins. Penn, however, is cultivating an ecosystem that nurtures AI talent, albeit not by stifling the next Elon Musk or Sam Altman with red-tape-ridden academics; instead, Penn fosters ethically conscious innovation that addresses complex societal challenges. And so, the fact that I can engage with the Penn curricula across departments has a surprising beauty. The opportunity to become a part of this technological movement \u2014 or, dare I say, revolution \u2014 is the gift of studying AI at Penn.\nMRITIKA SENTHIL is a first year studying management and Russian and east European studies from Columbia, S.C.

Majoring in AI panders to the pre-professionalism Penn is known for and removes many of the foundational elements of the field that underlie innovation.\u00a0\nIn an interesting recent LinkedIn post, David Magerman pondered the implications of a university building complete undergraduate curriculums around a \u201cmodern business tool that is a niche application of computer science, diverting students away from a broad education in computer science.\u201d He went on to ask pointedly, \u201cWhat's next? A Bachelor of Arts in Blogging from the Annenberg School? A Wharton BS in Quantitative Trading?\u201d\n\t\t\t\tSEE MORE FROM AKIVA BERKOWITZ:The newsletter is dead\ufeffIsrael under attack: What do you stand for?As a current computer science major, I\u2019ll admit the AI curriculum looks fascinating. There is such an array of eye-catching electives (from Deep Generative Models to Natural Language Processing) that, if I were doing my degree all over again, I suspect I would have been swayed to switch into the major. But as a recently graduated computer and information science friend put it, the degree \u201cseems like the cool parts of CIS\u201d without the heavier basics like operating systems, computer systems, and physics \u2014 building blocks on the entire computer domain. \u00a0\nThe question I ask myself is whether artificial intelligence is really enough of an independent field that it transcends computer science and necessitates its own major. Is the relatively new field of AI established enough, broad enough, and unique enough such that the skills we gain through taking just those mostly career-focused courses today will undoubtedly remain relevant in 30 years and justify the $84,600 a year sticker price? I simply wonder how likely it may be that AI will become so unrecognizable in 20 or even 10 years, given its breakneck pace of innovation, that students may have wished that their majors in college focused on more fundamental elements of the field that innovators keep turning back to for insight.\u00a0\n\tAside from long-term career effectiveness an AI degree would have compared to computer science or electrical engineering, Penn is known for its pre-professional student body, and this new major shows signs of that sentiment leaking into the curriculum as well. In contrast to the Penn Integrates Knowledge professorships that bring in academic leaders who deeply understand multiple fields to better spark insight between them, this new major filters various courses of study to pluck out the elements we find valuable today.\u00a0\nIn this line of thinking, maybe we should consider the true value of a groundbreaking Wharton degree in quant trading that would promise to \u201csculpt the financial moguls of tomorrow\u201d with unparalleled prowess in algorithmic trading strategies and quantitative analysis.\u00a0\nAll this is to say, I immediately understand the value the current AI concentration within the larger CIS curriculum has. And I appreciate the Ph.D. programs that take students to a higher level of understanding, once they\u2019ve taken the time in their undergraduate training to build the broad foundations. I simply remain curious of the true value an AI undergraduate degree offers us as students over other forms of study within the field and the certain level of indulgence in pre-professionalism that it plays into on Penn\u2019s campus. I truly hope that I\u2019m proven wrong.\nAKIVA BERKOWITZ is an Engineering junior studying computer science from Silver Spring, Md.

          "title": "Eric Najera | Penn must take action to enhance the dining experience",
          "article_content": "As busy college students, most of us do not have time to cook our own meals, and if you are anything like me, cooking is far from your forte. The hassle of having to go to the grocery store, cook, and clean can be time consuming and even more difficult when you\u2019re overwhelmed with classes, clubs, and homework. For the many students without access to a kitchen in their dorm, this presents an even bigger challenge. Luckily, college campuses have dining halls! Students simply swipe their card to get access to an all-you-care-to-eat dining experience. Dining halls provide easy access meals to students\u2014but what happens when that food is inedible?\nAs a picky eater, I know that simply because I do not like a dish does not mean it is unsafe to eat, but food with cockroaches and glass is unsafe for anyone. A seemingly obvious underlying assumption in dining is that food is safe to eat. College dining halls should be a place where students go to eat well-cooked, hairless, and insect-free food. However, that is not the case at Penn: There is a lack of responsibility to make sure the food is meeting basic standards for, let alone satisfying, all students.\u00a0\n\t\tMeal plans are far from cheap. For the sticker price, students would expect quality food, but they would be wrong. Both of the first-year student meal plan options cost $6,330, with the maximum amount of swipes being 296. Each meal swipe equates to roughly $17, which is about the same price as a Caniac Combo at Raising Cane's. As previously stated, Penn dining hall food is far from gourmet, and its price is too high for the quality delivered.\u00a0\nExpensive dining plan meals are not unique to Penn, but other Ivy League schools have similar prices for better quality food. Cornell University offers an unlimited meal plan, so students may visit the dining halls as much as they want with a fixed cost of $6,942 for food ranked second-best in the nation. So, for roughly 600 more dollars, Cornell students have access to unlimited meals and substantially better quality dining.\u00a0\n\t\t\t\tSEE MORE FROM ERIC NAJERA: \ufeffWe should be grateful to attend PennPenn clubs should have an assigned faculty member\ufeffAside from price and quality, weekend dining is another struggle. With the popular McClelland Sushi & Market and Houston Market being closed on Saturdays and the other dining halls closing at 8 p.m., food options are limited. Late-night study sessions means having to resort to local food places that remain open, and unlike nearby schools such as Drexel, our dining dollars do not work at off-campus restaurants and out-of-pocket money spent on takeout can add up quickly.\nBefore every school break, Sidechat is flooded with posts of excitement for home-cooked meals. In my classes, when asked what we are excited for, most students reply being able to eat good food. It is not uncommon for college students to miss their home-cooked meals, but when students are excited to actually eat food that is not served alongside insects, it signifies a problem.\n\tWith Penn\u2019s Bon App\u00e9tit contract still in place, we may not know how much Penn can do to change the dining experience. Safe, clean food should not be an unreasonable expectation. In order to enhance a student's experience outside the classroom, Penn must budget for an edible food experience for all students.\nERIC NAJERA is a College sophomore studying history from Rolling Meadows, Ill.

          "title": "Zaid Alsubaiei | Does Penn\u2019s diversity represent its sense of community?",
          "article_content": "We all know the typical \u201ctypes\u201d of high schoolers, the different clich\u00e9s: Where are my nerds at? But, another attribute of student groups that has become increasingly relevant in the 21st century United States is the diverse ethnic makeup of its population. And, frankly, do we as a campus mirror all that comes with that national trend of diversity?\nThink of the friends with whom you often hang out. Then, ask those friends with whom they usually go out. Finally, think of the groups you are a part of, the extracurriculars in which you partake. Notice a pattern?\n\t\t\u201c[D]espite increased opportunity to live and work in mixed-race settings, Americans remain racially segregated in their friendship patterns,\u201d a study published by the National Institutes of Health found. \u201cSpatial racism, cultural encapsulation, and personal choice are contributing factors for patterns of same-race friendships.\u201d\u00a0\nThis pattern seems to reflect the divisions present in Penn\u2019s social scene as well. Despite coming from all sorts of backgrounds across the world, the University\u2019s students appear to have unconsciously adopted a policy of self segregation. In other words, we like to \u201cstick to our own\u201d by socializing with others to whom we relate to on a cultural, ethnic, or religious basis. So, regardless of Penn\u2019s efforts to integrate people of differing experiences and beliefs, there still remains a degree of resistance by individuals themselves to cross those racial or cultural lines.\n\t\t\n\t\nAs a result, the potential for diversity of thought is threatened. A narrow mindset develops within these groups that students pledge to, and they effectively act as echo chambers that exacerbate already crippling political polarization. We relate to each other less, rely on our \u201cown\u201d more, and become less tolerant of the views, and thus experiences, of those who do not necessarily look, think, or speak like us.\nThis kind of thinking \u2014 whether manifested in the form of race, religion, or otherwise \u2014 has led to serious tension at times and enabled a distorted view of certain communities and how they experience Penn. I attribute part of that thinking not to the identity groups we are a part of, but to how much we value them over who we are as individuals.\n\tHomogenous communities definitely have their place in the college experience: They help ease our transition when we first arrive at Penn, and their role cannot be replaced. I say this as an international student myself, who had a hard time acclimating to an entirely different culture and, most radically, diet. Nonetheless, we should treat these organizations as an aid to finding belonging on campus, not a substitute for individual thought and expression.\nHowever, none of this means individuals can\u2019t agree or always need to separate themselves from the group. The use of a large, collective voice can benefit our campus much more than we realize. What is important to note is that there lies a clear distinction between acknowledging the views of others and forcing ourselves to accept those views for the sake of conformity.\nThere is nothing wrong with disagreeing with the majority, whether it is one against two or one against a nation (though some may try to tell you otherwise). As long as you are respectful and driven by a desire to learn rather than defend, there are no limits on what perspective you may question. So, challenge your beliefs, reevaluate your viewpoint, challenge that of others (no matter who they are), and then reevaluate yourself again. It\u2019ll be hard at first, to express your precise, genuine thoughts without fear. But, remember that you\u2019re not alone (I struggle sometimes myself) and that it\u2019s a process you won\u2019t always get right.\n\t\tGet our newsletter, DP Daybreak, delivered to your inbox every weekday morning.The hardest part of breaking out of groupthink, after realizing it, is talking about it. My advice? Take the plunge and never look back. The next time you are in a group and the majority agrees with an idea you don\u2019t like, let it be known. Talk about it and explain why you think the way you do. Don\u2019t worry if some get offended or others simply do not agree; it is normal and, in fact, expected.\u00a0\nNever forget that disputes you engage in are an opportunity, not a challenge, and our differences are enlightening, not threatening. Only then will we begin to understand and appreciate each other more as unique actors in a truly historic community.\nZAID ALSUBAIEI is a College first year studying economics from Al-Khobar, Saudi Arabia.

          "title": "Eliza Carroll | You are what you read: Sidechat\u2019s impact on campus",
          "article_content": "I downloaded Sidechat this fall after my friends sent me too many screenshots of funny memes or jokes posted on the anonymous app. I figured that doing so would simply remove the middleman. I was already being exposed to the same jokes, memes, comments and judgements as those on the app anyway \u2026 right?\u00a0\nIn December, I returned home for reading days and fell into an easy pattern of studying. Nothing I did was wildly exciting or social, but I instead found myself enjoying the routine and satisfaction of productivity. During my study breaks, I would scroll on Sidechat \u2014 and from the comfort of my home, I felt myself spiraling into anxious dread about returning to Penn. Each time I opened the app, I was faced with a barrage of posts all echoing the same sentiment: Penn is awful and depressing. Without a second thought, I accepted those posts as fact, and in doing so, I allowed Sidechat to have more power than it deserves. In other words, I subscribed to the complaining culture that is pervasive on Sidechat.\u00a0\n\t\tUsing Sidechat, especially without intentional thought, is a way of looking at Penn through hypercritical glasses. Perhaps this is because negativity has been normalized and cynicism gets more upvotes. To some extent, this pessimistic messaging is diluted with the insertion of mildly entertaining memes or jokes, but the result is still the same. With each scroll, Sidechat is perpetuating a defeatist perspective of Penn.\u00a0\nSo, I arrived back at Penn to take my final exam: openly unhappy about returning to what I thought would be a bleak campus as a result of discourse on Sidechat. But to my surprise, it was not horrific, and I was able to enjoy my weekend of studying just as I had my week at home. The sheer volume of disheartening posts on Sidechat had clouded my perspective and ability to see the best in the situation. Sure, I was becoming one with a Huntsman GSR while others were at home enjoying break, but on the other hand, I was with my friends and able to have a sleepy campus all to myself.\n\t\t\t\tAs is the case with most other social media platforms, Sidechat is consumed passively and without a second thought \u2014 it\u2019s used to pass time, curb boredom, and satiate our addictions to our phones. And yet, students are absorbing and internalizing content more quickly than they can truly digest it.\u00a0\nGiven the bandwagon culture on Sidechat, users often build off of one another, creating a chaotic, and often dismal, echo chamber that does not truly represent life at Penn. Whether or not college is the best four years of your life, it is at least what you make of it, and Sidechat enables students to feel like victims of an unknown cause. For those who are actually struggling, Sidechat acts not as a productive outlet, but rather as a meta ether that provides no remedy other than the satisfaction that others are unhappy too.\u00a0\n\tSince winter break, I have in fact deleted Sidechat and am all the better for it. I still get sent the best and the brightest jokes by my friends, but I am no longer overwhelmed by unsolicited complaints on an hourly basis. Without Sidechat, my thoughts on the housing lottery, the floods in the Quad, and upcoming midterms are completely my own. Deleting Sidechat may not be for everyone, but it\u2019s imperative for those who chose to use Sidechat to take a more critical view of what is being circulated and evaluate whether or not they are benefiting from it. It may just change the way they see Penn.\u00a0\nELIZA CARROLL is a College first year studying international relations and art history from Greenwich, Conn.

          "title": "Cathy Li and Liala Sofi | History can\u2019t repeat itself; stand with Chinatown",
          "article_content": "Students for the Preservation of Chinatown protested outside the Board of Trustees meeting held at the Inn at Penn on Mar. 3, 2023. \nA few weeks ago, the streets of Chinatown came to life with firecrackers and lion dances ringing in the year of the dragon. As you walk through the brightly colored 40-foot paifang \u2014 known to most as Chinatown\u2019s Friendship Gate \u2014 you enter into a cultural oasis that has stood strong in the heart of Philadelphia for nearly 150 years. Beyond this fixture, Chinatown serves as a home to nearly 3,000 residents and numerous family-owned businesses, restaurants, shops, and community organizations. Whether you are going to Ken\u2019s Seafood Restaurant for a fun night out or Heng Fa for groceries, Chinatown feels like home.\u00a0\nUnfortunately, this community has been under constant attack for decades and is once again facing the threat of displacement and gentrification from a plan to develop an arena for the Philadelphia 76ers merely a block away. We firmly stand with the Students for the Preservation of Chinatown and urge you to do the same. \u00a0\n\t\tSince the early 1900s, Chinatown has been a victim of gentrification often driven by predatory infrastructure projects. In 1932, the construction of subway infrastructure at Ridge and Eighth streets \u2014 and the subsequent development of the Vine Street Expressway from 1957 to 1991 \u2014 resulted in the destruction of buildings and severe divisions within the community. Bringing in noise and pollution, the expressway eroded neighborhoods and people's quality of life. This was not Chinatown's sole battle, however, as it also faced multiple proposals of developments for a federal prison in 1992, a baseball stadium in 2000, and a casino in 2008.\u00a0\nThe story of Philadelphia's Chinatown mirrors other Chinatowns across the nation. Amid the 1994 fiscal crisis in Washington, D.C., then-Washington Wizards owner Abe Pollin negotiated a deal for the downtown Capital One Arena, where the city covered pre-development costs to acquire and demolish properties. Entrepreneurs in Washington's Chinatown voiced concerns about prices of real estate skyrocketing and parking impacts on businesses in the area. A decade later, most Chinese residents were forced to move out due to unaffordable housing. The parking shortage led to the closure of the last Chinese grocery store, accelerating the decline of the Chinese American population in the area to fewer than 400 residents today. Ironically, as D.C.\u2019s arena now relocates to the suburbs, the community is left behind, having endured irreversible destruction while in the midst of its recovery from the pandemic.\u00a0\n\t\t\t\tMORE FROM LIALA SOFI AND CATHY LI:Liala Sofi | The hypocrisy of billionaire philanthropistsCathy Li | Philadelphia\u2019s changing tastesIn New York\u2019s Chinatown, threats of displacement and economic insecurity also loom high. In 2021, the Museum of Chinese in America accepted a donation of $35 million in support of a borough-based jail complex which would displace Chinese American working-class people in the area. On top of that, its board executives were connected to the closing of the last unionized restaurant, beloved Jing Fong banquet hall, and construction of luxury towers that are actively raising rent and real estate taxes in the area.\nIn Philadelphia, the current 76Place project is being developed by 76 DevCo, an initiative by 76ers managing partners Josh Harris, David Blitzer, and David Adelman. Adelman is at the forefront of the construction of the arena and has promised not to displace the residents or businesses in Chinatown, but his past actions speak louder than his current words. Adelman works closely with Brett Altman, who also owns the University City Townhomes, and was a key figure behind the demolition and end of affordable housing in the West Philadelphia area that was previously known as the \"Black Bottom.\u201d This constant cycle of displacing residents and communities that have lived in the area for generations must end, and we must be the voice to make this happen.\n\tDevelopers of the project have stated that the arena will \u201cserve as a model for an equitable & inclusive community,\u201d yet there is not a single mention of Chinatown in the proposal. Efforts to ensure communities can benefit from this project read as empty promises when nearly 95% of residents, business owners, and visitors oppose the arena\u2019s construction.\nMany questions posed by residents have also gone unanswered by 76 DevCo. How will restaurants and small businesses in the surrounding area be protected? Who will clean the streets after huge events?\u00a0\nPreserving Philadelphia's architectural heritage demands careful consideration in urban development, but the development of the arena does the exact opposite \u2014 jeopardizing accessible low-income and senior housing complexes, healthcare clinics, and schools for children.\nPenn has direct ties to the developers in the area, and students should be cognizant of the situation. Adelman currently sits on Penn Medicine Board of Trustees and is the CEO of Campus Apartments, which houses many Penn students off-campus. But more importantly, Penn students are directly and indirectly involved in the Chinatown community, whether that be Penn Lions performing all throughout the city for Lunar New Year, or student groups like SPOC organizing initiatives to honor traditions celebrating the multi-ethnic communities that reside there.\u00a0\nDespite what greedy developers may suggest, Chinatown is not an ethnic theme park but a home. It\u2019s more than just a place to eat, it\u2019s a support network and a cultural hub for immigrants and visitors alike.\nIn the face of ongoing threats, Chinatown has demonstrated remarkable resilience and activism, advocating for the needs of all diverse communities of color that are integrated into the cultural fabric of our city. The next time you are in Chinatown, take a look around at all the place has to offer. Venture into Ebisu for some home decor and enjoy a Mochinut donut as you shop. Come by Dae Bak for soul-nourishing Korean barbecue. The opportunities to support your favorite restaurants and local businesses are endless.\nPlease don't turn a blind eye to what is happening outside the Penn bubble. Pay attention to what SPOC and other organizers are doing in the fight for the preservation of Chinatown. Educate yourself on what is going on in Chinatowns across the country. If you can, participate in programming like Crane Chinatown Community Center art exhibitions or Show Your Love for Chinatown events to learn more about the challenges facing the neighborhood. Sign petitions. \u00a0\nAdorned with dragon motifs, and gorgeous ornamental roof tiles, the Friendship Archway is not only an architectural masterpiece, but a labor of love \u2014\u00a0created for community by community. The engineers and artisans from Tianjin, China \u2014 Philadelphia\u2019s sister city \u2014 came together with residents and the city of Philadelphia to fund and invest in Chinatown, and you should too.\u00a0\nThe next time you walk through the gate, remember that the fight for Philadelphia\u2019s Chinatown, and Chinatowns everywhere, is not over.

          "title": "Caroline Magdolen | \u201cEveryone cheats.\u201d What can we do about it?",
          "article_content": "My guess is that nearly everyone reading this article knows someone who has been academically disingenuous, or been that someone before. Being academically dishonest isn\u2019t all about flashy examples, like the two admitted Penn students accused of plagiarism and fabricating data in 2022. There are smaller violations that may feel less egregious, or even harmless, like querying ChatGPT for help completing your homework, peeking at a friend\u2019s lab assignment, or answering a PollEverywhere as if you\u2019re in class, when really, you\u2019re snoozing in your dorm.\nAcademic dishonesty is having a moment in the spotlight. The advent of generative AI, the use of which cannot be reliably detected by grading softwares, will likely upend student learning for better or worse. At the same time, examples of plagiarism by prominent academics are being dug up left and right. The former president of Harvard, Claudine Gay, was ousted in part due to plagiarism concerns, and Business Insider found that former MIT professor Neri Oxman (the wife of billionaire Bill Ackman, who led the campaign against Gay) \u201cstole sentences and whole paragraphs from Wikipedia, other scholars and technical documents in her academic writing.\u201d\n\t\tTo be clear, I believe that academic dishonesty at Penn \u2014 going against community standards that your professor has explicitly outlined \u2014 is unacceptable, and that we should be doing more to penalize and prevent it.\nNevertheless, we must also acknowledge that academic dishonesty is understandable, in that we can piece together students\u2019 rationales when they do cheat, and even sympathize with them in some cases.\n\t\t\t\tSEE MORE FROM CAROLINE MAGDOLEN:\ufeffThe Rat Kings of PennThere\u2019s no better time for climate education\ufeffTo dissuade academic dishonesty, we employ sayings like, \u201cIt will only hurt you in the long run to cheat,\u201d or \u201cYou\u2019re taking advantage of other students who've completed their work fairly.\u201d This is true in some circumstances. If you\u2019re an aspiring quant and you\u2019re asking ChatGPT to calculate all of the derivatives on your MATH 1400 homework, it\u2019s going to show: First in your exams for the class, then in every math class you take thereafter, and especially in your future career. And if MATH 1400 is curved, your dishonest success capitalizes on the honest failures of others \u2014 not cool.\nBut this is not true in all cases. Jane* was a first year in her spring term when she was taking CIS 1210: Data Structures and Algorithms \u2014 a famously challenging CIS course \u2014 with Rajiv Gandhi, a famously challenging professor.\u00a0\n\tShe cheated on her coding assignment late into the semester, and as per the professor\u2019s policy, received a -300/100 on the submitted homework and zeros on all previously submitted homework, receiving a D as her final grade in the course.\nBut Jane believes that what is more important to her story is not what happened, but why it happened.\u00a0\n\u201cWhat drove me to make a bad decision? Why are [these classes] so infamous? It\u2019s because of notorious policies where you cannot collaborate on many assignments. You are given long problem sets to do, on your own, each week, with desperate students in office hour queues that are two to four hours long. Many times, you will go to the TA and not get a clear answer. It is a profoundly isolating situation, particularly for freshmen just entering college, and that\u2019s what drives well-meaning people to cheat.\u201d\nBased on my conversation with Jane, it seemed that she felt isolated at the time and was struggling to reach out for the support that she needed, both in CIS 1210 and at Penn as a whole. And given the limited support Jane could receive from TAs and her instructor, backtracking her friend\u2019s code felt more conducive to her learning than doing nothing.\nJane expressed a lot of remorse over what happened, and said that she still has a lot of respect for Rajiv, maintaining a good relationship with him to this day. She was also grateful that Rajiv was willing to handle this internally, since a low grade in the class looks better than a formal statement on her transcript, detailing her violation of academic integrity.\n\u201cI deserved to be punished harshly,\u201d Jane said. \u201cBut the collaboration policies of these introductory courses, and the punishment I received, wrecked my self-esteem and my early college experience. I felt that there was no way out.\u201d\nAccording to Jane, Rajiv's philosophy is to \"let go of your grades early: the sooner you stop caring about your GPA and start caring about learning, the better.\" She agrees with this philosophy, especially since he curves his courses generously, but sees this as out of touch with the realities of many Penn students.\nAfter students have prioritized perfecting their grades and resumes (and have been praised for it) in high school, those habits won\u2019t get undone overnight. Even at Penn, there are many institutions and accolades that continue to reward \u201cperfect\u201d performance over pursuing difficult academic disciplines, experimenting, and invariably messing up sometimes.\nFrankly, for a pre-med student in computer science (a track which Jane was considering at the time), the adage that \u201ccheating will hurt you in the long run\u201d skill-wise doesn\u2019t hold much water. The skillset of a future doctor and a software engineer just don\u2019t overlap enough. What can hurt a pre-med in the long run is a low GPA.\nAnd while there are some students for whom projects, internships, and technical interviews will get them a lot further in guaranteeing their success, this is not true for everyone. For many preprofessional students who may want to challenge themselves with a major or minor in CIS, they risk getting shut out of the study altogether.\nWhat frustrates me most about this entire situation is not that such harsh action was taken, but that it appears ineffective in tackling the issue at hand. If a student wanted to cheat, they could just take CIS 1600 or CIS 1210 during a different semester, when a different instructor was in charge and penalties were anecdotally known for being less harsh.\nWhile Jane\u2019s actions were clearly wrong, I can\u2019t help thinking that she was just the unlucky example that had to face the music, and she said as much in our interview: \u201cEveryone cheats in this class. You don\u2019t survive [CIS 1600 or CIS 1210] without talking to people, it just depends on whether you get caught. That doesn\u2019t make cheating okay, but it does mean that we need to rethink how these courses operate.\u201d\nSo, what can we do so that not everyone cheats?\nThis is a complex question, and there is no easy answer. It is crucial that as we frame the issue of academic integrity violations, we look at both the violations themselves and the root motivations that drive them \u2014 these actions are not taking place in a vacuum.\u00a0\nAcademic integrity violations these days are, to an extent, simply easier to commit. ChatGPT has led to a surge in \u201cunfair advantage\u201d violations. And even before generative AI, the pandemic had uprooted our usual test-taking environment. Now that classes are in person again, we no longer need to have take-home or open-Internet exams, but these still persist in some classes, and are easier to cheat on. Penn, given its history of fraudulent alumni, isn\u2019t going to be a place where professors can blindly trust students to refrain from cheating when presented with the option, so professors should take some responsibility for leveling the playing field in the classroom too.\u00a0\nJulie Nettleton, the executive director of Penn\u2019s Center for Community Standards and Accountability (CSA), relayed over email that CSA already works closely with schools and centralized resources at Penn to discuss how to proctor exams, and with faculty to discuss exams, syllabi language, and classroom policies.\nWhat constitutes a violation itself is currently not standard across classes, or even across different sections of the same class. How to handle a concern of academic integrity falls to the professor first \u2014 this is how Jane completed CIS 1210 with a lower grade, rather than a formal sanction from the CSA. It makes sense to delegate this responsibility to professors: It is more efficient than having the CSA handle every case, and professors should have the freedom to decide what constitutes cheating in their classrooms.\nHowever, this does open the door to students deliberately choosing sections of a course with professors that have more relaxed academic integrity policies. Conversely, some professors can be overly harsh, to the point where they are acting unfairly towards their students.\u00a0\nJill*, another student that I interviewed for this article, was falsely accused by her professor of collaborating on her final exam with her peers. At the start of winter break, the professor sent a class-wide email imploring those who worked together on the take-home exam to turn themselves in or have the matter escalated. Jill recalls that for students that turned themselves in, the professor lowered their grades accordingly \u2014 everyone else was reported to the CSA.\nIn the end, Jill\u2019s name was cleared, but she was assigned a case manager that seemed to have assumed she was guilty by default. As the case progressed, many of the details that the professor used to build the case against her appeared superfluous \u2014 for example, she and her friends had all rounded to the same decimal place in their work. Jill suspects that the escalation may have been personal: she had previously asked the professor, on behalf of the class, if he could make changes to his teaching style to facilitate learning.\nIt seems wrong to me that a professor could accuse a student and cause such extensive stress when in the end, Jill turned out to be innocent. It reminded me of some other methods that professors use to catch students cheating, such as Turnitin\u2019s flawed AI detector.\nPart of the solution to rampant academic dishonesty may also lie in expanding our vocabulary to discuss the issue, as John McWhorter pointed out in The New York Times. A class-wide cheating ring, direct plagiarism of original ideas from a paper as one\u2019s own, and copying a line of someone\u2019s code all constitute academic dishonesty, but range broadly in terms of severity and \u201cease of catching.\u201d However, this is rarely reflected in academic integrity policies.\u00a0\nIt can be awkward to suggest that some forms of dishonesty are worse than others, and more awkward still to draw the line between different punishments for different violations, but we must still have these conversations.\u00a0\nWhat should constitute dishonesty at all? When speaking with Jane, she would often circle back to how isolating it was to work alone on her assignments as a first year in introductory computer science courses, particularly as a woman in STEM. Every day, she would walk out of class \u201cfeeling way worse about [her]self.\u201d Now exploring chemistry, physics, and biology courses, she greatly appreciates the change in her academic environment, where students are encouraged to openly collaborate. The grade medians in chemistry are similar to those in CIS (which is to say, not great), but Jane is not as stressed as she was in CIS 1210, since she studies with her friends, and they can struggle and ask for help together.\u00a0\nWhile it was dishonest of Jane to copy code when it was against CIS 1210 policy, perhaps CIS majors and minors would learn more from the course if they were in a more collaborative environment to begin with. Jane has suggested that CIS 1210 should find a middle ground where students can learn from each other, but not be overly reliant on collaboration to perform well on exams.\u00a0\nShe also argues that there should be more opportunities for students to admit to academic dishonesty \u2014 through a friend at Stanford, she heard that at the end of a computer science class, students can select the assignments they have cheated on and receive a negative score on them, or risk facing more uncertain penalties if they are later caught.\u00a0\n\u201cThis policy gives people a second chance to do the right thing, and I do believe that you learn from an experience if you own up to it,\u201d Jane said.\nDeliberations over how best to address academic dishonesty can go on without end, but unfortunately this column must do just that. So here, I want to leave you with a reminder of what I said at the beginning: Academic dishonesty is unacceptable, but it is also understandable.\n\t\tGet our newsletter, DP Daybreak, delivered to your inbox every weekday morning.The hard, but necessary, solution to \u201ceveryone cheating\u201d is taking a good look at the stories behind academic dishonesty, and listening to the students involved with sympathy.

          "title": "Jack Lakis | What we can learn from Penn\u2019s college ranking",
          "article_content": "Last fall, a plethora of new results from U.S. News & World Report, Wall Street Journal, and Forbes elevated Penn in their national college rankings. Nearly every list places Penn among the top 10, some going as far as placing the University among the top five. This universal growth resulted from a key change in most of these sources\u2019 metrics: greater consideration given to postgraduate salaries.\nPenn famously has one of the highest-earning alumni bodies in the country. Starting salaries for Penn graduates are often considered the highest in the Ivy League. By mid-career, the average Penn alum is raking in $165,000 annually, while the national average for a college graduate caps out at $74,000.\n\t\tPenn draws a great deal of prestige from its potential to produce high earners, which is a direct result of our school\u2019s preprofessional culture. Nearly 50% of all Penn graduates enter one of two career fields: consulting or finance. This pipeline allows most Penn alumni to matriculate into high-paying jobs shortly after graduation.\nI\u2019m usually a defender of preprofessionalism. It\u2019s crucial that Penn graduates are able to find good jobs, and high salary potential is an immense advantage. But those jobs aren\u2019t everything. Many universities are making gains in rankings and name recognition based on alumni outcomes in public service careers.\n\t\t\t\t\ufeffSEE MORE FROM JACK LAKIS:\ufeffDo we all hate Penn?Staying focused after Magill's resignation\ufeffFor example, Harvard University boasts about its eight presidential alumni. However, when 1968 Wharton graduate Donald Trump was elected president, Penn mostly ignored his history with the school. Given his proximity to controversy and his unconventional political history, Penn\u2019s bump in prestige was limited by Trump\u2019s election. Our second closest claim to the White House is the University\u2019s relationship with President Joe Biden and the opening of the Penn Biden Center. I argue that this is as far as Penn\u2019s ties to the presidency will go. Nowadays, Penn\u2019s laser focus on professional development might repel students who will one day have presidential potential.\nComparable institutions to Penn have high-earning graduates and prestigious placements throughout the government, nonprofit sector, and the advocacy space. For example, Georgetown University feeds graduates into congressional offices and many Fulbright programs. Princeton University also regularly features its flashy roster of graduates in powerful political offices. These universities maintain a strong presence in the private sector but are also actively represented in government positions.\n\tIn these examples, the institution itself sponsors an undergraduate school dedicated to public service. At Georgetown, it\u2019s the School of Foreign Service, while at Princeton the role is filled by the School of Public and International Affairs.\nI propose that Penn follow suit and create a fifth undergraduate school dedicated to public affairs. This new school could absorb Penn\u2019s wildly popular social science programs, like PPE (Philosophy, Politics and Economics), Political Science, and Economics. Currently, most students in these majors are scooped up by consulting firms and investment banks. If these students were given an intentional focus on service and social responsibility, perhaps they could feel empowered to use their degrees in a more meaningful way.\nThe least Penn can do is expand its current effort to bridge the gap between social science degree seekers and careers in government and nonprofits. It\u2019s crucial that our student body actively engages with the robust policy infrastructure that Penn has already made available: Civic House, Perry World House, opportunities like Penn in Washington, and extracurricular engagements offered by the Government and Politics Association. From what I\u2019ve seen, these resources are underutilized at Penn. By snubbing them, Penn students are working against the general interests of the University to gain prestige.\n\t\tGet our newsletter, DP Daybreak, delivered to your inbox every weekday morning.Besides, it's about more than just rankings. We have the potential to empower our students to become leaders in society. TIME Magazine ranks Penn as the third-best college for aspiring leaders. However, the article states its rationale for this placement as a concentration of graduates in business careers. Other chart-topping schools on this list were noted for their programs in law, medicine, and more.\nUltimately, private sector homogeneity marks one of Penn\u2019s key weaknesses. As we move forward, Penn has a duty to educate leaders in more than one field. If Penn strengthened its programs in civic engagement, more graduates would be inclined to pursue roles in government and could elevate Penn\u2019s cultural stature. We should be known for more than salaries. We can do more than business.\nJACK LAKIS is a College first year studying political science from Kennesaw, Ga.

          "title": "Mia Vesely | Black Penn is vibrant this month and every month",
          "article_content": "As of late, most of my columns have focused on things I take issue with: Whether it\u2019s Liz Magill\u2019s resignation and the threats to free speech on campus, or the lack of racial diversity in Panhellenic sororities. I haven't highlighted the things that I truly appreciate and, more specifically, the places in which I\u2019ve found community at Penn.\nLast February, I argued that Black history is important for everyone. Education surrounding Black people, their lives, and their contributions should be integrated into the standard curriculum. Black Penn shows up and shows out every month, but this month in particular, there are many events and ways that Penn student organizations uplift the community and come together.\u00a0\n\t\tIt would be impossible to touch on all of these amazing events and their impacts, but I\u2019d like to paint a picture of some of these groups and their initiatives during this month and beyond. Planning for these events takes months. For example, when Descendants of Afro-Americans at Penn (DAAP) \u2014 a club founded just last year \u2014 put on their first-ever gala on Feb. 1 to kick off the month, you better believe that the event was well-planned and executed.\u00a0\nThe gala \u2014 Red Carpet For A Cause \u2014 supported the Sickle Cell Disease Association of America's Philadelphia and Delaware Valley Chapter. The night included catered food, live performances from student groups like The Inspiration, wonderful community, and beautiful decor\u2014even including an ice sculpture of the DAAP logo. Over $1,700 was raised in support of the foundation.\n\t\t\t\tSEE MORE FROM MIA VESELY:\ufeffI dropped sorority rush and I\u2019m gladFirst Liz Magill, next free speechWhen asked about the impacts of the event, College sophomore and DAAP founding member Clarke Dickens said, \u201cWe wanted to bring the community together for a great cause, especially a cause that affects a lot of African Americans and Black people more broadly.\u201d\nSickle cell disease occurs in about one in every 365 Black babies born in the United States. The percentage of Black people who carry the trait is even higher, with one in 13 Black babies being born as carriers.\n\tDickens is not just involved with DAAP, but is also on the boards for QBlack and Shea Collective.\nThese clubs are all part of something commonly dubbed \u201cBlack Penn,\u201d which focuses on so many different aspects of identity. From cultural organizations like Penn African Student Association (PASA), to preprofessional organizations like Black Wharton and the Black Pre-Law Association (BPLA), to community service organizations like the NAACP, all of these organizations put an emphasis on service both inside the Penn community and out.\u00a0\nFor example, Campus Curlz \u2014 a club I serve on the board of \u2014 is, at first glance, a club centered around uplifting natural hair and embracing positivity. \u00a0But underlying hair mask making events and movie nights, there is a strong commitment to service. Just this month, the community service committee held an event where we made Valentine\u2019s Day cards for senior citizens at Mercy Life West Philadelphia.\nService by board members is a requirement to be part of funding organizations like UMOJA \u2014 the umbrella funding organization for Black clubs \u2014 and even beyond that, many clubs center service in every activity they partake in. Whether you\u2019re on the board of a club or not, there are many service opportunities available and encouraged.\nWhen asked what they wish people knew about Black Penn, Dickens said, \u201cClubs should make an effort to include grad students, it makes all the difference. I\u2019m able to say, \u2018This is what I would look like coming here for grad school,\u2019 and it can even offer opportunities for mentorship.\u201d\nWhat seems to drive Black Penn is first and foremost the students, then the supportive and involved faculty, as well as the local partnerships and opportunities the clubs find, build, and pursue for themselves. Many members of the DAAP board are native to Philadelphia, so that makes their work even more personal.\nWhile Black students do take initiative to realize what they need and create the spaces they want to see, there is so much room for improvement on behalf of Penn: whether it\u2019s stratifying the way funding is given to these clubs \u2014 they often can\u2019t fund silverware in UMOJA meetings if it can be provided elsewhere \u2014 or improving the cultural spaces available to students (we were promised the ARCH \u2018building,\u2019 not the ARCH \u2018basement\u2019). In months like February, Penn aims to spotlight their Black students. I just wish this recognition of the incredible community Black students forged for themselves, when they initially didn\u2019t see it on campus, came year-round.\n\t\tGet our newsletter, DP Daybreak, delivered to your inbox every weekday morning.Events like DAAP's gala happen every month, and it\u2019s important not to understate the role these organizations play in making Penn a welcoming and accepting place for students from marginalized backgrounds.\nI was happy to see Faces of Black Penn \u2014 a Black-run publication \u2014 highlighted in the DP last week. I hope people continue to uplift the work of these student groups going forward and make space to give all students their roses. Black History Month is not over, and the time to appreciate Black students and their work does not end come March.\nMIA VESELY is a College sophomore studying philosophy, politics, and economics from Phoenix, A.Z.

          "title": "Bernadine Kumi | I joined a sorority and I\u2019m glad",
          "article_content": "I\u2019ll be honest: I was not a fan of Greek life when I first got to Penn. My perception of Greek life was influenced by growing up in the South, mainly in suburban Georgia. This included a sorority scene of girls with fake spray tans and little to no personality. The images of sorority girls from the University of Georgia and Alabama screamed no diversity, which made me wary of joining a sorority at Penn. Being a First-Generation, Low-Income (FGLI) student made me especially hesitant. Even more so, coming from a Ghanaian household, the notion of a sorority was immediately dismissed as something against our Christian values. Thus, during my first year, I knew I would never, and I mean never, join a sorority.\u00a0\nHowever, by the beginning of sophomore year, my mindset began to change. After a year on campus, I had found a solid community of a small group of friends. But beyond that, I felt that I did not really know anyone. I couldn\u2019t name more than 20 people in my grade. Penn is known for being a networking school, and the \u201cSocial Ivy,\u201d so I began to question just how much I had taken advantage of that. That, along with most of the underclassmen party scene revolving around fraternities, made the idea of rushing even more appealing.\u00a0\n\t\tSo while most people were beginning their sophomore year with the friends they already had, I began to look for additional friends. My twin sister, who also goes to Penn, and I began attending open rush events, talking to sophomores in sororities, and involving ourselves in more social events. Over the next few months, my days consisted of talking to many girls, going to dinners, and putting myself out there in a way that I had been hesitant to do before. I made new friends, met fellow sophomores also in search of a bigger community, and found myself loving the idea of joining a sorority.\u00a0\nBut what made me even more eager was just how inclusive and diverse sororities were at Penn, more so than I had been expecting\u2014especially the off-campus sorority I ended up joining, OAX. I was still wary about rushing, but as soon as I got to the first event, I immediately felt comfortable. There were girls with different interests, passions, economic backgrounds, and personalities. Not a single conversation felt forced. Every girl I met had a unique and authentic story, and I felt like I could talk to them for hours.\n\t\t\t\tSEE MORE FROM BERNADINE KUMI:\ufeffDining hall workers at Penn Hillel demand better treatment from UniversityI was especially captivated by BLOAX (Black OAX), a community within OAX that includes fellow girls of Ghanaian descent and other Black girls who provided me with guidance on navigating Penn as a Black woman. OAX also has other smaller communities, such as LatinOAX and RainbOAX. Being able to find other people with similar backgrounds made the choice to join a sorority that much easier.\u00a0\nAs a FGLI student and Questbridge scholar, the idea of paying high dues out of my minimal work paychecks every month was unfathomable. I knew that joining a sorority would pose another financial burden, and even though I was loving the OAX community, the idea of paying dues scared me. Yet once again, OAX and other sororities surprised me with their understanding and financial transparency. They worked with me to develop an affordable monthly payment plan so that I, like every other girl interested in rushing, could also enjoy being in a sorority.\u00a0\n\tSince the morning of Bid Day when I got \u201cthe call,\u201d I know that I truly made the right decision by joining a sorority, for not only my social life but my professional life too. This past fall, I was able to land a summer internship in Los Angeles with the help of my grand-big. I was also able to prepare for my interview with girls in my sorority, who gave me the confidence I needed to land the opportunity. As a Black woman and FGLI student, I have truly benefited from joining Greek life. I hope students who are hesitant to rush, just as I once was, will see my experience and how transformative it can be. I hope others \u2014 whether they are Black women, FGLI students, or just Penn students in search of a greater community \u2014 can do the same.\nBERNADINE KUMI is a College junior studying political science and legal studies and history from Roswell, Ga.

          "article_content": "Columnist Jessey Shin explores the problem of disparate advising quality in the College and argues \nfor a more standardized experience.\u201cMy advisor lied to me?\u201d\nI remember someone saying this to me in complete disbelief, but I can\u2019t say I\u2019m surprised. Advisors can be as misleading as they are helpful, and this is a widespread problem that needs addressing.\n\t\tIn the College, students typically have between 15 and 20 credits outside of their primary major to meet the graduation requirement. These are used to fulfill general education requirements, pursue a second major or minor, or take elective courses that align with a student\u2019s interests.\nThe freedom to pursue one\u2019s intellectual pursuits is, of course, one of the draws of the College. I am looking to pursue two majors myself, in somewhat interconnected but disparate fields of study: the flexibility offered by the curriculum allows me to explore these interests without taking an obscene number of classes.\n\t\t\t\tSEE MORE FROM JESSEY SHIN:Making a case for the less popular college housesNavigating the maze of Penn's resources\ufeffThe problem is few students go into their first year knowing which major they would like to pursue, much less exactly which courses to take.\u00a0\nThe College puts a lot of effort into informing incoming students about the curriculum and what they have to offer, such as through the Compass module on Canvas that gives a foray into some aspects of the College experience (something that other schools do not offer). However, the sheer number of options can be overwhelming, giving rise to a unique need for personalized, one-on-one guidance. This is where pre-major advisors come in.\u00a0\n\tPre-major advisors, assigned to each student before they start their first semester at Penn, are a vital resource for College students. They guide students through the course selection process, encouraging and helping them as they explore their various interests and eventually settle on a major.\nI can say that I have had a relatively good experience with my pre-major advisor. However, I also found that some of the advice offered was not fully applicable to my circumstance, because of the recent transition from Penn InTouch to Path@Penn.\nOther students, however, are not as lucky. I have heard stories about advisors making their students cry, spreading misinformation, jeopardizing their advisees\u2019 course registration, you name it.\nIn an interview, one student (who requested anonymity) shared that they have had trouble reaching their pre-major advisor from the get-go. College students must meet with their advisor one-on-one to get their course registration hold lifted; without this, they are not eligible to participate in advance registration. The student was only able to reach their advisor a day or so before the deadline and has continued to have trouble with availability.\nOf course, their pre-major advisor experience was less than ideal. \u201cHer guidance wasn\u2019t so much guidance as it was looking at the boxes and seeing if I checked them,\u201d they said. \u201cI don\u2019t think I would feel comfortable going to her for personal issues, such as which major to pursue or how to explore [some of my interests], because I don\u2019t think she would point me [in] the right direction.\u201d Instead, they had been utilizing their PennCAP advisor (available for FGLI students) for these concerns.\nOn the other hand, some students are able to form a positive relationship with their advisor and find that they are helpful in navigating their interests. Rishi Dadlani, a College first year, described his advisor as \u201cfriendly and helpful. He gave me his phone number and told me to contact him if I [had] any questions \u2026 If I saw him around campus, I would say hi, and he always sends us a beginning-of-semester email.\u201d\n\t\tGet our newsletter, DP Daybreak, delivered to your inbox every weekday morning.This disparity in advising quality means that some students are at a great disadvantage compared to others. While some advisors are able to \u201cpoint students in the right direction,\u201d helping them take the right step forward in their college experience, others fall short. Their advisees must navigate the complicated process of learning about the majors, gen-ed requirements, and figuring out (the surprisingly difficult) advance registration process on their own.\nWhen done right, the freedom of the College curriculum can allow students to truly delve into their academic interests and eventually settle on the right path for them. However, that process requires a lot of research and planning that is supposed to be aided by a pre-major advisor. For incoming first years who are unfamiliar with the landscape at Penn and underclassmen students, this disparity in advising quality poses a challenge. Penn must ensure that all students are able to best utilize the resources at their disposal, and the first place to start is with the guidance they receive.\nJESSEY SHIN is a College first-year studying sociology and communications from Seongnam-si, South Korea.

This month offers an opportunity to delve into the depths of history: exploring narratives that challenge, inspire, and provoke thought. In the spirit of true academic inquiry and in honor of this significant month, I wish to highlight a selection of works by Black authors whose perspectives might diverge from the more commonly embraced interpretations of Black history and culture.\n\t\tIn recommending these texts, my intention is not to endorse every opinion expressed by the authors, but to underscore the importance of engaging with a diversity of viewpoints. These authors challenge us to look beyond the prevailing orthodoxy and to question the narratives that have become commonplace within academic circles. They remind us that the Black American experience, like any aspect of human history, is richly diverse and complex.\nAs members of an academic community that prides itself on intellectual rigor and openness, it is our responsibility to explore a broad spectrum of perspectives, especially those that provoke debate and reflection.

          "title": "Francesco Salamone | Is Penn about liberal arts or elite jobs?",
          "article_content": "\u201cWelcome to Penn! You are the most diverse class we ever admitted!\u201d The convocation rhetoric makes you feel so special. Penn is diverse because a student comes from Wisconsin and another from Kazakhstan. One plays the flute, one plays squash. Never mind that all of them want to be bankers or consultants. I wish someone had told me that nearly every other person sitting at Convocation with me would end up in the funnel. That however diverse my first-year class was, my senior class would simply not be.\nAs a teaching assistant for Wharton\u2019s required \u201cBusiness and You\u201d leadership course, I mentor first years adjusting to college and exploring careers. Someone confessed, \u201cIf not banking, then what else could I possibly do?\u201d If the best business school in the world (U.S. News debates aside) makes you believe you only have one option from day one, the institution, culture, and entire system have fundamentally failed.\n\t\tOf course, there is nothing wrong with those jobs: The last thing we need is a trembling economic system and inefficient markets. The problem is blindly assuming that one in two employed Penn grads and 80% of Wharton grads woke up and consciously made such a decision. Unpacking our culture proves how little of a decision this is and how everything revolves around two words: prestige and control.\nIt is common knowledge by now that Penn students are privileged. However, you may not know that for every single student from the bottom 20%, over 21 people come from the top 20%, blithely offsetting their upbringing. The result? An abject elite detached from reality. Okay, perhaps this is cynical, but if we are known for our elitist \u201cseeing and being seen\u201d culture, is it a surprise that 25% of us are so disillusioned to think the average U.S. salary is above six figures? Of course not (both not surprising and not true).\n\t\t\t\tPenn\u2019s alarming lack of socioeconomic diversity (despite efforts acknowledged this) unequivocally creates a culture perpetuating the value of money at the expense of everything else. The people you sit next to in class distract you with their laptop screens: purchasing a Gucci bag or booking Airbnbs in Cancun. The emails you receive are about banking and consulting events. This is the model. The only one. The only one, right?\nLet\u2019s be honest, \u201cjust follow your passion\u201d won\u2019t pay the bills, and I cannot blame an indebted or underprivileged student for desiring financial freedom with a high-paying job. This is why I am not saying the Wall Street lifestyle is unethical, although like others, I could. I am saying this is only one way to live your life. One of infinitely many. Which one makes sense for YOU?\n\tEveryone at Penn is good at planning, several are good at doing, and almost none are good at reflecting. The purpose of your college education is not exclusively career preparation. If this is what they had you do, I hate to tell you that you have been robbed. As writer William Deresiewicz argues, \u201cWhat you should want to develop in college is the habit of reflection, which means the capacity for change because most of what you come across in college will inevitably fade from memory. What is left over, precisely, is you.\u201d A culture, even more so an institution, should give you the tools to understand what model of life you want to live, not impose the model on you.\nYet, my student's question is central and inevitable: What else if not banking?\nAsking yourself what truly energizes you is no easy task, because it requires the vulnerability to let go of the comforting lifetime certainty that the predetermined path gives you: 2025 summer recruiting, analyst, associate \u2026 Well, the desire to eliminate uncertainty eliminates life. What do you plan to do after \u201csome years of experience\u201d with your future free time and why on earth are you not doing it now?\nIn his book \u201cExcellent Sheep,\u201d Deresiewicz advocates for the importance of time off, slowing down, breaking the cycle of endless achievement, and acknowledging the existence of a world outside of your Ivy League.

Yes, it was founded for them, but Penn\u2019s core mission today is the pursuit, enhancement, and dissemination of knowledge. We need to be aware of and manage our bewitching instinct to desire control and the social need for status. The truth is you cannot eradicate control and prestige. Just stop watering them. Like the French say, \u201cl\u00e2cher prise.\u201d\nLiberal education puts everything at risk and requires you to risk everything.

          "article_content": "Columnist Mariana Martinez describes her personal experiences with Penn's dining services.A text from my friend lit up my phone.\u00a0\n\u201cDude, you\u2019re literally getting the reverse Freshman 15!\u201d\n\t\t\u201cThe what?\u201d I replied.\nAs an international student, I had no idea that Freshman 15 was a thing. But by the time I found out what it was, it was already too late. My eating schedule became very irregular: I skipped meals thinking it was more practical for me. Because of Penn\u2019s poor dining services and few inclusive food options, my physical and mental health were severely affected by the end of my first semester.\u00a0\n\t\t\t\t\ufeffBefore coming to Penn, when people asked me what I would miss most from Colombia, I usually answered by saying I'd miss the food. But as my first semester flew by, I realized it went beyond missing my country\u2019s food and more into an overwhelming transition and violent adjustment to the American diet, characterized by fast-food consumption, takeout over-reliance, and a lack of fresh food. It made my transition to college even more overwhelming than it already was.\u00a0\nI never expected diet to pose the challenge it did during my first semester. I didn\u2019t expect my food options to narrow so suddenly. The differences between the American and other countries\u2019 diets cause international students to mess up their meal structure. In the midst of the American diet, breakfast becomes the least important meal, meal times become arbitrary, and late dinners are frequent.\u00a0\n\tI found myself skipping breakfast because I couldn\u2019t tolerate American breakfast foods: bacon, potatoes, sausage, casseroles. I stopped eating fruit, and I started eating only one large meal a day. At the same time, I was pushing myself to be my best in my classes, clubs, and job while running on very little fuel. By winter break, my body was pretty much destroyed.\nAs I asked other international students about their dining habits, I found that my experience was not an isolated one. Some of them told me that they \u201cjust don\u2019t know what to eat anymore.\u201d Others said that because of their international status, they had a limited budget to eat off-campus and that relying on Penn\u2019s terrible food was torturous.\u00a0\nSurveys have shown that as international students transition into their lives at American universities, many face dietary challenges and health consequences. For instance, many international students report a halt in their fruit and vegetable consumption because they believe the United States\u2019 options are not as fresh. Others report severe weight loss/gain and stomach issues from struggling to adapt to an American diet that consists mainly of meals large in sugars and fat.\u00a0\nBack in Colombia, I was used to having almost five meals a day. My diet included cereals and a variety of meats, vegetables, and fruits. Other international students also report being accustomed to multi-course meals, often characterized by a careful, homemade preparation. On the other hand, the American diet narrows down choices abruptly. International students describe their choices as pizza, salad, pasta, French fries, sandwiches, and chicken \u2014 which holds true to the quintessential Penn dining experience.\u00a0\n\t\tGet our newsletter, DP Daybreak, delivered to your inbox every weekday morning.Being thrown into a poor dietary environment has a significant impact on students\u2019 mental health. Many studies show that students with poor dietary conditions are more likely to suffer from depression and anxiety. The dietary conditions at Penn have impacted my emotional well-being: It is very frustrating to feel like I have no high-quality dining options. The strain on my wallet as I buy groceries and off-campus food is also stressful, considering around a third of Penn\u2019s international students are on financial aid.\u00a0\nThe international student experience with the food at Penn can only be described as aggravating. Not only is the American diet more unhealthy than food in international students\u2019 countries, but it also causes disruptions in meal structure and health. As a school that prides itself on being diverse, Penn should really focus on making the dining experience more accessible for its international students. Not to mention an improvement in the food would benefit the whole student body, given recent events. It is clear that this becomes a matter beyond just food: it\u2019s also about inclusivity, general well-being, and enjoying the college experience.\u00a0\nMARIANA MARTINEZ is a College first year studying English and classics from Bogot\u00e1, Colombia.

          "title": "Chapin Lenthall-Cleary | The Penn administration farcically mistreats new student clubs",
          "article_content": "Guest Columnist Chapin Lenthall-Cleary highlights the bureaucratic hurdles that face student organizations and clubs at Penn.It's no secret that many of the University's student clubs are brutally exclusive \u2014 often demanding prospective members submit applications and participate in interviews \u2014 only to bar most of them from participating anyway. It's no secret that this system of club exclusivity inflicts a variety of harms on students: It deprives them of opportunities to participate in academic, service, recreational, and other activities. It shuts them out of a significant avenue of making friends. It pits students against each other. It furthers a culture obsessed with credentials over learning (or whatever a club's mission might be). And, as if all of that weren't damaging enough, it wastes non-trivial amounts of students' limited time at the University.\u00a0\nIt's far less well known, however, that the University's administration \u2014 especially the Office of Student Affairs \u2014 imposes numerous stringent, farcical, and sometimes nearly insurmountable hurdles upon new, often open-membership clubs.\u00a0\n\t\tIn October 2022, I founded Penn Humans vs. Zombies (HvZ), a (then-unofficial) club that held live-action zombie apocalypse games with Nerf blasters in David Rittenhouse Laboratory. The games were open to everyone and attracted a range of undergraduates across various schools, plus graduate students, alumni, a few students from nearby schools, and occasionally a professor. We required no applications or interviews, even for club leadership positions, which were filled by those willing to do the extra work to help run the games. Against even the advice of some club officers, I refused to charge admission.\u00a0\nI don't want to oversell this: Lance or not, I wasn't killing any windmills. One silly game with an earnest mission, of course, wasn't fixing a broken system, nor was HvZ the only open-membership club at Penn. But HvZ was at least one example of something the University desperately needs and badly, though not completely, lacks places for Penn students to find community and friends with shared interests, free from demands to run a marathon in a rat race just for a chance at being let in the gate. In fact, my uncompromisingly open-membership policies are exactly what even OSA claims to want.\n\t\t\t\tSEE MORE FROM \ufeffOPINION:\ufeffEmily Chang | No Senator, not all Asians are ChineseKiyah Akins | How I have been shaped by Black historyAbout a year passed before I realized that our zombies weren\u2019t the most soulless people HvZ would have to face. Last fall, after hearing about HvZ, the building manager contacted me, demanded that I stop the games, and revoked my 24/7 access to DRL. I reluctantly agreed to stop holding the games in DRL, but I reached out to the director of OSA to appeal the decision, where I was met with a tsunami of bureaucracy and an instruction to stop the games until they gave approval. The process involved meetings between multiple members of OSA, public safety, risk management, and others. When I asked to be involved in these discussions, I received the canned reply, \"[OSA has] not traditionally included students at this stage of conversation.\"\u00a0\nIt took over a month to get permission from OSA to continue the games and about as long to sort out the actual process of getting a space. There was just one problem: OSA's Kafka-and-friends committee decided that HvZ had to occur in an athletic space. When I tried to rent such a space, I discovered that doing so would cost $75 an hour, or around $4,500 per semester for a four-hour game once a week, an impossible cost for our club. When I told the OSA director that having to pay this fee to continue our game would be as good as a death sentence for HvZ and asked for the fee to be waived or paid, I was told to go find funding. I'll say that again: We spent months waiting, only to be told that we needed to find a way to get the University to pay us thousands of dollars \u2014 that we'd use to pay Penn the fee they decided to charge us \u2014 to play a game that costs them nothing.\n\tI did everything the OSA director suggested and more to try to get funding. As it currently stands, we have only a small fraction of what we actually need. And, I'm not hopeful, because this isn't the first time I've tried to get funding for a club.\u00a0\nLast winter, I founded Drone Club, another open-membership club. This one was dedicated to building drones, and I was willing to teach less experienced students the electronics, soldering, physics, and skills involved in doing so. Initially, I paid largely out-of-pocket for parts, but this wasn't ideal or particularly sustainable, so I sought club funding. With significant effort and about a month's delay, we got $220, about half of what we requested, from the Common Funding Application, the very funding source the OSA director suggested we use to find thousands of dollars for HvZ. In fall 2023, in order to secure larger, more regular funding, I applied for SAC recognition, the primary avenue for regular club funding, for Drone Club.\u00a0\nDrone Club was rejected for the sole reason of not having been on the PennClubs website since Oct. 31, 2022 (yes, that\u2019s over a year before we applied, and it\u2019s different from the deadline listed on the SAC website). The stated reason for the requirement that inspired that rejection is that \"student groups must be sustainable,\" which requiring students to check a box a year in advance obviously does little to confirm. Indeed, as I noted in Drone Club's application, where I asked SAC \"not to reject us upon a technicality, and instead judge us upon our merits,\" Drone Club's mostly underclassman membership is an infinitely better metric for sustainability.\u00a0\nEven clubs that are accepted still aren't written into the SAC budget until the school year after applying. Combined together, these requirements mean that, even if nothing goes wrong, a new club takes years to receive SAC budget funding. Under the current system, a sophomore who started a club now would graduate before having a chance at seeing any SAC budget funding.\u00a0\nThe above is only a small fraction of the examples of Penn institutions' hostility towards new clubs: being denied tables at the activity fair, having Drone Club removed from the PennClubs website for not getting Engineering Student Activities Council recognition (which, according to the PennClubs website, isn't a requirement), and more. If you're shocked by the severity and regularity of this problem, keep in mind that these are only examples of the University's administration\u2019s hostility towards new, open-membership clubs that I run (and therefore know about), which are doubtlessly a tiny subset of the full problem.\u00a0\n\t\tGet our newsletter, DP Daybreak, delivered to your inbox every weekday morning.Despite this relentless onslaught, I still don't know how this story ends. There's still a scenario where a powerful administrator decides to put the welfare of students above rules and diktats, and says, \"Enough of this nonsense,\" and HvZ gets to return triumphantly to DRL, or at least to another good location, free from extortionate fees. There's still a scenario where Drone Club secures its funding for parts, and the many other clubs doubtlessly facing similar farcical obstacles are instead met with a well-lit road, not numerous Harnwell-and-a-half-high hurdles. Heck, there's still a scenario where OSA lives up to its stated ideals and starts staunchly supporting open-membership clubs and exerting real force to get closed-membership clubs to open up.\u00a0\nThis hasn't been a happy story, and I'm frankly not betting on that changing. Nor, sadly, would a single exception for HvZ solve this massive harm to students, thrilled though I\u2019d be to get such an exception. But this story isn\u2019t over yet. If enough people, or even one person with enough power, decide to end this farce today and decide that doing right by students must always come first, there could yet be not only a happy ending to HvZ's struggle but also a bright future for all open-membership clubs at the University. To the administrators who\u2019ve caused this damage and to those who have the power to fix it, shape up.\nCHAPIN LENTHALL-CLEARY is a College senior studying physics and philosophy from Radnor, Pa.

          "article_content": "This semester, I somehow ended up with four out of my five classes being either directly or indirectly about ethics. As a political science major, I was really excited to take these classes, since whenever people talk about ethics nowadays, it mostly has to do with politics or international relations.\nAt a time when our reality changes so rapidly because of technology, and when we are faced with a number of global challenges, some people have forgotten about the importance of acting morally. Especially at a place like Penn, where everyone seems to be extremely worried about their future and their careers, people often disregard these values when they are caught up by the competitive environment. Because of this, one would think that ethics classes would be extremely beneficial for all, but do they actually contribute to making students more ethical individuals?\n\t\tAccording to my professors, they don\u2019t.\nIn all four ethics classes, my professors started the semester by telling us that ethics classes will not make most of us more ethical. I sat there, listening to all of them, and I just could not understand why they would say something like that. If I wasn\u2019t going to learn anything, what was the point of taking these classes?\n\t\t\t\tSEE MORE FROM ZARA TENA:The urgent need for younger voices in politics\ufeffIt\u2019s okay to be ordinaryThat\u2019s where I was wrong: I have been learning a lot. While perhaps the main goal of ethics classes is not to turn students into more ethical people, they definitely give us the tools we need to critically engage with ethical dilemmas. By taking these classes, I might not become a better person, but they have given me a space where I can explore, discuss, and reflect about where I stand on so many issues and what my beliefs about morality actually are.\nEthics is not a subject that can be forcefully taught through lectures and readings. There is no way that we can sit down for three hours every week and magically become more ethical just because we memorize theories and read long papers written by old white men. The goal of these classes is not to tell us what is \u2018right\u2019 or \u2018wrong,\u2019 \u00a0but to give us the skills to navigate the gray areas in ethical decision making.\n\tThese classes encourage self reflection and personal growth. Even when analyzing big case studies or exploring different theories, students are pushed to question their own values, beliefs, and biases. While this may not guarantee that we will completely transform our moral compasses, the self awareness that comes from these reflections creates a great foundation for understanding why we act the way we do and also invites us to try to understand others.\nThe fact that ethics classes begin with a warning \u2014 that you won\u2019t become more ethical by taking them \u2014 should not stop anyone from giving them a chance. The ability to think critically, understand different values and perspectives, and have the skills to self reflect are essential parts of any college education. They prepare students for the complicated moral dilemmas they might face in their personal and professional lives \u2014 especially when most people at Penn will end up with jobs that are notorious for their ethical scandals!\nZARA TENA is a College sophomore studying political science from Puebla, Mexico.

          "article_content": "How many times have you found yourself in a never-ending cycle of back-and-forth messages, trying to pin down a date for a long overdue catch up with a friend? Every get together begins to feel as if it requires intricate planning and strips away the simplicity of social connection. This routine becomes stifling, lacking spontaneity and authenticity; you\u2019re constrained to coordinating with the same faces in the same places.\u00a0\nThis is what I like to call scheduling fatigue.\u00a0\n\t\tAs a result of this phenomenon, gatherings among friends are beginning to resemble scheduled business meetings, meticulously arranged via tools like When2Meet or synchronized Google Calendars.\nWhile resorting to scheduling may seem like the only viable option to maintain a semblance of social connection, perhaps it's time to embrace the idea of venturing out solo: I\u2019m challenging you to go on an unplanned side quest all by yourself to a third place.\u00a0\n\t\t\t\tMORE FROM LALA MUSTAFA:A nation on defense: Dismantling misinformation against Azerbaijan in the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict\ufeff\ufeffAllow me to explain. Picture the first place as your home and the second as your place of education or work. Now, the third place emerges as a public sphere where individuals congregate, not out of any obligation like in the previously mentioned locations, but, for lack of a more precise term, to simply vibe. It could be the cozy corner of a cafe, a communal park, or even the neighborhood barbershop \u2014 anywhere that\u2019ll allow you to interact with people outside your usual circles.\u00a0\nYet, at many universities like Penn, the concept of a third place seems all but lost as our lives remain restricted to school grounds, causing even our first and second places to converge into one. While spots on campus \u2014 like Stommons, Pret, or the cultural centers in ARCH \u2014 can offer some respite, they often come with the latent pressure of being on the clock. Conversations here revolve around assignments, internships, and the intricacies of Penn culture. The chances of an unexpected encounter dwindle given that most people in attendance will be other Penn students. As we\u2019re cocooned in the Penn bubble, it comes as no surprise that many students spend their four years in Philadelphia without ever fully exploring it.\u00a0\n\tYet, this insulation comes at a cost that extends far beyond what we realize.\u00a0\nIt severs our connection not only from the outside world but also from ourselves. That is, within such limits, our individuality dwindles, reducing us to mere roles influenced by our peers. By excluding ourselves from a wider social sphere, we inhibit opportunities to engage with diverse perspectives, trap ourselves in a cycle of familiarity, and risk leading monotonous lives that pave the way to burnout.\nHowever, in our lives, both intimacy and affiliation with broader communities are essential. While intimacy often stems from our immediate circles, affiliation thrives in third places where spontaneous interactions occur. These spaces facilitate easy contact with new individuals on a regular basis, without the need for prior scheduling. As they consistently offer an opportunity for interaction with others, they end up cultivating the most reliable form of socialization.\u00a0\nSo, if you are keen on exploring new horizons and getting involved in the Philadelphia community, I suggest checking out the many informative articles dedicated to bursting the Penn bubble.\nNevertheless, I want to avoid confining third places to physical locations. They\u2019re more of a mindset, a willingness to embrace spontaneity wherever it may arise. They don't have to be far from campus or require spending money. Instead, third places can be any informal spots you visit \u2014 whether it's your student lounge, the library, or a community center.\u00a0\n\t\tGet our newsletter, DP Daybreak, delivered to your inbox every weekday morning.We often find ourselves caught up in the routines of daily life, clinging to familiar patterns of scheduling and social interaction.

          "title": "Beatriz B\u00e1ez | No closed captioning available",
          "article_content": "Columnist Beatriz B\u00e1ez explains her experience with language fatigue at Penn.On my first day at Penn, I called my father in distress, telling him I needed to move back home and study there as I was going to die alone at this university. My father asked why, and I quickly responded, \u201cI haven\u2019t met anybody in three hours. I have no friends. It\u2019s over for me.\u201d\u00a0\nThat very same night, I went to a New Student Orientation event at Houston Hall. As I nervously paced the floor in my Crocs, I overheard some students speaking Spanish and immediately gravitated toward them. Confessing, \u201cI heard Spanish, and I feel saved,\u201d I ended up meeting three genuine individuals, all from various parts of Latin America. Having arrived in the United States, it felt comforting to hear voices that reminded me of home. This comfort is priceless in such a foreign environment.\n\t\tAll my life, I\u2019ve taken courses in Spanish, spoken Spanish at home, and been berated by my grandmother whenever I spoke too much English. Arriving at Penn, I didn\u2019t anticipate the struggle I would face taking classes taught in English, as I had been lucky enough to have been extensively taught English from a very young age.\nBut speaking in a second language most of the time, even as a fluent speaker, is incredibly draining. Meeting native Spanish speakers at Penn was truly a blessing. However, I have found that some people react adversely to me speaking my primary language. These are not continuous reactions of a high degree, but there have been enough small instances to mark me.\u00a0\n\t\t\t\tMORE ON THIS TOPIC:Students celebrate 40th annual Festival Latinx, honoring Latinx culture on campusLa Casa Latina celebrates 2023 Latinx Heritage Month at PennOn various occasions, I have had Latinx friends say, \u201cLet\u2019s speak English so X person doesn\u2019t feel excluded,\u201d or even resort to English for \u201cconvenience\u201d when we\u2019re alone. For the former, I understand the sentiment. I wouldn\u2019t want someone to be excluded from a conversation in such a way. However, when I\u2019m naturally speaking Spanish, having my speech interpreted as a personal offense is off-putting.\u00a0\nIn one instance, I met a student through a mutual friend on a night out. This friend and I speak fluent Spanish; the person I had just met did not. Throughout the night, I had various conversations with my new acquaintance \u2014 who I found quite amicable \u2014 and my friend. I would naturally speak Spanish with the latter, not thinking much of it. The next morning, my friend told me how the new acquaintance felt I hated them for speaking Spanish in front of them, knowing they didn\u2019t speak the language.\u00a0\n\tI was shocked by the assumption and, in all honesty, a little offended. I found it quite conceited that one would think another person is speaking in their first language to actively exclude them. Speaking in a first language, for me, is purely a relief issue. Although I am fluent in English, after an entire week of speaking it, it can be extremely draining; thus, particularly in a social setting, I don\u2019t want to add to the exhaustion.\u00a0\nIt is more than fine to be curious about what somebody is saying and ask for a translation. However, immediately expressing discomfort upon hearing another language and presuming the other person is talking badly about you is inconsiderate toward them. More often than not, this language switch is for comfort. This was the first of sufficient instances that exposed a pattern in my time at Penn. In another class, I grew close to a few other Spanish-speaking students. One of them continuously suggested we switch back to English for seemingly no valid reason and would reply to any comment of mine in English.\u00a0\nThis harsh reality on campus expands into the club scene. In one instance, a native English speaker attended a club meeting primarily led in Spanish. Within this meeting, if club members asked questions in Spanish, any other members who answered quickly switched to English. Evidently, the intent is to have everybody be able to partake in conversation. However, members within a Spanish-led group should be able to detach from English formalities within club meetings, particularly if the club seeks to embrace Latinx heritage.\u00a0\nSpeaking in my primary language is the greatest manifestation of my culture, particularly since Spanish accents are so diverse throughout Latin America. Having to switch to English not only in academic settings but in seemingly every other sphere of Penn life further disconnects me from the culture I\u2019ve been surrounded by my entire life until now. This applies to any person whose main language isn\u2019t English, not only to Spanish speakers.\u00a0\n\t\tGet our newsletter, DP Daybreak, delivered to your inbox every weekday morning.Penn has students from over 100 countries, with around 19% of the student body being international. If one truly wants to immerse themselves in Penn\u2019s multilingual community, one needs to recognize that a language barrier works both ways. Just as an English speaker may be tired from learning another language, a non-English speaker can be drained from constantly speaking English. It\u2019s crucial to recognize that for the latter, multilingualism surpasses a simple language requirement and spills over to nearly every sector of their life at Penn.\u00a0\nLanguage fatigue is a true reality, especially for individuals who haven\u2019t learned English from a young age. Thus, if somebody within your social group is speaking their first language, which you are not fluent in, it does not give you the right to feel offended or urge them to speak in a tongue you understand. And, if you are a non-native English speaker, as much as you can, \"habla en tu primer idioma y que los dem\u00e1s se ubiquen.\"\nBEATRIZ B\u00c1EZ is a College first year studying mathematics and political science from San Juan, Puerto Rico.

In our instruction at the University of Pennsylvania, we were told to reach for safety and to secure our decadence.

We were never meant to become the fools and tools of the mythic America: the one that is superior, war-hungry, greedy, and hypocritical. These choices did their damage. That was an aberration. Now, we are entering a time of correction.\u00a0\n\tWe want to know the meaning of our lives when we live in a country whose hand assassinates a man and poet as beautiful and courageous as Refaat Alareer, when we live in a society in which Aaron Bushnell had to die so that humanity could live. When the youngest students of Philadelphia stand to say they are no different from the children of Palestine, that the bombs dropped abroad also explode in our neighborhoods, we then know it is true for ourselves \u2014 that we bleed the same as these children in Palestine, as all the men and women we encounter in Philadelphia.\u00a0\nOur bondage to the genocide in Gaza is through the struggle to become moral human beings in America, and to relinquish our country from the myths that strangle us and our people.\u00a0\nIt is unmistakable that the education Penn offers is bankrupt, and that some cancer, invisible but detectable, poisons our relationships to each other and to ourselves. The scramble for acceptance into mediocre clubs and fraternities is insufferable, and the false authority these groups stand on in order to make these judgments is embarrassing. Within this sea and storm of immoral standards, the truth and our touchstone live in the broader historic moment \u2014 the crisis we know and the possibilities we see.\u00a0\n\t\tGet our newsletter, DP Daybreak, delivered to your inbox every weekday morning.The real task of Penn students is the same as it always has been: to be present in their lives, in this city, to examine and test the assumptions they have inherited, to develop a coherent worldview that explains the reality before them. To investigate and challenge the standards of their education, peers, and professors. And to then act and live by these new definitions, through which we will discover freedom. The world makes us, and we make it, too.\u00a0\nIf we were meant to become the leaders of this country and makers of history, as so many of us have been told from youth into maturity \u2014 that we are capable of this \u2014 then this is our role to fulfill: a brave, original, and purposeful life that skirts the frontier of new standards for this nation.

          "title": "Hanadi Abdulkadir | How poor dining hall food shapes our mental and academic capabilities",
          "article_content": "At this point, many Penn students have lived the terrible dining stories at a number of halls across campus. While it\u2019s important to discuss the health and sanitary risks associated with some of these concerns, it\u2019s also necessary to break down how this problem factors into students\u2019 academic and mental well-being.\u00a0\nOpening Sidechat every few days to see yet another picture of undercooked meat or hearing horror stories from my friends dissuades me from trekking across campus to eat at many of our dining halls. Oftentimes, I find myself skipping meals or stretching the time out between each one \u2014 until I accept the fact that I\u2019ll be eating the same food I already ate a couple times that week. Does this mean that I\u2019m probably missing out on some of the necessary vitamins or fiber I should be getting daily? Probably.\n\t\tNumerous Penn Dining Wellness emails live in our inboxes with tips on improving digestive health and practicing better healthy habits in our daily lives. Additionally, the official page for Penn Dining boasts awards and recognitions for sustainability and top college dining. However, the pristine and glossy promotional pictures of sandwiches, smoothies, and breakfast bowls tell a completely different story from the reality on campus.\nWith two of the most historical repeat offenders \u2014 Hill House and 1920 Commons \u2014 being the only consistent options available for on campus dining during the weekend, it\u2019s much more convenient to resort to the other retail spots scattered around campus. However, some of these locations are far apart, depending on where you live, and can add additional costs to weekly expenses. \u00a0\n\t\t\t\tSEE MORE FROM HANADI ABDULKADIR:\ufeffPenn should require an African American history courseWhy social media and Palestinian activism goes hand in handAdditionally, for students who are dishing out a hefty sum of money to enroll in the dining plan, going out of their way to seek expensive alternatives takes away money that could\u2019ve been better spent elsewhere. Considering that first years and sophomores are required to pick a dining plan for their first two years at Penn, it\u2019s no wonder that students have consistently called for the food standards to match the high prices of these meal swipes. Ideally, no student should feel like they need to resort to options outside of Penn; rather, outside options should be supplemental to an already quality level of options at all dining halls.\u00a0\nSince coming to Penn, my relationship with food has become much more complex. I need to look twice when picking out a seemingly clean utensil to eat whatever is on my plate or stare extra hard at my salad with suspicion before consuming it. But growing up, food was always a way for me to connect with my family and friends, to bring us back together even when we hadn\u2019t seen each other in a long time. Yet the food at Penn, at its worst, has left me frustrated and succeeded at suppressing my appetite \u2014 something I actually can relate to other students about.\n\tAlthough certain foods are scientifically linked to improving mental clarity and focus, I hesitate in reaching for those vegetables because they don\u2019t look as fresh or appetizing when lined up on display in Kings Court English House. As a result, I look for short-term solutions in coffee, which leaves me feeling tired earlier in the day or exhausted while trying to tackle my assignments at night. In order to meet my immediate deadlines, I prioritize some assignments over others, meaning some classes suffer in academic performance and perpetuate an almost never-ending cycle of playing catch-up. I believe that the root cause of all these problems can be traced back to the lack of decent dining.\u00a0\nThis same sentiment has been echoed by many of my friends and peers. But the dining quality at Penn can be mitigated if the University addresses the root problem. Whether that be promoting clean and sanitary workspaces when handling food or streamlining student complaints to Penn Dining other than through email, the University can restore student faith in the system. When it comes to campus dining, Penn can improve upon our experiences by implementing the changes that students deserve to enjoy, especially at the height of midterm season.\nHANADI ABDULKADIR is a College sophomore studying international relations from Philadelphia.

          "article_content": "During Penn\u2019s recent administrative upheaval, the University community found an unexpected silver lining: For the first time, Penn was making headlines alongside Harvard and MIT.\u00a0\nThe presidents of these three institutions were at the center of an infamous congressional hearing in December after their alleged missteps on campus antisemitism. I\u2019ll admit, there is something far more distasteful about chaos at the Capitol than the collective HYPSM prestige.\n\t\tBut many of us are taking our education at Penn for granted, shedding our \u201cque ser\u00e1, ser\u00e1\u201d optimism, and wondering at times what it would be like to go to a more recognizable Ivy. For decades, we\u2019ve all but exhausted our morale by clarifying to passersby that no, Penn State and Penn are not the same university. And yes, Penn is actually active in areas outside of Wharton\u2019s finance programs.\nSo, when Penn Engineering announced its new undergraduate program in artificial intelligence, many of us were enthusiastic about the University\u2019s growing role in the innovation sector: a space thought to be dominated by less business-oriented institutions.\n\t\t\t\tSEE MORE FROM MRITIKA SENTHIL: Removing legacy admissions will align Penn\u2019s actions more closely with its educational missionWhy changing leadership won\u2019t eliminate antisemitism at PennBut Penn\u2019s realization, of possibly its most practical initiative, begs the question: Is the University actually necessary in DevOps? Does sitting in a classroom \u2014 let alone one that\u2019s in the midst of a campus known for its influx of finance bros \u2014 really supersede what can be MacGyvered by a tech junkie with only a laptop, caffeine, and time? I want to give a definite \u201cno.\u201d Otherwise, I would need to hold my classmates and myself accountable for upholding all the exclusivity that comes with attending Penn. And yet, there are a frustrating number of anonymous netizens, D-list journalists, and LinkedIn bards who call Ivy League universities like Penn \u201cout of touch\u201d \u2014 remnants of centuries-old American elitism in an era of bottom-up grassroots movements.\nOne C-suite executive anticipates that \u201cthe best AI engineers and builders won\u2019t graduate Penn Engineering. They'll be global, builders and in the right group chats.\u201d His readers agree, with one commenter further emphasizing that \u201cuniversities cannot keep up with the pace of free market innovation.\u201d When these schools attempt to go against the grain and align with consumer needs, \u201cit genuinely looks embarrassing and out of date.\u201d\n\tIn an environment where the use of AI models is largely democratized, we\u2019re naturally drawn to the trope of a layperson who forgoes bureaucratic systems to channel their intelligence: creating life-changing inventions that would have never come to be under self-serving corporate and political influences. And when ignoring cases of succor \u2014 as mainstream media unfortunately does \u2014 there are many examples of such successes. Bill Gates and Paul Allen, co-founders of Microsoft, were university dropouts. So were Meta Platforms co-founders Mark Zuckerberg and Dustin Moskovitz. As Penn\u2019s over reliance on donors came to light earlier this school year, critics of the upper crust have continued to group Penn with other perpetrators of social stratification. The field of AI is, by nature, continuously evolving. And limiting growth in the discipline to those who can afford, and then succeed in Penn\u2019s Department of Computer and Information Science courses is counterproductive.\nHowever, these narratives misrepresent the intentions of Penn\u2019s AI program.\nTo make a better case for Penn\u2019s AI major, I spoke with Robert Ghrist, Andrea Mitchell Professor and associate dean for undergraduate education at Penn Engineering. He describes how the process of integrating AI in education is similar to the effects of increasing access to music recording and playback technologies. Now, there is \u201cmore music for everyone at much lower prices,\u201d he told me. Nonetheless, \u201cartists at the very top of the industry\u201d are increasingly the benefactors of \u201ca concentration of rewards.\u201d Taylor Swift is, as any current news feed can attest to, perhaps the most prolific embodiment of such phenomena. And professor Ghrist strives to make Penn an incubator of sorts for the \u201cTaylor Swifts of AI\u201d that seek avenues for academic growth, to actually be the \u201cleading edge where the best thrive.\u201d\nAnd to thrive in this discipline, aspiring AI mavens are off course by simply memorizing browser instructions in JavaScript and praying for a tech equivalent of the coveted Goldman Sachs internship. After all, studying AI is a philosophical pursuit: an inquiry into the nature of consciousness and ethics of creating sentient machines. It\u2019s also a political pursuit, for AI poses challenges in regulatory compliance. There are countless possible liabilities for even the most basic ChatGPT input, such as unprotected user data and violations of intellectual property rights. \u00a0\n\t\tGet our newsletter, DP Daybreak, delivered to your inbox every weekday morning.Needless to say, as you might have noticed in my earlier columns, I am not an AI major. I\u2019m not even enrolled in Penn Engineering. Am I, of all students, in the right to quash critics of the Penn AI major when I dropped AP Computer Science in high school (with no regrets)?\nYet, it\u2019s clearly irresponsible to follow the well-intentioned advice from tech capitalists when constant innovation is not particularly ideal for society. Maybe I\u2019m just afraid of a \"Black Mirror\"-esque dystopia, but there is a kind of ominous quality to the idea of highly skilled AI scientists off the reins. Penn, however, is cultivating an ecosystem that nurtures AI talent, albeit not by stifling the next Elon Musk or Sam Altman with red-tape-ridden academics; instead, Penn fosters ethically conscious innovation that addresses complex societal challenges. And so, the fact that I can engage with the Penn curricula across departments has a surprising beauty. The opportunity to become a part of this technological movement \u2014 or, dare I say, revolution \u2014 is the gift of studying AI at Penn.\nMRITIKA SENTHIL is a first year studying management and Russian and east European studies from Columbia, S.C.

          "title": "Akiva Berkowitz | An AI major by any other name ",
          "article_content": "Artificial intelligence is a topic we can\u2019t seem to get enough of. From frequent announcements regarding policies within classrooms to endless professors and visiting scholars weighing in on the unprecedented effect large language models will have on our lives, I\u2019m sure we\u2019ve all discussed to death how revolutionary ChatGPT has become for college students.\u00a0\nMany of us have even had the chance to firmly establish positions on whether the University should embrace the technology wholeheartedly or put in place safeguards to prevent it from eroding the value of a college education, but up until now, the vast majority of conversations have been on a non-technical level.\n\t\tThat all potentially changed in this past month when Penn announced their first Bachelor of Science in Engineering in AI. Thankfully for us, Penn has chosen to launch this interdisciplinary degree at the \u201coptimal time\u201d to \u201ccreate a society where AI isn\u2019t just a tool, but a fundamental force for good to advance society.\u201d But at what cost? To what extent should we be using college as an opportunity to hyperfocus on not just a certain field (computer science), but a field within a field? Majoring in AI panders to the pre-professionalism Penn is known for and removes many of the foundational elements of the field that underlie innovation.\u00a0\nIn an interesting recent LinkedIn post, David Magerman pondered the implications of a university building complete undergraduate curriculums around a \u201cmodern business tool that is a niche application of computer science, diverting students away from a broad education in computer science.\u201d He went on to ask pointedly, \u201cWhat's next? A Bachelor of Arts in Blogging from the Annenberg School? A Wharton BS in Quantitative Trading?\u201d\n\t\t\t\tSEE MORE FROM AKIVA BERKOWITZ:The newsletter is dead\ufeffIsrael under attack: What do you stand for?As a current computer science major, I\u2019ll admit the AI curriculum looks fascinating. There is such an array of eye-catching electives (from Deep Generative Models to Natural Language Processing) that, if I were doing my degree all over again, I suspect I would have been swayed to switch into the major. But as a recently graduated computer and information science friend put it, the degree \u201cseems like the cool parts of CIS\u201d without the heavier basics like operating systems, computer systems, and physics \u2014 building blocks on the entire computer domain. \u00a0\nThe question I ask myself is whether artificial intelligence is really enough of an independent field that it transcends computer science and necessitates its own major. Is the relatively new field of AI established enough, broad enough, and unique enough such that the skills we gain through taking just those mostly career-focused courses today will undoubtedly remain relevant in 30 years and justify the $84,600 a year sticker price? I simply wonder how likely it may be that AI will become so unrecognizable in 20 or even 10 years, given its breakneck pace of innovation, that students may have wished that their majors in college focused on more fundamental elements of the field that innovators keep turning back to for insight.\u00a0\n\tAside from long-term career effectiveness an AI degree would have compared to computer science or electrical engineering, Penn is known for its pre-professional student body, and this new major shows signs of that sentiment leaking into the curriculum as well. In contrast to the Penn Integrates Knowledge professorships that bring in academic leaders who deeply understand multiple fields to better spark insight between them, this new major filters various courses of study to pluck out the elements we find valuable today.\u00a0\nIn this line of thinking, maybe we should consider the true value of a groundbreaking Wharton degree in quant trading that would promise to \u201csculpt the financial moguls of tomorrow\u201d with unparalleled prowess in algorithmic trading strategies and quantitative analysis.\u00a0\nAll this is to say, I immediately understand the value the current AI concentration within the larger CIS curriculum has. And I appreciate the Ph.D. programs that take students to a higher level of understanding, once they\u2019ve taken the time in their undergraduate training to build the broad foundations. I simply remain curious of the true value an AI undergraduate degree offers us as students over other forms of study within the field and the certain level of indulgence in pre-professionalism that it plays into on Penn\u2019s campus. I truly hope that I\u2019m proven wrong.\nAKIVA BERKOWITZ is an Engineering junior studying computer science from Silver Spring, Md.

          "article_content": "As busy college students, most of us do not have time to cook our own meals, and if you are anything like me, cooking is far from your forte. The hassle of having to go to the grocery store, cook, and clean can be time consuming and even more difficult when you\u2019re overwhelmed with classes, clubs, and homework. For the many students without access to a kitchen in their dorm, this presents an even bigger challenge. Luckily, college campuses have dining halls! Students simply swipe their card to get access to an all-you-care-to-eat dining experience. Dining halls provide easy access meals to students\u2014but what happens when that food is inedible?\nAs a picky eater, I know that simply because I do not like a dish does not mean it is unsafe to eat, but food with cockroaches and glass is unsafe for anyone. A seemingly obvious underlying assumption in dining is that food is safe to eat. College dining halls should be a place where students go to eat well-cooked, hairless, and insect-free food. However, that is not the case at Penn: There is a lack of responsibility to make sure the food is meeting basic standards for, let alone satisfying, all students.\u00a0\n\t\tMeal plans are far from cheap. For the sticker price, students would expect quality food, but they would be wrong. Both of the first-year student meal plan options cost $6,330, with the maximum amount of swipes being 296. Each meal swipe equates to roughly $17, which is about the same price as a Caniac Combo at Raising Cane's. As previously stated, Penn dining hall food is far from gourmet, and its price is too high for the quality delivered.\u00a0\nExpensive dining plan meals are not unique to Penn, but other Ivy League schools have similar prices for better quality food. Cornell University offers an unlimited meal plan, so students may visit the dining halls as much as they want with a fixed cost of $6,942 for food ranked second-best in the nation. So, for roughly 600 more dollars, Cornell students have access to unlimited meals and substantially better quality dining.\u00a0\n\t\t\t\tSEE MORE FROM ERIC NAJERA: \ufeffWe should be grateful to attend PennPenn clubs should have an assigned faculty member\ufeffAside from price and quality, weekend dining is another struggle. With the popular McClelland Sushi & Market and Houston Market being closed on Saturdays and the other dining halls closing at 8 p.m., food options are limited. Late-night study sessions means having to resort to local food places that remain open, and unlike nearby schools such as Drexel, our dining dollars do not work at off-campus restaurants and out-of-pocket money spent on takeout can add up quickly.\nBefore every school break, Sidechat is flooded with posts of excitement for home-cooked meals. In my classes, when asked what we are excited for, most students reply being able to eat good food. It is not uncommon for college students to miss their home-cooked meals, but when students are excited to actually eat food that is not served alongside insects, it signifies a problem.\n\tWith Penn\u2019s Bon App\u00e9tit contract still in place, we may not know how much Penn can do to change the dining experience. Safe, clean food should not be an unreasonable expectation. In order to enhance a student's experience outside the classroom, Penn must budget for an edible food experience for all students.\nERIC NAJERA is a College sophomore studying history from Rolling Meadows, Ill.

          "article_content": "We all know the typical \u201ctypes\u201d of high schoolers, the different clich\u00e9s: Where are my nerds at? But, another attribute of student groups that has become increasingly relevant in the 21st century United States is the diverse ethnic makeup of its population. And, frankly, do we as a campus mirror all that comes with that national trend of diversity?\nThink of the friends with whom you often hang out. Then, ask those friends with whom they usually go out. Finally, think of the groups you are a part of, the extracurriculars in which you partake. Notice a pattern?\n\t\t\u201c[D]espite increased opportunity to live and work in mixed-race settings, Americans remain racially segregated in their friendship patterns,\u201d a study published by the National Institutes of Health found. \u201cSpatial racism, cultural encapsulation, and personal choice are contributing factors for patterns of same-race friendships.\u201d\u00a0\nThis pattern seems to reflect the divisions present in Penn\u2019s social scene as well. Despite coming from all sorts of backgrounds across the world, the University\u2019s students appear to have unconsciously adopted a policy of self segregation. In other words, we like to \u201cstick to our own\u201d by socializing with others to whom we relate to on a cultural, ethnic, or religious basis. So, regardless of Penn\u2019s efforts to integrate people of differing experiences and beliefs, there still remains a degree of resistance by individuals themselves to cross those racial or cultural lines.\n\t\t\n\t\nAs a result, the potential for diversity of thought is threatened. A narrow mindset develops within these groups that students pledge to, and they effectively act as echo chambers that exacerbate already crippling political polarization. We relate to each other less, rely on our \u201cown\u201d more, and become less tolerant of the views, and thus experiences, of those who do not necessarily look, think, or speak like us.\nThis kind of thinking \u2014 whether manifested in the form of race, religion, or otherwise \u2014 has led to serious tension at times and enabled a distorted view of certain communities and how they experience Penn. I attribute part of that thinking not to the identity groups we are a part of, but to how much we value them over who we are as individuals.\n\tHomogenous communities definitely have their place in the college experience: They help ease our transition when we first arrive at Penn, and their role cannot be replaced. I say this as an international student myself, who had a hard time acclimating to an entirely different culture and, most radically, diet. Nonetheless, we should treat these organizations as an aid to finding belonging on campus, not a substitute for individual thought and expression.\nHowever, none of this means individuals can\u2019t agree or always need to separate themselves from the group. The use of a large, collective voice can benefit our campus much more than we realize. What is important to note is that there lies a clear distinction between acknowledging the views of others and forcing ourselves to accept those views for the sake of conformity.\nThere is nothing wrong with disagreeing with the majority, whether it is one against two or one against a nation (though some may try to tell you otherwise). As long as you are respectful and driven by a desire to learn rather than defend, there are no limits on what perspective you may question. So, challenge your beliefs, reevaluate your viewpoint, challenge that of others (no matter who they are), and then reevaluate yourself again. It\u2019ll be hard at first, to express your precise, genuine thoughts without fear. But, remember that you\u2019re not alone (I struggle sometimes myself) and that it\u2019s a process you won\u2019t always get right.\n\t\tGet our newsletter, DP Daybreak, delivered to your inbox every weekday morning.The hardest part of breaking out of groupthink, after realizing it, is talking about it. My advice? Take the plunge and never look back. The next time you are in a group and the majority agrees with an idea you don\u2019t like, let it be known. Talk about it and explain why you think the way you do. Don\u2019t worry if some get offended or others simply do not agree; it is normal and, in fact, expected.\u00a0\nNever forget that disputes you engage in are an opportunity, not a challenge, and our differences are enlightening, not threatening. Only then will we begin to understand and appreciate each other more as unique actors in a truly historic community.\nZAID ALSUBAIEI is a College first year studying economics from Al-Khobar, Saudi Arabia.

          "article_content": "I downloaded Sidechat this fall after my friends sent me too many screenshots of funny memes or jokes posted on the anonymous app. I figured that doing so would simply remove the middleman. I was already being exposed to the same jokes, memes, comments and judgements as those on the app anyway \u2026 right?\u00a0\nIn December, I returned home for reading days and fell into an easy pattern of studying. Nothing I did was wildly exciting or social, but I instead found myself enjoying the routine and satisfaction of productivity. During my study breaks, I would scroll on Sidechat \u2014 and from the comfort of my home, I felt myself spiraling into anxious dread about returning to Penn. Each time I opened the app, I was faced with a barrage of posts all echoing the same sentiment: Penn is awful and depressing. Without a second thought, I accepted those posts as fact, and in doing so, I allowed Sidechat to have more power than it deserves. In other words, I subscribed to the complaining culture that is pervasive on Sidechat.\u00a0\n\t\tUsing Sidechat, especially without intentional thought, is a way of looking at Penn through hypercritical glasses. Perhaps this is because negativity has been normalized and cynicism gets more upvotes. To some extent, this pessimistic messaging is diluted with the insertion of mildly entertaining memes or jokes, but the result is still the same. With each scroll, Sidechat is perpetuating a defeatist perspective of Penn.\u00a0\nSo, I arrived back at Penn to take my final exam: openly unhappy about returning to what I thought would be a bleak campus as a result of discourse on Sidechat. But to my surprise, it was not horrific, and I was able to enjoy my weekend of studying just as I had my week at home. The sheer volume of disheartening posts on Sidechat had clouded my perspective and ability to see the best in the situation. Sure, I was becoming one with a Huntsman GSR while others were at home enjoying break, but on the other hand, I was with my friends and able to have a sleepy campus all to myself.\n\t\t\t\tAs is the case with most other social media platforms, Sidechat is consumed passively and without a second thought \u2014 it\u2019s used to pass time, curb boredom, and satiate our addictions to our phones. And yet, students are absorbing and internalizing content more quickly than they can truly digest it.\u00a0\nGiven the bandwagon culture on Sidechat, users often build off of one another, creating a chaotic, and often dismal, echo chamber that does not truly represent life at Penn. Whether or not college is the best four years of your life, it is at least what you make of it, and Sidechat enables students to feel like victims of an unknown cause. For those who are actually struggling, Sidechat acts not as a productive outlet, but rather as a meta ether that provides no remedy other than the satisfaction that others are unhappy too.\u00a0\n\tSince winter break, I have in fact deleted Sidechat and am all the better for it. I still get sent the best and the brightest jokes by my friends, but I am no longer overwhelmed by unsolicited complaints on an hourly basis. Without Sidechat, my thoughts on the housing lottery, the floods in the Quad, and upcoming midterms are completely my own. Deleting Sidechat may not be for everyone, but it\u2019s imperative for those who chose to use Sidechat to take a more critical view of what is being circulated and evaluate whether or not they are benefiting from it. It may just change the way they see Penn.\u00a0\nELIZA CARROLL is a College first year studying international relations and art history from Greenwich, Conn.

As you walk through the brightly colored 40-foot paifang \u2014 known to most as Chinatown\u2019s Friendship Gate \u2014 you enter into a cultural oasis that has stood strong in the heart of Philadelphia for nearly 150 years. Beyond this fixture, Chinatown serves as a home to nearly 3,000 residents and numerous family-owned businesses, restaurants, shops, and community organizations. Whether you are going to Ken\u2019s Seafood Restaurant for a fun night out or Heng Fa for groceries, Chinatown feels like home.\u00a0\nUnfortunately, this community has been under constant attack for decades and is once again facing the threat of displacement and gentrification from a plan to develop an arena for the Philadelphia 76ers merely a block away. We firmly stand with the Students for the Preservation of Chinatown and urge you to do the same. \u00a0\n\t\tSince the early 1900s, Chinatown has been a victim of gentrification often driven by predatory infrastructure projects. In 1932, the construction of subway infrastructure at Ridge and Eighth streets \u2014 and the subsequent development of the Vine Street Expressway from 1957 to 1991 \u2014 resulted in the destruction of buildings and severe divisions within the community. Bringing in noise and pollution, the expressway eroded neighborhoods and people's quality of life. This was not Chinatown's sole battle, however, as it also faced multiple proposals of developments for a federal prison in 1992, a baseball stadium in 2000, and a casino in 2008.\u00a0\nThe story of Philadelphia's Chinatown mirrors other Chinatowns across the nation. Amid the 1994 fiscal crisis in Washington, D.C., then-Washington Wizards owner Abe Pollin negotiated a deal for the downtown Capital One Arena, where the city covered pre-development costs to acquire and demolish properties. Entrepreneurs in Washington's Chinatown voiced concerns about prices of real estate skyrocketing and parking impacts on businesses in the area. A decade later, most Chinese residents were forced to move out due to unaffordable housing. The parking shortage led to the closure of the last Chinese grocery store, accelerating the decline of the Chinese American population in the area to fewer than 400 residents today. Ironically, as D.C.\u2019s arena now relocates to the suburbs, the community is left behind, having endured irreversible destruction while in the midst of its recovery from the pandemic.\u00a0\n\t\t\t\tMORE FROM LIALA SOFI AND CATHY LI:Liala Sofi | The hypocrisy of billionaire philanthropistsCathy Li | Philadelphia\u2019s changing tastesIn New York\u2019s Chinatown, threats of displacement and economic insecurity also loom high. In 2021, the Museum of Chinese in America accepted a donation of $35 million in support of a borough-based jail complex which would displace Chinese American working-class people in the area. On top of that, its board executives were connected to the closing of the last unionized restaurant, beloved Jing Fong banquet hall, and construction of luxury towers that are actively raising rent and real estate taxes in the area.\nIn Philadelphia, the current 76Place project is being developed by 76 DevCo, an initiative by 76ers managing partners Josh Harris, David Blitzer, and David Adelman. Adelman is at the forefront of the construction of the arena and has promised not to displace the residents or businesses in Chinatown, but his past actions speak louder than his current words. Adelman works closely with Brett Altman, who also owns the University City Townhomes, and was a key figure behind the demolition and end of affordable housing in the West Philadelphia area that was previously known as the \"Black Bottom.\u201d This constant cycle of displacing residents and communities that have lived in the area for generations must end, and we must be the voice to make this happen.\n\tDevelopers of the project have stated that the arena will \u201cserve as a model for an equitable & inclusive community,\u201d yet there is not a single mention of Chinatown in the proposal. Efforts to ensure communities can benefit from this project read as empty promises when nearly 95% of residents, business owners, and visitors oppose the arena\u2019s construction.\nMany questions posed by residents have also gone unanswered by 76 DevCo. How will restaurants and small businesses in the surrounding area be protected? Who will clean the streets after huge events?\u00a0\nPreserving Philadelphia's architectural heritage demands careful consideration in urban development, but the development of the arena does the exact opposite \u2014 jeopardizing accessible low-income and senior housing complexes, healthcare clinics, and schools for children.\nPenn has direct ties to the developers in the area, and students should be cognizant of the situation. Adelman currently sits on Penn Medicine Board of Trustees and is the CEO of Campus Apartments, which houses many Penn students off-campus. But more importantly, Penn students are directly and indirectly involved in the Chinatown community, whether that be Penn Lions performing all throughout the city for Lunar New Year, or student groups like SPOC organizing initiatives to honor traditions celebrating the multi-ethnic communities that reside there.\u00a0\nDespite what greedy developers may suggest, Chinatown is not an ethnic theme park but a home. It\u2019s more than just a place to eat, it\u2019s a support network and a cultural hub for immigrants and visitors alike.\nIn the face of ongoing threats, Chinatown has demonstrated remarkable resilience and activism, advocating for the needs of all diverse communities of color that are integrated into the cultural fabric of our city. The next time you are in Chinatown, take a look around at all the place has to offer. Venture into Ebisu for some home decor and enjoy a Mochinut donut as you shop. Come by Dae Bak for soul-nourishing Korean barbecue. The opportunities to support your favorite restaurants and local businesses are endless.\nPlease don't turn a blind eye to what is happening outside the Penn bubble. Pay attention to what SPOC and other organizers are doing in the fight for the preservation of Chinatown. Educate yourself on what is going on in Chinatowns across the country. If you can, participate in programming like Crane Chinatown Community Center art exhibitions or Show Your Love for Chinatown events to learn more about the challenges facing the neighborhood. Sign petitions. \u00a0\nAdorned with dragon motifs, and gorgeous ornamental roof tiles, the Friendship Archway is not only an architectural masterpiece, but a labor of love \u2014\u00a0created for community by community. The engineers and artisans from Tianjin, China \u2014 Philadelphia\u2019s sister city \u2014 came together with residents and the city of Philadelphia to fund and invest in Chinatown, and you should too.\u00a0\nThe next time you walk through the gate, remember that the fight for Philadelphia\u2019s Chinatown, and Chinatowns everywhere, is not over. Speak up and fight for the movement so that history does not repeat itself.\nMore resources:\nGoFundMe for Ginger Arts Center\nAsian Arts Initiative\nGet our newsletter, DP Daybreak, delivered to your inbox every weekday morning.Youth Against Displacement\nLIALA SOFI is a College junior from Roanoke, Va.

          "title": "Caroline Magdolen | \u201cEveryone cheats.\u201d What can we do about it?",
          "article_content": "My guess is that nearly everyone reading this article knows someone who has been academically disingenuous, or been that someone before. Being academically dishonest isn\u2019t all about flashy examples, like the two admitted Penn students accused of plagiarism and fabricating data in 2022. There are smaller violations that may feel less egregious, or even harmless, like querying ChatGPT for help completing your homework, peeking at a friend\u2019s lab assignment, or answering a PollEverywhere as if you\u2019re in class, when really, you\u2019re snoozing in your dorm.\nAcademic dishonesty is having a moment in the spotlight. The advent of generative AI, the use of which cannot be reliably detected by grading softwares, will likely upend student learning for better or worse. At the same time, examples of plagiarism by prominent academics are being dug up left and right. The former president of Harvard, Claudine Gay, was ousted in part due to plagiarism concerns, and Business Insider found that former MIT professor Neri Oxman (the wife of billionaire Bill Ackman, who led the campaign against Gay) \u201cstole sentences and whole paragraphs from Wikipedia, other scholars and technical documents in her academic writing.\u201d\n\t\tTo be clear, I believe that academic dishonesty at Penn \u2014 going against community standards that your professor has explicitly outlined \u2014 is unacceptable, and that we should be doing more to penalize and prevent it.\nNevertheless, we must also acknowledge that academic dishonesty is understandable, in that we can piece together students\u2019 rationales when they do cheat, and even sympathize with them in some cases.\n\t\t\t\tSEE MORE FROM CAROLINE MAGDOLEN:\ufeffThe Rat Kings of PennThere\u2019s no better time for climate education\ufeffTo dissuade academic dishonesty, we employ sayings like, \u201cIt will only hurt you in the long run to cheat,\u201d or \u201cYou\u2019re taking advantage of other students who've completed their work fairly.\u201d This is true in some circumstances. If you\u2019re an aspiring quant and you\u2019re asking ChatGPT to calculate all of the derivatives on your MATH 1400 homework, it\u2019s going to show: First in your exams for the class, then in every math class you take thereafter, and especially in your future career. And if MATH 1400 is curved, your dishonest success capitalizes on the honest failures of others \u2014 not cool.\nBut this is not true in all cases. Jane* was a first year in her spring term when she was taking CIS 1210: Data Structures and Algorithms \u2014 a famously challenging CIS course \u2014 with Rajiv Gandhi, a famously challenging professor.\u00a0\n\tShe cheated on her coding assignment late into the semester, and as per the professor\u2019s policy, received a -300/100 on the submitted homework and zeros on all previously submitted homework, receiving a D as her final grade in the course.\nBut Jane believes that what is more important to her story is not what happened, but why it happened.\u00a0\n\u201cWhat drove me to make a bad decision? Why are [these classes] so infamous? It\u2019s because of notorious policies where you cannot collaborate on many assignments. You are given long problem sets to do, on your own, each week, with desperate students in office hour queues that are two to four hours long. Many times, you will go to the TA and not get a clear answer. It is a profoundly isolating situation, particularly for freshmen just entering college, and that\u2019s what drives well-meaning people to cheat.\u201d\nBased on my conversation with Jane, it seemed that she felt isolated at the time and was struggling to reach out for the support that she needed, both in CIS 1210 and at Penn as a whole. And given the limited support Jane could receive from TAs and her instructor, backtracking her friend\u2019s code felt more conducive to her learning than doing nothing.\nJane expressed a lot of remorse over what happened, and said that she still has a lot of respect for Rajiv, maintaining a good relationship with him to this day. She was also grateful that Rajiv was willing to handle this internally, since a low grade in the class looks better than a formal statement on her transcript, detailing her violation of academic integrity.\n\u201cI deserved to be punished harshly,\u201d Jane said. \u201cBut the collaboration policies of these introductory courses, and the punishment I received, wrecked my self-esteem and my early college experience. I felt that there was no way out.\u201d\nAccording to Jane, Rajiv's philosophy is to \"let go of your grades early: the sooner you stop caring about your GPA and start caring about learning, the better.\" She agrees with this philosophy, especially since he curves his courses generously, but sees this as out of touch with the realities of many Penn students.\nAfter students have prioritized perfecting their grades and resumes (and have been praised for it) in high school, those habits won\u2019t get undone overnight. Even at Penn, there are many institutions and accolades that continue to reward \u201cperfect\u201d performance over pursuing difficult academic disciplines, experimenting, and invariably messing up sometimes.\nFrankly, for a pre-med student in computer science (a track which Jane was considering at the time), the adage that \u201ccheating will hurt you in the long run\u201d skill-wise doesn\u2019t hold much water. The skillset of a future doctor and a software engineer just don\u2019t overlap enough. What can hurt a pre-med in the long run is a low GPA.\nAnd while there are some students for whom projects, internships, and technical interviews will get them a lot further in guaranteeing their success, this is not true for everyone. For many preprofessional students who may want to challenge themselves with a major or minor in CIS, they risk getting shut out of the study altogether.\nWhat frustrates me most about this entire situation is not that such harsh action was taken, but that it appears ineffective in tackling the issue at hand. If a student wanted to cheat, they could just take CIS 1600 or CIS 1210 during a different semester, when a different instructor was in charge and penalties were anecdotally known for being less harsh.\nWhile Jane\u2019s actions were clearly wrong, I can\u2019t help thinking that she was just the unlucky example that had to face the music, and she said as much in our interview: \u201cEveryone cheats in this class. You don\u2019t survive [CIS 1600 or CIS 1210] without talking to people, it just depends on whether you get caught. That doesn\u2019t make cheating okay, but it does mean that we need to rethink how these courses operate.\u201d\nSo, what can we do so that not everyone cheats?\nThis is a complex question, and there is no easy answer. It is crucial that as we frame the issue of academic integrity violations, we look at both the violations themselves and the root motivations that drive them \u2014 these actions are not taking place in a vacuum.\u00a0\nAcademic integrity violations these days are, to an extent, simply easier to commit. ChatGPT has led to a surge in \u201cunfair advantage\u201d violations. And even before generative AI, the pandemic had uprooted our usual test-taking environment. Now that classes are in person again, we no longer need to have take-home or open-Internet exams, but these still persist in some classes, and are easier to cheat on. Penn, given its history of fraudulent alumni, isn\u2019t going to be a place where professors can blindly trust students to refrain from cheating when presented with the option, so professors should take some responsibility for leveling the playing field in the classroom too.\u00a0\nJulie Nettleton, the executive director of Penn\u2019s Center for Community Standards and Accountability (CSA), relayed over email that CSA already works closely with schools and centralized resources at Penn to discuss how to proctor exams, and with faculty to discuss exams, syllabi language, and classroom policies.\nWhat constitutes a violation itself is currently not standard across classes, or even across different sections of the same class. How to handle a concern of academic integrity falls to the professor first \u2014 this is how Jane completed CIS 1210 with a lower grade, rather than a formal sanction from the CSA. It makes sense to delegate this responsibility to professors: It is more efficient than having the CSA handle every case, and professors should have the freedom to decide what constitutes cheating in their classrooms.\nHowever, this does open the door to students deliberately choosing sections of a course with professors that have more relaxed academic integrity policies. Conversely, some professors can be overly harsh, to the point where they are acting unfairly towards their students.\u00a0\nJill*, another student that I interviewed for this article, was falsely accused by her professor of collaborating on her final exam with her peers. At the start of winter break, the professor sent a class-wide email imploring those who worked together on the take-home exam to turn themselves in or have the matter escalated. Jill recalls that for students that turned themselves in, the professor lowered their grades accordingly \u2014 everyone else was reported to the CSA.\nIn the end, Jill\u2019s name was cleared, but she was assigned a case manager that seemed to have assumed she was guilty by default. As the case progressed, many of the details that the professor used to build the case against her appeared superfluous \u2014 for example, she and her friends had all rounded to the same decimal place in their work. Jill suspects that the escalation may have been personal: she had previously asked the professor, on behalf of the class, if he could make changes to his teaching style to facilitate learning.\nIt seems wrong to me that a professor could accuse a student and cause such extensive stress when in the end, Jill turned out to be innocent. It reminded me of some other methods that professors use to catch students cheating, such as Turnitin\u2019s flawed AI detector.\nPart of the solution to rampant academic dishonesty may also lie in expanding our vocabulary to discuss the issue, as John McWhorter pointed out in The New York Times. A class-wide cheating ring, direct plagiarism of original ideas from a paper as one\u2019s own, and copying a line of someone\u2019s code all constitute academic dishonesty, but range broadly in terms of severity and \u201cease of catching.\u201d However, this is rarely reflected in academic integrity policies.\u00a0\nIt can be awkward to suggest that some forms of dishonesty are worse than others, and more awkward still to draw the line between different punishments for different violations, but we must still have these conversations.\u00a0\nWhat should constitute dishonesty at all? When speaking with Jane, she would often circle back to how isolating it was to work alone on her assignments as a first year in introductory computer science courses, particularly as a woman in STEM. Every day, she would walk out of class \u201cfeeling way worse about [her]self.\u201d Now exploring chemistry, physics, and biology courses, she greatly appreciates the change in her academic environment, where students are encouraged to openly collaborate. The grade medians in chemistry are similar to those in CIS (which is to say, not great), but Jane is not as stressed as she was in CIS 1210, since she studies with her friends, and they can struggle and ask for help together.\u00a0\nWhile it was dishonest of Jane to copy code when it was against CIS 1210 policy, perhaps CIS majors and minors would learn more from the course if they were in a more collaborative environment to begin with. Jane has suggested that CIS 1210 should find a middle ground where students can learn from each other, but not be overly reliant on collaboration to perform well on exams.\u00a0\nShe also argues that there should be more opportunities for students to admit to academic dishonesty \u2014 through a friend at Stanford, she heard that at the end of a computer science class, students can select the assignments they have cheated on and receive a negative score on them, or risk facing more uncertain penalties if they are later caught.\u00a0\n\u201cThis policy gives people a second chance to do the right thing, and I do believe that you learn from an experience if you own up to it,\u201d Jane said.\nDeliberations over how best to address academic dishonesty can go on without end, but unfortunately this column must do just that.

          "title": "Jack Lakis | What we can learn from Penn\u2019s college ranking",
          "article_content": "Last fall, a plethora of new results from U.S. News & World Report, Wall Street Journal, and Forbes elevated Penn in their national college rankings. Nearly every list places Penn among the top 10, some going as far as placing the University among the top five. This universal growth resulted from a key change in most of these sources\u2019 metrics: greater consideration given to postgraduate salaries.\nPenn famously has one of the highest-earning alumni bodies in the country. Starting salaries for Penn graduates are often considered the highest in the Ivy League. By mid-career, the average Penn alum is raking in $165,000 annually, while the national average for a college graduate caps out at $74,000.\n\t\tPenn draws a great deal of prestige from its potential to produce high earners, which is a direct result of our school\u2019s preprofessional culture. Nearly 50% of all Penn graduates enter one of two career fields: consulting or finance. This pipeline allows most Penn alumni to matriculate into high-paying jobs shortly after graduation.\nI\u2019m usually a defender of preprofessionalism. It\u2019s crucial that Penn graduates are able to find good jobs, and high salary potential is an immense advantage. But those jobs aren\u2019t everything. Many universities are making gains in rankings and name recognition based on alumni outcomes in public service careers.\n\t\t\t\t\ufeffSEE MORE FROM JACK LAKIS:\ufeffDo we all hate Penn?Staying focused after Magill's resignation\ufeffFor example, Harvard University boasts about its eight presidential alumni. However, when 1968 Wharton graduate Donald Trump was elected president, Penn mostly ignored his history with the school. Given his proximity to controversy and his unconventional political history, Penn\u2019s bump in prestige was limited by Trump\u2019s election. Our second closest claim to the White House is the University\u2019s relationship with President Joe Biden and the opening of the Penn Biden Center. I argue that this is as far as Penn\u2019s ties to the presidency will go. Nowadays, Penn\u2019s laser focus on professional development might repel students who will one day have presidential potential.\nComparable institutions to Penn have high-earning graduates and prestigious placements throughout the government, nonprofit sector, and the advocacy space. For example, Georgetown University feeds graduates into congressional offices and many Fulbright programs. Princeton University also regularly features its flashy roster of graduates in powerful political offices. These universities maintain a strong presence in the private sector but are also actively represented in government positions.\n\tIn these examples, the institution itself sponsors an undergraduate school dedicated to public service. At Georgetown, it\u2019s the School of Foreign Service, while at Princeton the role is filled by the School of Public and International Affairs.\nI propose that Penn follow suit and create a fifth undergraduate school dedicated to public affairs. This new school could absorb Penn\u2019s wildly popular social science programs, like PPE (Philosophy, Politics and Economics), Political Science, and Economics. Currently, most students in these majors are scooped up by consulting firms and investment banks. If these students were given an intentional focus on service and social responsibility, perhaps they could feel empowered to use their degrees in a more meaningful way.\nThe least Penn can do is expand its current effort to bridge the gap between social science degree seekers and careers in government and nonprofits. It\u2019s crucial that our student body actively engages with the robust policy infrastructure that Penn has already made available: Civic House, Perry World House, opportunities like Penn in Washington, and extracurricular engagements offered by the Government and Politics Association. From what I\u2019ve seen, these resources are underutilized at Penn. By snubbing them, Penn students are working against the general interests of the University to gain prestige.\n\t\tGet our newsletter, DP Daybreak, delivered to your inbox every weekday morning.Besides, it's about more than just rankings. We have the potential to empower our students to become leaders in society. TIME Magazine ranks Penn as the third-best college for aspiring leaders. However, the article states its rationale for this placement as a concentration of graduates in business careers. Other chart-topping schools on this list were noted for their programs in law, medicine, and more.\nUltimately, private sector homogeneity marks one of Penn\u2019s key weaknesses. As we move forward, Penn has a duty to educate leaders in more than one field. If Penn strengthened its programs in civic engagement, more graduates would be inclined to pursue roles in government and could elevate Penn\u2019s cultural stature. We should be known for more than salaries. We can do more than business.\nJACK LAKIS is a College first year studying political science from Kennesaw, Ga.

          "title": "Mia Vesely | Black Penn is vibrant this month and every month",
          "article_content": "As of late, most of my columns have focused on things I take issue with: Whether it\u2019s Liz Magill\u2019s resignation and the threats to free speech on campus, or the lack of racial diversity in Panhellenic sororities. I haven't highlighted the things that I truly appreciate and, more specifically, the places in which I\u2019ve found community at Penn.\nLast February, I argued that Black history is important for everyone. Education surrounding Black people, their lives, and their contributions should be integrated into the standard curriculum. Black Penn shows up and shows out every month, but this month in particular, there are many events and ways that Penn student organizations uplift the community and come together.\u00a0\n\t\tIt would be impossible to touch on all of these amazing events and their impacts, but I\u2019d like to paint a picture of some of these groups and their initiatives during this month and beyond. Planning for these events takes months. For example, when Descendants of Afro-Americans at Penn (DAAP) \u2014 a club founded just last year \u2014 put on their first-ever gala on Feb. 1 to kick off the month, you better believe that the event was well-planned and executed.\u00a0\nThe gala \u2014 Red Carpet For A Cause \u2014 supported the Sickle Cell Disease Association of America's Philadelphia and Delaware Valley Chapter. The night included catered food, live performances from student groups like The Inspiration, wonderful community, and beautiful decor\u2014even including an ice sculpture of the DAAP logo. Over $1,700 was raised in support of the foundation.\n\t\t\t\tSEE MORE FROM MIA VESELY:\ufeffI dropped sorority rush and I\u2019m gladFirst Liz Magill, next free speechWhen asked about the impacts of the event, College sophomore and DAAP founding member Clarke Dickens said, \u201cWe wanted to bring the community together for a great cause, especially a cause that affects a lot of African Americans and Black people more broadly.\u201d\nSickle cell disease occurs in about one in every 365 Black babies born in the United States. The percentage of Black people who carry the trait is even higher, with one in 13 Black babies being born as carriers.\n\tDickens is not just involved with DAAP, but is also on the boards for QBlack and Shea Collective.\nThese clubs are all part of something commonly dubbed \u201cBlack Penn,\u201d which focuses on so many different aspects of identity. From cultural organizations like Penn African Student Association (PASA), to preprofessional organizations like Black Wharton and the Black Pre-Law Association (BPLA), to community service organizations like the NAACP, all of these organizations put an emphasis on service both inside the Penn community and out.\u00a0\nFor example, Campus Curlz \u2014 a club I serve on the board of \u2014 is, at first glance, a club centered around uplifting natural hair and embracing positivity. \u00a0But underlying hair mask making events and movie nights, there is a strong commitment to service. Just this month, the community service committee held an event where we made Valentine\u2019s Day cards for senior citizens at Mercy Life West Philadelphia.\nService by board members is a requirement to be part of funding organizations like UMOJA \u2014 the umbrella funding organization for Black clubs \u2014 and even beyond that, many clubs center service in every activity they partake in. Whether you\u2019re on the board of a club or not, there are many service opportunities available and encouraged.\nWhen asked what they wish people knew about Black Penn, Dickens said, \u201cClubs should make an effort to include grad students, it makes all the difference. I\u2019m able to say, \u2018This is what I would look like coming here for grad school,\u2019 and it can even offer opportunities for mentorship.\u201d\nWhat seems to drive Black Penn is first and foremost the students, then the supportive and involved faculty, as well as the local partnerships and opportunities the clubs find, build, and pursue for themselves. Many members of the DAAP board are native to Philadelphia, so that makes their work even more personal.\nWhile Black students do take initiative to realize what they need and create the spaces they want to see, there is so much room for improvement on behalf of Penn: whether it\u2019s stratifying the way funding is given to these clubs \u2014 they often can\u2019t fund silverware in UMOJA meetings if it can be provided elsewhere \u2014 or improving the cultural spaces available to students (we were promised the ARCH \u2018building,\u2019 not the ARCH \u2018basement\u2019). In months like February, Penn aims to spotlight their Black students. I just wish this recognition of the incredible community Black students forged for themselves, when they initially didn\u2019t see it on campus, came year-round.\n\t\tGet our newsletter, DP Daybreak, delivered to your inbox every weekday morning.Events like DAAP's gala happen every month, and it\u2019s important not to understate the role these organizations play in making Penn a welcoming and accepting place for students from marginalized backgrounds.\nI was happy to see Faces of Black Penn \u2014 a Black-run publication \u2014 highlighted in the DP last week. I hope people continue to uplift the work of these student groups going forward and make space to give all students their roses.

          "title": "Bernadine Kumi | I joined a sorority and I\u2019m glad",
          "article_content": "I\u2019ll be honest: I was not a fan of Greek life when I first got to Penn. My perception of Greek life was influenced by growing up in the South, mainly in suburban Georgia. This included a sorority scene of girls with fake spray tans and little to no personality. The images of sorority girls from the University of Georgia and Alabama screamed no diversity, which made me wary of joining a sorority at Penn. Being a First-Generation, Low-Income (FGLI) student made me especially hesitant. Even more so, coming from a Ghanaian household, the notion of a sorority was immediately dismissed as something against our Christian values. Thus, during my first year, I knew I would never, and I mean never, join a sorority.\u00a0\nHowever, by the beginning of sophomore year, my mindset began to change. After a year on campus, I had found a solid community of a small group of friends. But beyond that, I felt that I did not really know anyone. I couldn\u2019t name more than 20 people in my grade. Penn is known for being a networking school, and the \u201cSocial Ivy,\u201d so I began to question just how much I had taken advantage of that. That, along with most of the underclassmen party scene revolving around fraternities, made the idea of rushing even more appealing.\u00a0\n\t\tSo while most people were beginning their sophomore year with the friends they already had, I began to look for additional friends. My twin sister, who also goes to Penn, and I began attending open rush events, talking to sophomores in sororities, and involving ourselves in more social events. Over the next few months, my days consisted of talking to many girls, going to dinners, and putting myself out there in a way that I had been hesitant to do before. I made new friends, met fellow sophomores also in search of a bigger community, and found myself loving the idea of joining a sorority.\u00a0\nBut what made me even more eager was just how inclusive and diverse sororities were at Penn, more so than I had been expecting\u2014especially the off-campus sorority I ended up joining, OAX. I was still wary about rushing, but as soon as I got to the first event, I immediately felt comfortable. There were girls with different interests, passions, economic backgrounds, and personalities. Not a single conversation felt forced. Every girl I met had a unique and authentic story, and I felt like I could talk to them for hours.\n\t\t\t\tSEE MORE FROM BERNADINE KUMI:\ufeffDining hall workers at Penn Hillel demand better treatment from UniversityI was especially captivated by BLOAX (Black OAX), a community within OAX that includes fellow girls of Ghanaian descent and other Black girls who provided me with guidance on navigating Penn as a Black woman. OAX also has other smaller communities, such as LatinOAX and RainbOAX. Being able to find other people with similar backgrounds made the choice to join a sorority that much easier.\u00a0\nAs a FGLI student and Questbridge scholar, the idea of paying high dues out of my minimal work paychecks every month was unfathomable. I knew that joining a sorority would pose another financial burden, and even though I was loving the OAX community, the idea of paying dues scared me. Yet once again, OAX and other sororities surprised me with their understanding and financial transparency. They worked with me to develop an affordable monthly payment plan so that I, like every other girl interested in rushing, could also enjoy being in a sorority.\u00a0\n\tSince the morning of Bid Day when I got \u201cthe call,\u201d I know that I truly made the right decision by joining a sorority, for not only my social life but my professional life too. This past fall, I was able to land a summer internship in Los Angeles with the help of my grand-big. I was also able to prepare for my interview with girls in my sorority, who gave me the confidence I needed to land the opportunity. As a Black woman and FGLI student, I have truly benefited from joining Greek life. I hope students who are hesitant to rush, just as I once was, will see my experience and how transformative it can be. I hope others \u2014 whether they are Black women, FGLI students, or just Penn students in search of a greater community \u2014 can do the same.\nBERNADINE KUMI is a College junior studying political science and legal studies and history from Roswell, Ga.

          "article_content": "Columnist Jessey Shin explores the problem of disparate advising quality in the College and argues \nfor a more standardized experience.\u201cMy advisor lied to me?\u201d\nI remember someone saying this to me in complete disbelief, but I can\u2019t say I\u2019m surprised. Advisors can be as misleading as they are helpful, and this is a widespread problem that needs addressing.\n\t\tIn the College, students typically have between 15 and 20 credits outside of their primary major to meet the graduation requirement. These are used to fulfill general education requirements, pursue a second major or minor, or take elective courses that align with a student\u2019s interests.\nThe freedom to pursue one\u2019s intellectual pursuits is, of course, one of the draws of the College. I am looking to pursue two majors myself, in somewhat interconnected but disparate fields of study: the flexibility offered by the curriculum allows me to explore these interests without taking an obscene number of classes.\n\t\t\t\tSEE MORE FROM JESSEY SHIN:Making a case for the less popular college housesNavigating the maze of Penn's resources\ufeffThe problem is few students go into their first year knowing which major they would like to pursue, much less exactly which courses to take.\u00a0\nThe College puts a lot of effort into informing incoming students about the curriculum and what they have to offer, such as through the Compass module on Canvas that gives a foray into some aspects of the College experience (something that other schools do not offer). However, the sheer number of options can be overwhelming, giving rise to a unique need for personalized, one-on-one guidance. This is where pre-major advisors come in.\u00a0\n\tPre-major advisors, assigned to each student before they start their first semester at Penn, are a vital resource for College students. They guide students through the course selection process, encouraging and helping them as they explore their various interests and eventually settle on a major.\nI can say that I have had a relatively good experience with my pre-major advisor. However, I also found that some of the advice offered was not fully applicable to my circumstance, because of the recent transition from Penn InTouch to Path@Penn.\nOther students, however, are not as lucky. I have heard stories about advisors making their students cry, spreading misinformation, jeopardizing their advisees\u2019 course registration, you name it.\nIn an interview, one student (who requested anonymity) shared that they have had trouble reaching their pre-major advisor from the get-go. College students must meet with their advisor one-on-one to get their course registration hold lifted; without this, they are not eligible to participate in advance registration. The student was only able to reach their advisor a day or so before the deadline and has continued to have trouble with availability.\nOf course, their pre-major advisor experience was less than ideal. \u201cHer guidance wasn\u2019t so much guidance as it was looking at the boxes and seeing if I checked them,\u201d they said. \u201cI don\u2019t think I would feel comfortable going to her for personal issues, such as which major to pursue or how to explore [some of my interests], because I don\u2019t think she would point me [in] the right direction.\u201d Instead, they had been utilizing their PennCAP advisor (available for FGLI students) for these concerns.\nOn the other hand, some students are able to form a positive relationship with their advisor and find that they are helpful in navigating their interests. Rishi Dadlani, a College first year, described his advisor as \u201cfriendly and helpful. He gave me his phone number and told me to contact him if I [had] any questions \u2026 If I saw him around campus, I would say hi, and he always sends us a beginning-of-semester email.\u201d\n\t\tGet our newsletter, DP Daybreak, delivered to your inbox every weekday morning.This disparity in advising quality means that some students are at a great disadvantage compared to others. While some advisors are able to \u201cpoint students in the right direction,\u201d helping them take the right step forward in their college experience, others fall short. Their advisees must navigate the complicated process of learning about the majors, gen-ed requirements, and figuring out (the surprisingly difficult) advance registration process on their own.\nWhen done right, the freedom of the College curriculum can allow students to truly delve into their academic interests and eventually settle on the right path for them. However, that process requires a lot of research and planning that is supposed to be aided by a pre-major advisor. For incoming first years who are unfamiliar with the landscape at Penn and underclassmen students, this disparity in advising quality poses a challenge. Penn must ensure that all students are able to best utilize the resources at their disposal, and the first place to start is with the guidance they receive.\nJESSEY SHIN is a College first-year studying sociology and communications from Seongnam-si, South Korea.

This month offers an opportunity to delve into the depths of history: exploring narratives that challenge, inspire, and provoke thought. In the spirit of true academic inquiry and in honor of this significant month, I wish to highlight a selection of works by Black authors whose perspectives might diverge from the more commonly embraced interpretations of Black history and culture.\n\t\tIn recommending these texts, my intention is not to endorse every opinion expressed by the authors, but to underscore the importance of engaging with a diversity of viewpoints. These authors challenge us to look beyond the prevailing orthodoxy and to question the narratives that have become commonplace within academic circles. They remind us that the Black American experience, like any aspect of human history, is richly diverse and complex.\nAs members of an academic community that prides itself on intellectual rigor and openness, it is our responsibility to explore a broad spectrum of perspectives, especially those that provoke debate and reflection.

          "article_content": "\u201cWelcome to Penn! You are the most diverse class we ever admitted!\u201d The convocation rhetoric makes you feel so special. Penn is diverse because a student comes from Wisconsin and another from Kazakhstan. One plays the flute, one plays squash. Never mind that all of them want to be bankers or consultants. I wish someone had told me that nearly every other person sitting at Convocation with me would end up in the funnel. That however diverse my first-year class was, my senior class would simply not be.\nAs a teaching assistant for Wharton\u2019s required \u201cBusiness and You\u201d leadership course, I mentor first years adjusting to college and exploring careers. Someone confessed, \u201cIf not banking, then what else could I possibly do?\u201d If the best business school in the world (U.S. News debates aside) makes you believe you only have one option from day one, the institution, culture, and entire system have fundamentally failed.\n\t\tOf course, there is nothing wrong with those jobs: The last thing we need is a trembling economic system and inefficient markets. The problem is blindly assuming that one in two employed Penn grads and 80% of Wharton grads woke up and consciously made such a decision. Unpacking our culture proves how little of a decision this is and how everything revolves around two words: prestige and control.\nIt is common knowledge by now that Penn students are privileged. However, you may not know that for every single student from the bottom 20%, over 21 people come from the top 20%, blithely offsetting their upbringing. The result? An abject elite detached from reality. Okay, perhaps this is cynical, but if we are known for our elitist \u201cseeing and being seen\u201d culture, is it a surprise that 25% of us are so disillusioned to think the average U.S. salary is above six figures? Of course not (both not surprising and not true).\n\t\t\t\tPenn\u2019s alarming lack of socioeconomic diversity (despite efforts acknowledged this) unequivocally creates a culture perpetuating the value of money at the expense of everything else. The people you sit next to in class distract you with their laptop screens: purchasing a Gucci bag or booking Airbnbs in Cancun. The emails you receive are about banking and consulting events. This is the model. The only one. The only one, right?\nLet\u2019s be honest, \u201cjust follow your passion\u201d won\u2019t pay the bills, and I cannot blame an indebted or underprivileged student for desiring financial freedom with a high-paying job. This is why I am not saying the Wall Street lifestyle is unethical, although like others, I could. I am saying this is only one way to live your life. One of infinitely many. Which one makes sense for YOU?\n\tEveryone at Penn is good at planning, several are good at doing, and almost none are good at reflecting. The purpose of your college education is not exclusively career preparation. If this is what they had you do, I hate to tell you that you have been robbed. As writer William Deresiewicz argues, \u201cWhat you should want to develop in college is the habit of reflection, which means the capacity for change because most of what you come across in college will inevitably fade from memory. What is left over, precisely, is you.\u201d A culture, even more so an institution, should give you the tools to understand what model of life you want to live, not impose the model on you.\nYet, my student's question is central and inevitable: What else if not banking?\nAsking yourself what truly energizes you is no easy task, because it requires the vulnerability to let go of the comforting lifetime certainty that the predetermined path gives you: 2025 summer recruiting, analyst, associate \u2026 Well, the desire to eliminate uncertainty eliminates life. What do you plan to do after \u201csome years of experience\u201d with your future free time and why on earth are you not doing it now?\nIn his book \u201cExcellent Sheep,\u201d Deresiewicz advocates for the importance of time off, slowing down, breaking the cycle of endless achievement, and acknowledging the existence of a world outside of your Ivy League. It may be scandalous to some and unmistakable to others, but what if you replaced your obsessive passion for finance with one that is harmonious, perhaps exploring capacities you have not had a chance to cultivate? What if you did something you purposefully cannot put on a resume or post on LinkedIn? Yes, you may be \u201cbehind\u201d those who doubtlessly persist in the hierarchy, but what is the purpose of being at the top if you are climbing the wrong mountain?\n\t\tGet our newsletter, DP Daybreak, delivered to your inbox every weekday morning.The main idea behind the Pathless Path is not to neglect the ambition that got us where we are (not even to stop using Path@Penn), but rather to remember that Penn is not a four-year treadmill to (and playground for) the American elite. Yes, it was founded for them, but Penn\u2019s core mission today is the pursuit, enhancement, and dissemination of knowledge. We need to be aware of and manage our bewitching instinct to desire control and the social need for status. The truth is you cannot eradicate control and prestige. Just stop watering them. Like the French say, \u201cl\u00e2cher prise.\u201d\nLiberal education puts everything at risk and requires you to risk everything. The process is by no means comfortable, but it is liberating and extraordinary. If it happens right, it feels like giving birth to yourself.

          "article_content": "Columnist Mariana Martinez describes her personal experiences with Penn's dining services.A text from my friend lit up my phone.\u00a0\n\u201cDude, you\u2019re literally getting the reverse Freshman 15!\u201d\n\t\t\u201cThe what?\u201d I replied.\nAs an international student, I had no idea that Freshman 15 was a thing. But by the time I found out what it was, it was already too late. My eating schedule became very irregular: I skipped meals thinking it was more practical for me. Because of Penn\u2019s poor dining services and few inclusive food options, my physical and mental health were severely affected by the end of my first semester.\u00a0\n\t\t\t\t\ufeffBefore coming to Penn, when people asked me what I would miss most from Colombia, I usually answered by saying I'd miss the food. But as my first semester flew by, I realized it went beyond missing my country\u2019s food and more into an overwhelming transition and violent adjustment to the American diet, characterized by fast-food consumption, takeout over-reliance, and a lack of fresh food. It made my transition to college even more overwhelming than it already was.\u00a0\nI never expected diet to pose the challenge it did during my first semester. I didn\u2019t expect my food options to narrow so suddenly. The differences between the American and other countries\u2019 diets cause international students to mess up their meal structure. In the midst of the American diet, breakfast becomes the least important meal, meal times become arbitrary, and late dinners are frequent.\u00a0\n\tI found myself skipping breakfast because I couldn\u2019t tolerate American breakfast foods: bacon, potatoes, sausage, casseroles. I stopped eating fruit, and I started eating only one large meal a day. At the same time, I was pushing myself to be my best in my classes, clubs, and job while running on very little fuel. By winter break, my body was pretty much destroyed.\nAs I asked other international students about their dining habits, I found that my experience was not an isolated one. Some of them told me that they \u201cjust don\u2019t know what to eat anymore.\u201d Others said that because of their international status, they had a limited budget to eat off-campus and that relying on Penn\u2019s terrible food was torturous.\u00a0\nSurveys have shown that as international students transition into their lives at American universities, many face dietary challenges and health consequences. For instance, many international students report a halt in their fruit and vegetable consumption because they believe the United States\u2019 options are not as fresh. Others report severe weight loss/gain and stomach issues from struggling to adapt to an American diet that consists mainly of meals large in sugars and fat.\u00a0\nBack in Colombia, I was used to having almost five meals a day. My diet included cereals and a variety of meats, vegetables, and fruits. Other international students also report being accustomed to multi-course meals, often characterized by a careful, homemade preparation. On the other hand, the American diet narrows down choices abruptly. International students describe their choices as pizza, salad, pasta, French fries, sandwiches, and chicken \u2014 which holds true to the quintessential Penn dining experience.\u00a0\n\t\tGet our newsletter, DP Daybreak, delivered to your inbox every weekday morning.Being thrown into a poor dietary environment has a significant impact on students\u2019 mental health. Many studies show that students with poor dietary conditions are more likely to suffer from depression and anxiety. The dietary conditions at Penn have impacted my emotional well-being: It is very frustrating to feel like I have no high-quality dining options. The strain on my wallet as I buy groceries and off-campus food is also stressful, considering around a third of Penn\u2019s international students are on financial aid.\u00a0\nThe international student experience with the food at Penn can only be described as aggravating. Not only is the American diet more unhealthy than food in international students\u2019 countries, but it also causes disruptions in meal structure and health. As a school that prides itself on being diverse, Penn should really focus on making the dining experience more accessible for its international students. Not to mention an improvement in the food would benefit the whole student body, given recent events. It is clear that this becomes a matter beyond just food: it\u2019s also about inclusivity, general well-being, and enjoying the college experience.\u00a0\nMARIANA MARTINEZ is a College first year studying English and classics from Bogot\u00e1, Colombia.

          "title": "Chapin Lenthall-Cleary | The Penn administration farcically mistreats new student clubs",
          "article_content": "Guest Columnist Chapin Lenthall-Cleary highlights the bureaucratic hurdles that face student organizations and clubs at Penn.It's no secret that many of the University's student clubs are brutally exclusive \u2014 often demanding prospective members submit applications and participate in interviews \u2014 only to bar most of them from participating anyway. It's no secret that this system of club exclusivity inflicts a variety of harms on students: It deprives them of opportunities to participate in academic, service, recreational, and other activities. It shuts them out of a significant avenue of making friends. It pits students against each other. It furthers a culture obsessed with credentials over learning (or whatever a club's mission might be). And, as if all of that weren't damaging enough, it wastes non-trivial amounts of students' limited time at the University.\u00a0\nIt's far less well known, however, that the University's administration \u2014 especially the Office of Student Affairs \u2014 imposes numerous stringent, farcical, and sometimes nearly insurmountable hurdles upon new, often open-membership clubs.\u00a0\n\t\tIn October 2022, I founded Penn Humans vs. Zombies (HvZ), a (then-unofficial) club that held live-action zombie apocalypse games with Nerf blasters in David Rittenhouse Laboratory. The games were open to everyone and attracted a range of undergraduates across various schools, plus graduate students, alumni, a few students from nearby schools, and occasionally a professor. We required no applications or interviews, even for club leadership positions, which were filled by those willing to do the extra work to help run the games. Against even the advice of some club officers, I refused to charge admission.\u00a0\nI don't want to oversell this: Lance or not, I wasn't killing any windmills. One silly game with an earnest mission, of course, wasn't fixing a broken system, nor was HvZ the only open-membership club at Penn. But HvZ was at least one example of something the University desperately needs and badly, though not completely, lacks places for Penn students to find community and friends with shared interests, free from demands to run a marathon in a rat race just for a chance at being let in the gate. In fact, my uncompromisingly open-membership policies are exactly what even OSA claims to want.\n\t\t\t\tSEE MORE FROM \ufeffOPINION:\ufeffEmily Chang | No Senator, not all Asians are ChineseKiyah Akins | How I have been shaped by Black historyAbout a year passed before I realized that our zombies weren\u2019t the most soulless people HvZ would have to face. Last fall, after hearing about HvZ, the building manager contacted me, demanded that I stop the games, and revoked my 24/7 access to DRL. I reluctantly agreed to stop holding the games in DRL, but I reached out to the director of OSA to appeal the decision, where I was met with a tsunami of bureaucracy and an instruction to stop the games until they gave approval. The process involved meetings between multiple members of OSA, public safety, risk management, and others. When I asked to be involved in these discussions, I received the canned reply, \"[OSA has] not traditionally included students at this stage of conversation.\"\u00a0\nIt took over a month to get permission from OSA to continue the games and about as long to sort out the actual process of getting a space. There was just one problem: OSA's Kafka-and-friends committee decided that HvZ had to occur in an athletic space. When I tried to rent such a space, I discovered that doing so would cost $75 an hour, or around $4,500 per semester for a four-hour game once a week, an impossible cost for our club. When I told the OSA director that having to pay this fee to continue our game would be as good as a death sentence for HvZ and asked for the fee to be waived or paid, I was told to go find funding. I'll say that again: We spent months waiting, only to be told that we needed to find a way to get the University to pay us thousands of dollars \u2014 that we'd use to pay Penn the fee they decided to charge us \u2014 to play a game that costs them nothing.\n\tI did everything the OSA director suggested and more to try to get funding. As it currently stands, we have only a small fraction of what we actually need. And, I'm not hopeful, because this isn't the first time I've tried to get funding for a club.\u00a0\nLast winter, I founded Drone Club, another open-membership club. This one was dedicated to building drones, and I was willing to teach less experienced students the electronics, soldering, physics, and skills involved in doing so. Initially, I paid largely out-of-pocket for parts, but this wasn't ideal or particularly sustainable, so I sought club funding. With significant effort and about a month's delay, we got $220, about half of what we requested, from the Common Funding Application, the very funding source the OSA director suggested we use to find thousands of dollars for HvZ. In fall 2023, in order to secure larger, more regular funding, I applied for SAC recognition, the primary avenue for regular club funding, for Drone Club.\u00a0\nDrone Club was rejected for the sole reason of not having been on the PennClubs website since Oct. 31, 2022 (yes, that\u2019s over a year before we applied, and it\u2019s different from the deadline listed on the SAC website). The stated reason for the requirement that inspired that rejection is that \"student groups must be sustainable,\" which requiring students to check a box a year in advance obviously does little to confirm. Indeed, as I noted in Drone Club's application, where I asked SAC \"not to reject us upon a technicality, and instead judge us upon our merits,\" Drone Club's mostly underclassman membership is an infinitely better metric for sustainability.\u00a0\nEven clubs that are accepted still aren't written into the SAC budget until the school year after applying. Combined together, these requirements mean that, even if nothing goes wrong, a new club takes years to receive SAC budget funding. Under the current system, a sophomore who started a club now would graduate before having a chance at seeing any SAC budget funding.\u00a0\nThe above is only a small fraction of the examples of Penn institutions' hostility towards new clubs: being denied tables at the activity fair, having Drone Club removed from the PennClubs website for not getting Engineering Student Activities Council recognition (which, according to the PennClubs website, isn't a requirement), and more. If you're shocked by the severity and regularity of this problem, keep in mind that these are only examples of the University's administration\u2019s hostility towards new, open-membership clubs that I run (and therefore know about), which are doubtlessly a tiny subset of the full problem.\u00a0\n\t\tGet our newsletter, DP Daybreak, delivered to your inbox every weekday morning.Despite this relentless onslaught, I still don't know how this story ends. There's still a scenario where a powerful administrator decides to put the welfare of students above rules and diktats, and says, \"Enough of this nonsense,\" and HvZ gets to return triumphantly to DRL, or at least to another good location, free from extortionate fees. There's still a scenario where Drone Club secures its funding for parts, and the many other clubs doubtlessly facing similar farcical obstacles are instead met with a well-lit road, not numerous Harnwell-and-a-half-high hurdles. Heck, there's still a scenario where OSA lives up to its stated ideals and starts staunchly supporting open-membership clubs and exerting real force to get closed-membership clubs to open up.\u00a0\nThis hasn't been a happy story, and I'm frankly not betting on that changing. Nor, sadly, would a single exception for HvZ solve this massive harm to students, thrilled though I\u2019d be to get such an exception. But this story isn\u2019t over yet. If enough people, or even one person with enough power, decide to end this farce today and decide that doing right by students must always come first, there could yet be not only a happy ending to HvZ's struggle but also a bright future for all open-membership clubs at the University. To the administrators who\u2019ve caused this damage and to those who have the power to fix it, shape up.\nCHAPIN LENTHALL-CLEARY is a College senior studying physics and philosophy from Radnor, Pa.

          "article_content": "This semester, I somehow ended up with four out of my five classes being either directly or indirectly about ethics. As a political science major, I was really excited to take these classes, since whenever people talk about ethics nowadays, it mostly has to do with politics or international relations.\nAt a time when our reality changes so rapidly because of technology, and when we are faced with a number of global challenges, some people have forgotten about the importance of acting morally. Especially at a place like Penn, where everyone seems to be extremely worried about their future and their careers, people often disregard these values when they are caught up by the competitive environment. Because of this, one would think that ethics classes would be extremely beneficial for all, but do they actually contribute to making students more ethical individuals?\n\t\tAccording to my professors, they don\u2019t.\nIn all four ethics classes, my professors started the semester by telling us that ethics classes will not make most of us more ethical. I sat there, listening to all of them, and I just could not understand why they would say something like that. If I wasn\u2019t going to learn anything, what was the point of taking these classes?\n\t\t\t\tSEE MORE FROM ZARA TENA:The urgent need for younger voices in politics\ufeffIt\u2019s okay to be ordinaryThat\u2019s where I was wrong: I have been learning a lot.

By taking these classes, I might not become a better person, but they have given me a space where I can explore, discuss, and reflect about where I stand on so many issues and what my beliefs about morality actually are.\nEthics is not a subject that can be forcefully taught through lectures and readings. There is no way that we can sit down for three hours every week and magically become more ethical just because we memorize theories and read long papers written by old white men. The goal of these classes is not to tell us what is \u2018right\u2019 or \u2018wrong,\u2019 \u00a0but to give us the skills to navigate the gray areas in ethical decision making.\n\tThese classes encourage self reflection and personal growth. Even when analyzing big case studies or exploring different theories, students are pushed to question their own values, beliefs, and biases. While this may not guarantee that we will completely transform our moral compasses, the self awareness that comes from these reflections creates a great foundation for understanding why we act the way we do and also invites us to try to understand others.\nThe fact that ethics classes begin with a warning \u2014 that you won\u2019t become more ethical by taking them \u2014 should not stop anyone from giving them a chance. The ability to think critically, understand different values and perspectives, and have the skills to self reflect are essential parts of any college education. They prepare students for the complicated moral dilemmas they might face in their personal and professional lives \u2014 especially when most people at Penn will end up with jobs that are notorious for their ethical scandals!\nZARA TENA is a College sophomore studying political science from Puebla, Mexico.

          "article_content": "How many times have you found yourself in a never-ending cycle of back-and-forth messages, trying to pin down a date for a long overdue catch up with a friend? Every get together begins to feel as if it requires intricate planning and strips away the simplicity of social connection. This routine becomes stifling, lacking spontaneity and authenticity; you\u2019re constrained to coordinating with the same faces in the same places.\u00a0\nThis is what I like to call scheduling fatigue.\u00a0\n\t\tAs a result of this phenomenon, gatherings among friends are beginning to resemble scheduled business meetings, meticulously arranged via tools like When2Meet or synchronized Google Calendars.\nWhile resorting to scheduling may seem like the only viable option to maintain a semblance of social connection, perhaps it's time to embrace the idea of venturing out solo: I\u2019m challenging you to go on an unplanned side quest all by yourself to a third place.\u00a0\n\t\t\t\tMORE FROM LALA MUSTAFA:A nation on defense: Dismantling misinformation against Azerbaijan in the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict\ufeff\ufeffAllow me to explain. Picture the first place as your home and the second as your place of education or work. Now, the third place emerges as a public sphere where individuals congregate, not out of any obligation like in the previously mentioned locations, but, for lack of a more precise term, to simply vibe. It could be the cozy corner of a cafe, a communal park, or even the neighborhood barbershop \u2014 anywhere that\u2019ll allow you to interact with people outside your usual circles.\u00a0\nYet, at many universities like Penn, the concept of a third place seems all but lost as our lives remain restricted to school grounds, causing even our first and second places to converge into one. While spots on campus \u2014 like Stommons, Pret, or the cultural centers in ARCH \u2014 can offer some respite, they often come with the latent pressure of being on the clock. Conversations here revolve around assignments, internships, and the intricacies of Penn culture. The chances of an unexpected encounter dwindle given that most people in attendance will be other Penn students. As we\u2019re cocooned in the Penn bubble, it comes as no surprise that many students spend their four years in Philadelphia without ever fully exploring it.\u00a0\n\tYet, this insulation comes at a cost that extends far beyond what we realize.\u00a0\nIt severs our connection not only from the outside world but also from ourselves. That is, within such limits, our individuality dwindles, reducing us to mere roles influenced by our peers. By excluding ourselves from a wider social sphere, we inhibit opportunities to engage with diverse perspectives, trap ourselves in a cycle of familiarity, and risk leading monotonous lives that pave the way to burnout.\nHowever, in our lives, both intimacy and affiliation with broader communities are essential. While intimacy often stems from our immediate circles, affiliation thrives in third places where spontaneous interactions occur. These spaces facilitate easy contact with new individuals on a regular basis, without the need for prior scheduling. As they consistently offer an opportunity for interaction with others, they end up cultivating the most reliable form of socialization.\u00a0\nSo, if you are keen on exploring new horizons and getting involved in the Philadelphia community, I suggest checking out the many informative articles dedicated to bursting the Penn bubble.\nNevertheless, I want to avoid confining third places to physical locations. They\u2019re more of a mindset, a willingness to embrace spontaneity wherever it may arise. They don't have to be far from campus or require spending money. Instead, third places can be any informal spots you visit \u2014 whether it's your student lounge, the library, or a community center.\u00a0\n\t\tGet our newsletter, DP Daybreak, delivered to your inbox every weekday morning.We often find ourselves caught up in the routines of daily life, clinging to familiar patterns of scheduling and social interaction.

          "title": "Beatriz B\u00e1ez | No closed captioning available",
          "article_content": "Columnist Beatriz B\u00e1ez explains her experience with language fatigue at Penn.On my first day at Penn, I called my father in distress, telling him I needed to move back home and study there as I was going to die alone at this university. My father asked why, and I quickly responded, \u201cI haven\u2019t met anybody in three hours. I have no friends. It\u2019s over for me.\u201d\u00a0\nThat very same night, I went to a New Student Orientation event at Houston Hall. As I nervously paced the floor in my Crocs, I overheard some students speaking Spanish and immediately gravitated toward them. Confessing, \u201cI heard Spanish, and I feel saved,\u201d I ended up meeting three genuine individuals, all from various parts of Latin America. Having arrived in the United States, it felt comforting to hear voices that reminded me of home. This comfort is priceless in such a foreign environment.\n\t\tAll my life, I\u2019ve taken courses in Spanish, spoken Spanish at home, and been berated by my grandmother whenever I spoke too much English. Arriving at Penn, I didn\u2019t anticipate the struggle I would face taking classes taught in English, as I had been lucky enough to have been extensively taught English from a very young age.\nBut speaking in a second language most of the time, even as a fluent speaker, is incredibly draining. Meeting native Spanish speakers at Penn was truly a blessing. However, I have found that some people react adversely to me speaking my primary language. These are not continuous reactions of a high degree, but there have been enough small instances to mark me.\u00a0\n\t\t\t\tMORE ON THIS TOPIC:Students celebrate 40th annual Festival Latinx, honoring Latinx culture on campusLa Casa Latina celebrates 2023 Latinx Heritage Month at PennOn various occasions, I have had Latinx friends say, \u201cLet\u2019s speak English so X person doesn\u2019t feel excluded,\u201d or even resort to English for \u201cconvenience\u201d when we\u2019re alone. For the former, I understand the sentiment. I wouldn\u2019t want someone to be excluded from a conversation in such a way. However, when I\u2019m naturally speaking Spanish, having my speech interpreted as a personal offense is off-putting.\u00a0\nIn one instance, I met a student through a mutual friend on a night out. This friend and I speak fluent Spanish; the person I had just met did not. Throughout the night, I had various conversations with my new acquaintance \u2014 who I found quite amicable \u2014 and my friend. I would naturally speak Spanish with the latter, not thinking much of it. The next morning, my friend told me how the new acquaintance felt I hated them for speaking Spanish in front of them, knowing they didn\u2019t speak the language.\u00a0\n\tI was shocked by the assumption and, in all honesty, a little offended. I found it quite conceited that one would think another person is speaking in their first language to actively exclude them. Speaking in a first language, for me, is purely a relief issue. Although I am fluent in English, after an entire week of speaking it, it can be extremely draining; thus, particularly in a social setting, I don\u2019t want to add to the exhaustion.\u00a0\nIt is more than fine to be curious about what somebody is saying and ask for a translation. However, immediately expressing discomfort upon hearing another language and presuming the other person is talking badly about you is inconsiderate toward them. More often than not, this language switch is for comfort. This was the first of sufficient instances that exposed a pattern in my time at Penn. In another class, I grew close to a few other Spanish-speaking students. One of them continuously suggested we switch back to English for seemingly no valid reason and would reply to any comment of mine in English.\u00a0\nThis harsh reality on campus expands into the club scene. In one instance, a native English speaker attended a club meeting primarily led in Spanish. Within this meeting, if club members asked questions in Spanish, any other members who answered quickly switched to English. Evidently, the intent is to have everybody be able to partake in conversation. However, members within a Spanish-led group should be able to detach from English formalities within club meetings, particularly if the club seeks to embrace Latinx heritage.\u00a0\nSpeaking in my primary language is the greatest manifestation of my culture, particularly since Spanish accents are so diverse throughout Latin America. Having to switch to English not only in academic settings but in seemingly every other sphere of Penn life further disconnects me from the culture I\u2019ve been surrounded by my entire life until now. This applies to any person whose main language isn\u2019t English, not only to Spanish speakers.\u00a0\n\t\tGet our newsletter, DP Daybreak, delivered to your inbox every weekday morning.Penn has students from over 100 countries, with around 19% of the student body being international. If one truly wants to immerse themselves in Penn\u2019s multilingual community, one needs to recognize that a language barrier works both ways. Just as an English speaker may be tired from learning another language, a non-English speaker can be drained from constantly speaking English. It\u2019s crucial to recognize that for the latter, multilingualism surpasses a simple language requirement and spills over to nearly every sector of their life at Penn.\u00a0\nLanguage fatigue is a true reality, especially for individuals who haven\u2019t learned English from a young age. Thus, if somebody within your social group is speaking their first language, which you are not fluent in, it does not give you the right to feel offended or urge them to speak in a tongue you understand. And, if you are a non-native English speaker, as much as you can, \"habla en tu primer idioma y que los dem\u00e1s se ubiquen.\"\nBEATRIZ B\u00c1EZ is a College first year studying mathematics and political science from San Juan, Puerto Rico.

And, if white is a moral choice, there is an enormous challenge: then you're challenging an entire civilization,\u201d said James Baldwin.\nWhiteness is the myth we\u2019ve been sold and under which we live. In our instruction at the University of Pennsylvania, we were told to reach for safety and to secure our decadence. So are the students now, but they are not nearly as certain that this is the road they\u2019d really like to walk. The students I knew have already paid that price for that ticket, and their horizons, on a human level, look bleak.\u00a0\n\t\tPhiladelphia is not a college town. It is a real city, a Black city, a poor city whose reality reflects the depth of the American crisis and yet contains the possibilities of its salvation. From the soil of this city rose heroes like Teddy Pendergrass, The Delfonics, McCoy Tyner, and Alfie Pollitt. A friend, then a nursing student who had packed her bags for New York City after graduation and returned a few years later to work in the hospitals, remarked on her return, \"Philadelphia has soul.\"\u00a0\nIn the five years since I\u2019ve graduated, the tone of campus has shifted. Students are developing a new language in order to deal with existential questions: What is the purpose of education and the responsibility of students in the wake of war? More than in my time, it is now clear that we, the students, want to be free. The crisis is deepening, and history is accelerating.\n\t\t\n\t\nFewer illusions are possible for the young mind in Philadelphia, which tempers and sharpens it like metal on metal. What the path to whiteness and an invented safety then produces is a delusional and unfree state. My peers, who are banking, coding, and consulting their lives away, are living as prisoners to the choices they\u2019ve made.\u00a0\nAll the beauty, genius, and potential I witnessed when we were young together, freshman year before the vicious teeth of Penn successfully \u201csocialized\u201d most of us, has been wasted, whittled down into dust, and lost. My old friends might have money, but they didn\u2019t manage to save their souls, and some part of them knows this fact \u2014 that they are perishing. We were never meant to become the fools and tools of the mythic America: the one that is superior, war-hungry, greedy, and hypocritical. These choices did their damage. That was an aberration. Now, we are entering a time of correction.\u00a0\n\tWe want to know the meaning of our lives when we live in a country whose hand assassinates a man and poet as beautiful and courageous as Refaat Alareer, when we live in a society in which Aaron Bushnell had to die so that humanity could live. When the youngest students of Philadelphia stand to say they are no different from the children of Palestine, that the bombs dropped abroad also explode in our neighborhoods, we then know it is true for ourselves \u2014 that we bleed the same as these children in Palestine, as all the men and women we encounter in Philadelphia.\u00a0\nOur bondage to the genocide in Gaza is through the struggle to become moral human beings in America, and to relinquish our country from the myths that strangle us and our people.\u00a0\nIt is unmistakable that the education Penn offers is bankrupt, and that some cancer, invisible but detectable, poisons our relationships to each other and to ourselves. The scramble for acceptance into mediocre clubs and fraternities is insufferable, and the false authority these groups stand on in order to make these judgments is embarrassing.

To investigate and challenge the standards of their education, peers, and professors. And to then act and live by these new definitions, through which we will discover freedom. The world makes us, and we make it, too.\u00a0\nIf we were meant to become the leaders of this country and makers of history, as so many of us have been told from youth into maturity \u2014 that we are capable of this \u2014 then this is our role to fulfill: a brave, original, and purposeful life that skirts the frontier of new standards for this nation.

          "title": "Hanadi Abdulkadir | How poor dining hall food shapes our mental and academic capabilities",
          "article_content": "At this point, many Penn students have lived the terrible dining stories at a number of halls across campus. While it\u2019s important to discuss the health and sanitary risks associated with some of these concerns, it\u2019s also necessary to break down how this problem factors into students\u2019 academic and mental well-being.\u00a0\nOpening Sidechat every few days to see yet another picture of undercooked meat or hearing horror stories from my friends dissuades me from trekking across campus to eat at many of our dining halls. Oftentimes, I find myself skipping meals or stretching the time out between each one \u2014 until I accept the fact that I\u2019ll be eating the same food I already ate a couple times that week. Does this mean that I\u2019m probably missing out on some of the necessary vitamins or fiber I should be getting daily? Probably.\n\t\tNumerous Penn Dining Wellness emails live in our inboxes with tips on improving digestive health and practicing better healthy habits in our daily lives. Additionally, the official page for Penn Dining boasts awards and recognitions for sustainability and top college dining. However, the pristine and glossy promotional pictures of sandwiches, smoothies, and breakfast bowls tell a completely different story from the reality on campus.\nWith two of the most historical repeat offenders \u2014 Hill House and 1920 Commons \u2014 being the only consistent options available for on campus dining during the weekend, it\u2019s much more convenient to resort to the other retail spots scattered around campus. However, some of these locations are far apart, depending on where you live, and can add additional costs to weekly expenses. \u00a0\n\t\t\t\tSEE MORE FROM HANADI ABDULKADIR:\ufeffPenn should require an African American history courseWhy social media and Palestinian activism goes hand in handAdditionally, for students who are dishing out a hefty sum of money to enroll in the dining plan, going out of their way to seek expensive alternatives takes away money that could\u2019ve been better spent elsewhere. Considering that first years and sophomores are required to pick a dining plan for their first two years at Penn, it\u2019s no wonder that students have consistently called for the food standards to match the high prices of these meal swipes. Ideally, no student should feel like they need to resort to options outside of Penn; rather, outside options should be supplemental to an already quality level of options at all dining halls.\u00a0\nSince coming to Penn, my relationship with food has become much more complex. I need to look twice when picking out a seemingly clean utensil to eat whatever is on my plate or stare extra hard at my salad with suspicion before consuming it. But growing up, food was always a way for me to connect with my family and friends, to bring us back together even when we hadn\u2019t seen each other in a long time. Yet the food at Penn, at its worst, has left me frustrated and succeeded at suppressing my appetite \u2014 something I actually can relate to other students about.\n\tAlthough certain foods are scientifically linked to improving mental clarity and focus, I hesitate in reaching for those vegetables because they don\u2019t look as fresh or appetizing when lined up on display in Kings Court English House. As a result, I look for short-term solutions in coffee, which leaves me feeling tired earlier in the day or exhausted while trying to tackle my assignments at night. In order to meet my immediate deadlines, I prioritize some assignments over others, meaning some classes suffer in academic performance and perpetuate an almost never-ending cycle of playing catch-up. I believe that the root cause of all these problems can be traced back to the lack of decent dining.\u00a0\nThis same sentiment has been echoed by many of my friends and peers. But the dining quality at Penn can be mitigated if the University addresses the root problem. Whether that be promoting clean and sanitary workspaces when handling food or streamlining student complaints to Penn Dining other than through email, the University can restore student faith in the system. When it comes to campus dining, Penn can improve upon our experiences by implementing the changes that students deserve to enjoy, especially at the height of midterm season.\nHANADI ABDULKADIR is a College sophomore studying international relations from Philadelphia.

          "article_content": "During Penn\u2019s recent administrative upheaval, the University community found an unexpected silver lining: For the first time, Penn was making headlines alongside Harvard and MIT.\u00a0\nThe presidents of these three institutions were at the center of an infamous congressional hearing in December after their alleged missteps on campus antisemitism. I\u2019ll admit, there is something far more distasteful about chaos at the Capitol than the collective HYPSM prestige.\n\t\tBut many of us are taking our education at Penn for granted, shedding our \u201cque ser\u00e1, ser\u00e1\u201d optimism, and wondering at times what it would be like to go to a more recognizable Ivy. For decades, we\u2019ve all but exhausted our morale by clarifying to passersby that no, Penn State and Penn are not the same university. And yes, Penn is actually active in areas outside of Wharton\u2019s finance programs.\nSo, when Penn Engineering announced its new undergraduate program in artificial intelligence, many of us were enthusiastic about the University\u2019s growing role in the innovation sector: a space thought to be dominated by less business-oriented institutions.\n\t\t\t\tSEE MORE FROM MRITIKA SENTHIL: Removing legacy admissions will align Penn\u2019s actions more closely with its educational missionWhy changing leadership won\u2019t eliminate antisemitism at PennBut Penn\u2019s realization, of possibly its most practical initiative, begs the question: Is the University actually necessary in DevOps? Does sitting in a classroom \u2014 let alone one that\u2019s in the midst of a campus known for its influx of finance bros \u2014 really supersede what can be MacGyvered by a tech junkie with only a laptop, caffeine, and time? I want to give a definite \u201cno.\u201d Otherwise, I would need to hold my classmates and myself accountable for upholding all the exclusivity that comes with attending Penn. And yet, there are a frustrating number of anonymous netizens, D-list journalists, and LinkedIn bards who call Ivy League universities like Penn \u201cout of touch\u201d \u2014 remnants of centuries-old American elitism in an era of bottom-up grassroots movements.\nOne C-suite executive anticipates that \u201cthe best AI engineers and builders won\u2019t graduate Penn Engineering. They'll be global, builders and in the right group chats.\u201d His readers agree, with one commenter further emphasizing that \u201cuniversities cannot keep up with the pace of free market innovation.\u201d When these schools attempt to go against the grain and align with consumer needs, \u201cit genuinely looks embarrassing and out of date.\u201d\n\tIn an environment where the use of AI models is largely democratized, we\u2019re naturally drawn to the trope of a layperson who forgoes bureaucratic systems to channel their intelligence: creating life-changing inventions that would have never come to be under self-serving corporate and political influences. And when ignoring cases of succor \u2014 as mainstream media unfortunately does \u2014 there are many examples of such successes. Bill Gates and Paul Allen, co-founders of Microsoft, were university dropouts. So were Meta Platforms co-founders Mark Zuckerberg and Dustin Moskovitz. As Penn\u2019s over reliance on donors came to light earlier this school year, critics of the upper crust have continued to group Penn with other perpetrators of social stratification. The field of AI is, by nature, continuously evolving. And limiting growth in the discipline to those who can afford, and then succeed in Penn\u2019s Department of Computer and Information Science courses is counterproductive.\nHowever, these narratives misrepresent the intentions of Penn\u2019s AI program.\nTo make a better case for Penn\u2019s AI major, I spoke with Robert Ghrist, Andrea Mitchell Professor and associate dean for undergraduate education at Penn Engineering. He describes how the process of integrating AI in education is similar to the effects of increasing access to music recording and playback technologies. Now, there is \u201cmore music for everyone at much lower prices,\u201d he told me. Nonetheless, \u201cartists at the very top of the industry\u201d are increasingly the benefactors of \u201ca concentration of rewards.\u201d Taylor Swift is, as any current news feed can attest to, perhaps the most prolific embodiment of such phenomena. And professor Ghrist strives to make Penn an incubator of sorts for the \u201cTaylor Swifts of AI\u201d that seek avenues for academic growth, to actually be the \u201cleading edge where the best thrive.\u201d\nAnd to thrive in this discipline, aspiring AI mavens are off course by simply memorizing browser instructions in JavaScript and praying for a tech equivalent of the coveted Goldman Sachs internship. After all, studying AI is a philosophical pursuit: an inquiry into the nature of consciousness and ethics of creating sentient machines. It\u2019s also a political pursuit, for AI poses challenges in regulatory compliance. There are countless possible liabilities for even the most basic ChatGPT input, such as unprotected user data and violations of intellectual property rights. \u00a0\n\t\tGet our newsletter, DP Daybreak, delivered to your inbox every weekday morning.Needless to say, as you might have noticed in my earlier columns, I am not an AI major. I\u2019m not even enrolled in Penn Engineering. Am I, of all students, in the right to quash critics of the Penn AI major when I dropped AP Computer Science in high school (with no regrets)?\nYet, it\u2019s clearly irresponsible to follow the well-intentioned advice from tech capitalists when constant innovation is not particularly ideal for society. Maybe I\u2019m just afraid of a \"Black Mirror\"-esque dystopia, but there is a kind of ominous quality to the idea of highly skilled AI scientists off the reins. Penn, however, is cultivating an ecosystem that nurtures AI talent, albeit not by stifling the next Elon Musk or Sam Altman with red-tape-ridden academics; instead, Penn fosters ethically conscious innovation that addresses complex societal challenges. And so, the fact that I can engage with the Penn curricula across departments has a surprising beauty. The opportunity to become a part of this technological movement \u2014 or, dare I say, revolution \u2014 is the gift of studying AI at Penn.\nMRITIKA SENTHIL is a first year studying management and Russian and east European studies from Columbia, S.C.

From frequent announcements regarding policies within classrooms to endless professors and visiting scholars weighing in on the unprecedented effect large language models will have on our lives, I\u2019m sure we\u2019ve all discussed to death how revolutionary ChatGPT has become for college students.\u00a0\nMany of us have even had the chance to firmly establish positions on whether the University should embrace the technology wholeheartedly or put in place safeguards to prevent it from eroding the value of a college education, but up until now, the vast majority of conversations have been on a non-technical level.\n\t\tThat all potentially changed in this past month when Penn announced their first Bachelor of Science in Engineering in AI. Thankfully for us, Penn has chosen to launch this interdisciplinary degree at the \u201coptimal time\u201d to \u201ccreate a society where AI isn\u2019t just a tool, but a fundamental force for good to advance society.\u201d But at what cost? To what extent should we be using college as an opportunity to hyperfocus on not just a certain field (computer science), but a field within a field? Majoring in AI panders to the pre-professionalism Penn is known for and removes many of the foundational elements of the field that underlie innovation.\u00a0\nIn an interesting recent LinkedIn post, David Magerman pondered the implications of a university building complete undergraduate curriculums around a \u201cmodern business tool that is a niche application of computer science, diverting students away from a broad education in computer science.\u201d He went on to ask pointedly, \u201cWhat's next?

A Wharton BS in Quantitative Trading?\u201d\n\t\t\t\tSEE MORE FROM AKIVA BERKOWITZ:The newsletter is dead\ufeffIsrael under attack: What do you stand for?As a current computer science major, I\u2019ll admit the AI curriculum looks fascinating. There is such an array of eye-catching electives (from Deep Generative Models to Natural Language Processing) that, if I were doing my degree all over again, I suspect I would have been swayed to switch into the major. But as a recently graduated computer and information science friend put it, the degree \u201cseems like the cool parts of CIS\u201d without the heavier basics like operating systems, computer systems, and physics \u2014 building blocks on the entire computer domain. \u00a0\nThe question I ask myself is whether artificial intelligence is really enough of an independent field that it transcends computer science and necessitates its own major. Is the relatively new field of AI established enough, broad enough, and unique enough such that the skills we gain through taking just those mostly career-focused courses today will undoubtedly remain relevant in 30 years and justify the $84,600 a year sticker price? I simply wonder how likely it may be that AI will become so unrecognizable in 20 or even 10 years, given its breakneck pace of innovation, that students may have wished that their majors in college focused on more fundamental elements of the field that innovators keep turning back to for insight.\u00a0\n\tAside from long-term career effectiveness an AI degree would have compared to computer science or electrical engineering, Penn is known for its pre-professional student body, and this new major shows signs of that sentiment leaking into the curriculum as well. In contrast to the Penn Integrates Knowledge professorships that bring in academic leaders who deeply understand multiple fields to better spark insight between them, this new major filters various courses of study to pluck out the elements we find valuable today.\u00a0\nIn this line of thinking, maybe we should consider the true value of a groundbreaking Wharton degree in quant trading that would promise to \u201csculpt the financial moguls of tomorrow\u201d with unparalleled prowess in algorithmic trading strategies and quantitative analysis.\u00a0\nAll this is to say, I immediately understand the value the current AI concentration within the larger CIS curriculum has. And I appreciate the Ph.D. programs that take students to a higher level of understanding, once they\u2019ve taken the time in their undergraduate training to build the broad foundations. I simply remain curious of the true value an AI undergraduate degree offers us as students over other forms of study within the field and the certain level of indulgence in pre-professionalism that it plays into on Penn\u2019s campus. I truly hope that I\u2019m proven wrong.\nAKIVA BERKOWITZ is an Engineering junior studying computer science from Silver Spring, Md.

          "title": "Eric Najera | Penn must take action to enhance the dining experience",
          "article_content": "As busy college students, most of us do not have time to cook our own meals, and if you are anything like me, cooking is far from your forte. The hassle of having to go to the grocery store, cook, and clean can be time consuming and even more difficult when you\u2019re overwhelmed with classes, clubs, and homework. For the many students without access to a kitchen in their dorm, this presents an even bigger challenge. Luckily, college campuses have dining halls! Students simply swipe their card to get access to an all-you-care-to-eat dining experience. Dining halls provide easy access meals to students\u2014but what happens when that food is inedible?\nAs a picky eater, I know that simply because I do not like a dish does not mean it is unsafe to eat, but food with cockroaches and glass is unsafe for anyone. A seemingly obvious underlying assumption in dining is that food is safe to eat. College dining halls should be a place where students go to eat well-cooked, hairless, and insect-free food. However, that is not the case at Penn: There is a lack of responsibility to make sure the food is meeting basic standards for, let alone satisfying, all students.\u00a0\n\t\tMeal plans are far from cheap. For the sticker price, students would expect quality food, but they would be wrong. Both of the first-year student meal plan options cost $6,330, with the maximum amount of swipes being 296. Each meal swipe equates to roughly $17, which is about the same price as a Caniac Combo at Raising Cane's. As previously stated, Penn dining hall food is far from gourmet, and its price is too high for the quality delivered.\u00a0\nExpensive dining plan meals are not unique to Penn, but other Ivy League schools have similar prices for better quality food. Cornell University offers an unlimited meal plan, so students may visit the dining halls as much as they want with a fixed cost of $6,942 for food ranked second-best in the nation. So, for roughly 600 more dollars, Cornell students have access to unlimited meals and substantially better quality dining.\u00a0\n\t\t\t\tSEE MORE FROM ERIC NAJERA: \ufeffWe should be grateful to attend PennPenn clubs should have an assigned faculty member\ufeffAside from price and quality, weekend dining is another struggle. With the popular McClelland Sushi & Market and Houston Market being closed on Saturdays and the other dining halls closing at 8 p.m., food options are limited. Late-night study sessions means having to resort to local food places that remain open, and unlike nearby schools such as Drexel, our dining dollars do not work at off-campus restaurants and out-of-pocket money spent on takeout can add up quickly.\nBefore every school break, Sidechat is flooded with posts of excitement for home-cooked meals. In my classes, when asked what we are excited for, most students reply being able to eat good food. It is not uncommon for college students to miss their home-cooked meals, but when students are excited to actually eat food that is not served alongside insects, it signifies a problem.\n\tWith Penn\u2019s Bon App\u00e9tit contract still in place, we may not know how much Penn can do to change the dining experience. Safe, clean food should not be an unreasonable expectation. In order to enhance a student's experience outside the classroom, Penn must budget for an edible food experience for all students.\nERIC NAJERA is a College sophomore studying history from Rolling Meadows, Ill.

          "title": "Zaid Alsubaiei | Does Penn\u2019s diversity represent its sense of community?",
          "article_content": "We all know the typical \u201ctypes\u201d of high schoolers, the different clich\u00e9s: Where are my nerds at? But, another attribute of student groups that has become increasingly relevant in the 21st century United States is the diverse ethnic makeup of its population. And, frankly, do we as a campus mirror all that comes with that national trend of diversity?\nThink of the friends with whom you often hang out. Then, ask those friends with whom they usually go out. Finally, think of the groups you are a part of, the extracurriculars in which you partake. Notice a pattern?\n\t\t\u201c[D]espite increased opportunity to live and work in mixed-race settings, Americans remain racially segregated in their friendship patterns,\u201d a study published by the National Institutes of Health found. \u201cSpatial racism, cultural encapsulation, and personal choice are contributing factors for patterns of same-race friendships.\u201d\u00a0\nThis pattern seems to reflect the divisions present in Penn\u2019s social scene as well. Despite coming from all sorts of backgrounds across the world, the University\u2019s students appear to have unconsciously adopted a policy of self segregation. In other words, we like to \u201cstick to our own\u201d by socializing with others to whom we relate to on a cultural, ethnic, or religious basis. So, regardless of Penn\u2019s efforts to integrate people of differing experiences and beliefs, there still remains a degree of resistance by individuals themselves to cross those racial or cultural lines.\n\t\t\n\t\nAs a result, the potential for diversity of thought is threatened. A narrow mindset develops within these groups that students pledge to, and they effectively act as echo chambers that exacerbate already crippling political polarization. We relate to each other less, rely on our \u201cown\u201d more, and become less tolerant of the views, and thus experiences, of those who do not necessarily look, think, or speak like us.\nThis kind of thinking \u2014 whether manifested in the form of race, religion, or otherwise \u2014 has led to serious tension at times and enabled a distorted view of certain communities and how they experience Penn. I attribute part of that thinking not to the identity groups we are a part of, but to how much we value them over who we are as individuals.\n\tHomogenous communities definitely have their place in the college experience: They help ease our transition when we first arrive at Penn, and their role cannot be replaced. I say this as an international student myself, who had a hard time acclimating to an entirely different culture and, most radically, diet. Nonetheless, we should treat these organizations as an aid to finding belonging on campus, not a substitute for individual thought and expression.\nHowever, none of this means individuals can\u2019t agree or always need to separate themselves from the group. The use of a large, collective voice can benefit our campus much more than we realize. What is important to note is that there lies a clear distinction between acknowledging the views of others and forcing ourselves to accept those views for the sake of conformity.\nThere is nothing wrong with disagreeing with the majority, whether it is one against two or one against a nation (though some may try to tell you otherwise). As long as you are respectful and driven by a desire to learn rather than defend, there are no limits on what perspective you may question. So, challenge your beliefs, reevaluate your viewpoint, challenge that of others (no matter who they are), and then reevaluate yourself again. It\u2019ll be hard at first, to express your precise, genuine thoughts without fear. But, remember that you\u2019re not alone (I struggle sometimes myself) and that it\u2019s a process you won\u2019t always get right.\n\t\tGet our newsletter, DP Daybreak, delivered to your inbox every weekday morning.The hardest part of breaking out of groupthink, after realizing it, is talking about it. My advice? Take the plunge and never look back. The next time you are in a group and the majority agrees with an idea you don\u2019t like, let it be known. Talk about it and explain why you think the way you do. Don\u2019t worry if some get offended or others simply do not agree; it is normal and, in fact, expected.\u00a0\nNever forget that disputes you engage in are an opportunity, not a challenge, and our differences are enlightening, not threatening. Only then will we begin to understand and appreciate each other more as unique actors in a truly historic community.\nZAID ALSUBAIEI is a College first year studying economics from Al-Khobar, Saudi Arabia.

          "title": "Eliza Carroll | You are what you read: Sidechat\u2019s impact on campus",
          "article_content": "I downloaded Sidechat this fall after my friends sent me too many screenshots of funny memes or jokes posted on the anonymous app. I figured that doing so would simply remove the middleman. I was already being exposed to the same jokes, memes, comments and judgements as those on the app anyway \u2026 right?\u00a0\nIn December, I returned home for reading days and fell into an easy pattern of studying. Nothing I did was wildly exciting or social, but I instead found myself enjoying the routine and satisfaction of productivity. During my study breaks, I would scroll on Sidechat \u2014 and from the comfort of my home, I felt myself spiraling into anxious dread about returning to Penn. Each time I opened the app, I was faced with a barrage of posts all echoing the same sentiment: Penn is awful and depressing. Without a second thought, I accepted those posts as fact, and in doing so, I allowed Sidechat to have more power than it deserves. In other words, I subscribed to the complaining culture that is pervasive on Sidechat.\u00a0\n\t\tUsing Sidechat, especially without intentional thought, is a way of looking at Penn through hypercritical glasses. Perhaps this is because negativity has been normalized and cynicism gets more upvotes. To some extent, this pessimistic messaging is diluted with the insertion of mildly entertaining memes or jokes, but the result is still the same. With each scroll, Sidechat is perpetuating a defeatist perspective of Penn.\u00a0\nSo, I arrived back at Penn to take my final exam: openly unhappy about returning to what I thought would be a bleak campus as a result of discourse on Sidechat. But to my surprise, it was not horrific, and I was able to enjoy my weekend of studying just as I had my week at home. The sheer volume of disheartening posts on Sidechat had clouded my perspective and ability to see the best in the situation. Sure, I was becoming one with a Huntsman GSR while others were at home enjoying break, but on the other hand, I was with my friends and able to have a sleepy campus all to myself.\n\t\t\t\tAs is the case with most other social media platforms, Sidechat is consumed passively and without a second thought \u2014 it\u2019s used to pass time, curb boredom, and satiate our addictions to our phones. And yet, students are absorbing and internalizing content more quickly than they can truly digest it.\u00a0\nGiven the bandwagon culture on Sidechat, users often build off of one another, creating a chaotic, and often dismal, echo chamber that does not truly represent life at Penn. Whether or not college is the best four years of your life, it is at least what you make of it, and Sidechat enables students to feel like victims of an unknown cause. For those who are actually struggling, Sidechat acts not as a productive outlet, but rather as a meta ether that provides no remedy other than the satisfaction that others are unhappy too.\u00a0\n\tSince winter break, I have in fact deleted Sidechat and am all the better for it. I still get sent the best and the brightest jokes by my friends, but I am no longer overwhelmed by unsolicited complaints on an hourly basis. Without Sidechat, my thoughts on the housing lottery, the floods in the Quad, and upcoming midterms are completely my own. Deleting Sidechat may not be for everyone, but it\u2019s imperative for those who chose to use Sidechat to take a more critical view of what is being circulated and evaluate whether or not they are benefiting from it. It may just change the way they see Penn.\u00a0\nELIZA CARROLL is a College first year studying international relations and art history from Greenwich, Conn.

          "title": "Cathy Li and Liala Sofi | History can\u2019t repeat itself; stand with Chinatown",
          "article_content": "Students for the Preservation of Chinatown protested outside the Board of Trustees meeting held at the Inn at Penn on Mar. 3, 2023. \nA few weeks ago, the streets of Chinatown came to life with firecrackers and lion dances ringing in the year of the dragon. As you walk through the brightly colored 40-foot paifang \u2014 known to most as Chinatown\u2019s Friendship Gate \u2014 you enter into a cultural oasis that has stood strong in the heart of Philadelphia for nearly 150 years. Beyond this fixture, Chinatown serves as a home to nearly 3,000 residents and numerous family-owned businesses, restaurants, shops, and community organizations. Whether you are going to Ken\u2019s Seafood Restaurant for a fun night out or Heng Fa for groceries, Chinatown feels like home.\u00a0\nUnfortunately, this community has been under constant attack for decades and is once again facing the threat of displacement and gentrification from a plan to develop an arena for the Philadelphia 76ers merely a block away. We firmly stand with the Students for the Preservation of Chinatown and urge you to do the same. \u00a0\n\t\tSince the early 1900s, Chinatown has been a victim of gentrification often driven by predatory infrastructure projects. In 1932, the construction of subway infrastructure at Ridge and Eighth streets \u2014 and the subsequent development of the Vine Street Expressway from 1957 to 1991 \u2014 resulted in the destruction of buildings and severe divisions within the community. Bringing in noise and pollution, the expressway eroded neighborhoods and people's quality of life. This was not Chinatown's sole battle, however, as it also faced multiple proposals of developments for a federal prison in 1992, a baseball stadium in 2000, and a casino in 2008.\u00a0\nThe story of Philadelphia's Chinatown mirrors other Chinatowns across the nation. Amid the 1994 fiscal crisis in Washington, D.C., then-Washington Wizards owner Abe Pollin negotiated a deal for the downtown Capital One Arena, where the city covered pre-development costs to acquire and demolish properties. Entrepreneurs in Washington's Chinatown voiced concerns about prices of real estate skyrocketing and parking impacts on businesses in the area. A decade later, most Chinese residents were forced to move out due to unaffordable housing. The parking shortage led to the closure of the last Chinese grocery store, accelerating the decline of the Chinese American population in the area to fewer than 400 residents today. Ironically, as D.C.\u2019s arena now relocates to the suburbs, the community is left behind, having endured irreversible destruction while in the midst of its recovery from the pandemic.\u00a0\n\t\t\t\tMORE FROM LIALA SOFI AND CATHY LI:Liala Sofi | The hypocrisy of billionaire philanthropistsCathy Li | Philadelphia\u2019s changing tastesIn New York\u2019s Chinatown, threats of displacement and economic insecurity also loom high. In 2021, the Museum of Chinese in America accepted a donation of $35 million in support of a borough-based jail complex which would displace Chinese American working-class people in the area. On top of that, its board executives were connected to the closing of the last unionized restaurant, beloved Jing Fong banquet hall, and construction of luxury towers that are actively raising rent and real estate taxes in the area.\nIn Philadelphia, the current 76Place project is being developed by 76 DevCo, an initiative by 76ers managing partners Josh Harris, David Blitzer, and David Adelman. Adelman is at the forefront of the construction of the arena and has promised not to displace the residents or businesses in Chinatown, but his past actions speak louder than his current words. Adelman works closely with Brett Altman, who also owns the University City Townhomes, and was a key figure behind the demolition and end of affordable housing in the West Philadelphia area that was previously known as the \"Black Bottom.\u201d This constant cycle of displacing residents and communities that have lived in the area for generations must end, and we must be the voice to make this happen.\n\tDevelopers of the project have stated that the arena will \u201cserve as a model for an equitable & inclusive community,\u201d yet there is not a single mention of Chinatown in the proposal. Efforts to ensure communities can benefit from this project read as empty promises when nearly 95% of residents, business owners, and visitors oppose the arena\u2019s construction.\nMany questions posed by residents have also gone unanswered by 76 DevCo. How will restaurants and small businesses in the surrounding area be protected? Who will clean the streets after huge events?\u00a0\nPreserving Philadelphia's architectural heritage demands careful consideration in urban development, but the development of the arena does the exact opposite \u2014 jeopardizing accessible low-income and senior housing complexes, healthcare clinics, and schools for children.\nPenn has direct ties to the developers in the area, and students should be cognizant of the situation. Adelman currently sits on Penn Medicine Board of Trustees and is the CEO of Campus Apartments, which houses many Penn students off-campus. But more importantly, Penn students are directly and indirectly involved in the Chinatown community, whether that be Penn Lions performing all throughout the city for Lunar New Year, or student groups like SPOC organizing initiatives to honor traditions celebrating the multi-ethnic communities that reside there.\u00a0\nDespite what greedy developers may suggest, Chinatown is not an ethnic theme park but a home. It\u2019s more than just a place to eat, it\u2019s a support network and a cultural hub for immigrants and visitors alike.\nIn the face of ongoing threats, Chinatown has demonstrated remarkable resilience and activism, advocating for the needs of all diverse communities of color that are integrated into the cultural fabric of our city. The next time you are in Chinatown, take a look around at all the place has to offer. Venture into Ebisu for some home decor and enjoy a Mochinut donut as you shop. Come by Dae Bak for soul-nourishing Korean barbecue. The opportunities to support your favorite restaurants and local businesses are endless.\nPlease don't turn a blind eye to what is happening outside the Penn bubble. Pay attention to what SPOC and other organizers are doing in the fight for the preservation of Chinatown. Educate yourself on what is going on in Chinatowns across the country. If you can, participate in programming like Crane Chinatown Community Center art exhibitions or Show Your Love for Chinatown events to learn more about the challenges facing the neighborhood. Sign petitions. \u00a0\nAdorned with dragon motifs, and gorgeous ornamental roof tiles, the Friendship Archway is not only an architectural masterpiece, but a labor of love \u2014\u00a0created for community by community. The engineers and artisans from Tianjin, China \u2014 Philadelphia\u2019s sister city \u2014 came together with residents and the city of Philadelphia to fund and invest in Chinatown, and you should too.\u00a0\nThe next time you walk through the gate, remember that the fight for Philadelphia\u2019s Chinatown, and Chinatowns everywhere, is not over.

          "title": "Caroline Magdolen | \u201cEveryone cheats.\u201d What can we do about it?",
          "article_content": "My guess is that nearly everyone reading this article knows someone who has been academically disingenuous, or been that someone before. Being academically dishonest isn\u2019t all about flashy examples, like the two admitted Penn students accused of plagiarism and fabricating data in 2022. There are smaller violations that may feel less egregious, or even harmless, like querying ChatGPT for help completing your homework, peeking at a friend\u2019s lab assignment, or answering a PollEverywhere as if you\u2019re in class, when really, you\u2019re snoozing in your dorm.\nAcademic dishonesty is having a moment in the spotlight. The advent of generative AI, the use of which cannot be reliably detected by grading softwares, will likely upend student learning for better or worse. At the same time, examples of plagiarism by prominent academics are being dug up left and right. The former president of Harvard, Claudine Gay, was ousted in part due to plagiarism concerns, and Business Insider found that former MIT professor Neri Oxman (the wife of billionaire Bill Ackman, who led the campaign against Gay) \u201cstole sentences and whole paragraphs from Wikipedia, other scholars and technical documents in her academic writing.\u201d\n\t\tTo be clear, I believe that academic dishonesty at Penn \u2014 going against community standards that your professor has explicitly outlined \u2014 is unacceptable, and that we should be doing more to penalize and prevent it.\nNevertheless, we must also acknowledge that academic dishonesty is understandable, in that we can piece together students\u2019 rationales when they do cheat, and even sympathize with them in some cases.\n\t\t\t\tSEE MORE FROM CAROLINE MAGDOLEN:\ufeffThe Rat Kings of PennThere\u2019s no better time for climate education\ufeffTo dissuade academic dishonesty, we employ sayings like, \u201cIt will only hurt you in the long run to cheat,\u201d or \u201cYou\u2019re taking advantage of other students who've completed their work fairly.\u201d This is true in some circumstances. If you\u2019re an aspiring quant and you\u2019re asking ChatGPT to calculate all of the derivatives on your MATH 1400 homework, it\u2019s going to show: First in your exams for the class, then in every math class you take thereafter, and especially in your future career. And if MATH 1400 is curved, your dishonest success capitalizes on the honest failures of others \u2014 not cool.\nBut this is not true in all cases. Jane* was a first year in her spring term when she was taking CIS 1210: Data Structures and Algorithms \u2014 a famously challenging CIS course \u2014 with Rajiv Gandhi, a famously challenging professor.\u00a0\n\tShe cheated on her coding assignment late into the semester, and as per the professor\u2019s policy, received a -300/100 on the submitted homework and zeros on all previously submitted homework, receiving a D as her final grade in the course.\nBut Jane believes that what is more important to her story is not what happened, but why it happened.\u00a0\n\u201cWhat drove me to make a bad decision? Why are [these classes] so infamous? It\u2019s because of notorious policies where you cannot collaborate on many assignments. You are given long problem sets to do, on your own, each week, with desperate students in office hour queues that are two to four hours long. Many times, you will go to the TA and not get a clear answer. It is a profoundly isolating situation, particularly for freshmen just entering college, and that\u2019s what drives well-meaning people to cheat.\u201d\nBased on my conversation with Jane, it seemed that she felt isolated at the time and was struggling to reach out for the support that she needed, both in CIS 1210 and at Penn as a whole. And given the limited support Jane could receive from TAs and her instructor, backtracking her friend\u2019s code felt more conducive to her learning than doing nothing.\nJane expressed a lot of remorse over what happened, and said that she still has a lot of respect for Rajiv, maintaining a good relationship with him to this day. She was also grateful that Rajiv was willing to handle this internally, since a low grade in the class looks better than a formal statement on her transcript, detailing her violation of academic integrity.\n\u201cI deserved to be punished harshly,\u201d Jane said. \u201cBut the collaboration policies of these introductory courses, and the punishment I received, wrecked my self-esteem and my early college experience. I felt that there was no way out.\u201d\nAccording to Jane, Rajiv's philosophy is to \"let go of your grades early: the sooner you stop caring about your GPA and start caring about learning, the better.\" She agrees with this philosophy, especially since he curves his courses generously, but sees this as out of touch with the realities of many Penn students.\nAfter students have prioritized perfecting their grades and resumes (and have been praised for it) in high school, those habits won\u2019t get undone overnight. Even at Penn, there are many institutions and accolades that continue to reward \u201cperfect\u201d performance over pursuing difficult academic disciplines, experimenting, and invariably messing up sometimes.\nFrankly, for a pre-med student in computer science (a track which Jane was considering at the time), the adage that \u201ccheating will hurt you in the long run\u201d skill-wise doesn\u2019t hold much water. The skillset of a future doctor and a software engineer just don\u2019t overlap enough. What can hurt a pre-med in the long run is a low GPA.\nAnd while there are some students for whom projects, internships, and technical interviews will get them a lot further in guaranteeing their success, this is not true for everyone. For many preprofessional students who may want to challenge themselves with a major or minor in CIS, they risk getting shut out of the study altogether.\nWhat frustrates me most about this entire situation is not that such harsh action was taken, but that it appears ineffective in tackling the issue at hand. If a student wanted to cheat, they could just take CIS 1600 or CIS 1210 during a different semester, when a different instructor was in charge and penalties were anecdotally known for being less harsh.\nWhile Jane\u2019s actions were clearly wrong, I can\u2019t help thinking that she was just the unlucky example that had to face the music, and she said as much in our interview: \u201cEveryone cheats in this class. You don\u2019t survive [CIS 1600 or CIS 1210] without talking to people, it just depends on whether you get caught. That doesn\u2019t make cheating okay, but it does mean that we need to rethink how these courses operate.\u201d\nSo, what can we do so that not everyone cheats?\nThis is a complex question, and there is no easy answer. It is crucial that as we frame the issue of academic integrity violations, we look at both the violations themselves and the root motivations that drive them \u2014 these actions are not taking place in a vacuum.\u00a0\nAcademic integrity violations these days are, to an extent, simply easier to commit. ChatGPT has led to a surge in \u201cunfair advantage\u201d violations. And even before generative AI, the pandemic had uprooted our usual test-taking environment. Now that classes are in person again, we no longer need to have take-home or open-Internet exams, but these still persist in some classes, and are easier to cheat on. Penn, given its history of fraudulent alumni, isn\u2019t going to be a place where professors can blindly trust students to refrain from cheating when presented with the option, so professors should take some responsibility for leveling the playing field in the classroom too.\u00a0\nJulie Nettleton, the executive director of Penn\u2019s Center for Community Standards and Accountability (CSA), relayed over email that CSA already works closely with schools and centralized resources at Penn to discuss how to proctor exams, and with faculty to discuss exams, syllabi language, and classroom policies.\nWhat constitutes a violation itself is currently not standard across classes, or even across different sections of the same class. How to handle a concern of academic integrity falls to the professor first \u2014 this is how Jane completed CIS 1210 with a lower grade, rather than a formal sanction from the CSA. It makes sense to delegate this responsibility to professors: It is more efficient than having the CSA handle every case, and professors should have the freedom to decide what constitutes cheating in their classrooms.\nHowever, this does open the door to students deliberately choosing sections of a course with professors that have more relaxed academic integrity policies. Conversely, some professors can be overly harsh, to the point where they are acting unfairly towards their students.\u00a0\nJill*, another student that I interviewed for this article, was falsely accused by her professor of collaborating on her final exam with her peers. At the start of winter break, the professor sent a class-wide email imploring those who worked together on the take-home exam to turn themselves in or have the matter escalated. Jill recalls that for students that turned themselves in, the professor lowered their grades accordingly \u2014 everyone else was reported to the CSA.\nIn the end, Jill\u2019s name was cleared, but she was assigned a case manager that seemed to have assumed she was guilty by default. As the case progressed, many of the details that the professor used to build the case against her appeared superfluous \u2014 for example, she and her friends had all rounded to the same decimal place in their work. Jill suspects that the escalation may have been personal: she had previously asked the professor, on behalf of the class, if he could make changes to his teaching style to facilitate learning.\nIt seems wrong to me that a professor could accuse a student and cause such extensive stress when in the end, Jill turned out to be innocent. It reminded me of some other methods that professors use to catch students cheating, such as Turnitin\u2019s flawed AI detector.\nPart of the solution to rampant academic dishonesty may also lie in expanding our vocabulary to discuss the issue, as John McWhorter pointed out in The New York Times. A class-wide cheating ring, direct plagiarism of original ideas from a paper as one\u2019s own, and copying a line of someone\u2019s code all constitute academic dishonesty, but range broadly in terms of severity and \u201cease of catching.\u201d However, this is rarely reflected in academic integrity policies.\u00a0\nIt can be awkward to suggest that some forms of dishonesty are worse than others, and more awkward still to draw the line between different punishments for different violations, but we must still have these conversations.\u00a0\nWhat should constitute dishonesty at all? When speaking with Jane, she would often circle back to how isolating it was to work alone on her assignments as a first year in introductory computer science courses, particularly as a woman in STEM. Every day, she would walk out of class \u201cfeeling way worse about [her]self.\u201d Now exploring chemistry, physics, and biology courses, she greatly appreciates the change in her academic environment, where students are encouraged to openly collaborate. The grade medians in chemistry are similar to those in CIS (which is to say, not great), but Jane is not as stressed as she was in CIS 1210, since she studies with her friends, and they can struggle and ask for help together.\u00a0\nWhile it was dishonest of Jane to copy code when it was against CIS 1210 policy, perhaps CIS majors and minors would learn more from the course if they were in a more collaborative environment to begin with. Jane has suggested that CIS 1210 should find a middle ground where students can learn from each other, but not be overly reliant on collaboration to perform well on exams.\u00a0\nShe also argues that there should be more opportunities for students to admit to academic dishonesty \u2014 through a friend at Stanford, she heard that at the end of a computer science class, students can select the assignments they have cheated on and receive a negative score on them, or risk facing more uncertain penalties if they are later caught.\u00a0\n\u201cThis policy gives people a second chance to do the right thing, and I do believe that you learn from an experience if you own up to it,\u201d Jane said.\nDeliberations over how best to address academic dishonesty can go on without end, but unfortunately this column must do just that. So here, I want to leave you with a reminder of what I said at the beginning: Academic dishonesty is unacceptable, but it is also understandable.\n\t\tGet our newsletter, DP Daybreak, delivered to your inbox every weekday morning.The hard, but necessary, solution to \u201ceveryone cheating\u201d is taking a good look at the stories behind academic dishonesty, and listening to the students involved with sympathy.

          "title": "Jack Lakis | What we can learn from Penn\u2019s college ranking",
          "article_content": "Last fall, a plethora of new results from U.S. News & World Report, Wall Street Journal, and Forbes elevated Penn in their national college rankings. Nearly every list places Penn among the top 10, some going as far as placing the University among the top five. This universal growth resulted from a key change in most of these sources\u2019 metrics: greater consideration given to postgraduate salaries.\nPenn famously has one of the highest-earning alumni bodies in the country. Starting salaries for Penn graduates are often considered the highest in the Ivy League. By mid-career, the average Penn alum is raking in $165,000 annually, while the national average for a college graduate caps out at $74,000.\n\t\tPenn draws a great deal of prestige from its potential to produce high earners, which is a direct result of our school\u2019s preprofessional culture. Nearly 50% of all Penn graduates enter one of two career fields: consulting or finance. This pipeline allows most Penn alumni to matriculate into high-paying jobs shortly after graduation.\nI\u2019m usually a defender of preprofessionalism. It\u2019s crucial that Penn graduates are able to find good jobs, and high salary potential is an immense advantage. But those jobs aren\u2019t everything. Many universities are making gains in rankings and name recognition based on alumni outcomes in public service careers.\n\t\t\t\t\ufeffSEE MORE FROM JACK LAKIS:\ufeffDo we all hate Penn?Staying focused after Magill's resignation\ufeffFor example, Harvard University boasts about its eight presidential alumni. However, when 1968 Wharton graduate Donald Trump was elected president, Penn mostly ignored his history with the school. Given his proximity to controversy and his unconventional political history, Penn\u2019s bump in prestige was limited by Trump\u2019s election. Our second closest claim to the White House is the University\u2019s relationship with President Joe Biden and the opening of the Penn Biden Center. I argue that this is as far as Penn\u2019s ties to the presidency will go. Nowadays, Penn\u2019s laser focus on professional development might repel students who will one day have presidential potential.\nComparable institutions to Penn have high-earning graduates and prestigious placements throughout the government, nonprofit sector, and the advocacy space. For example, Georgetown University feeds graduates into congressional offices and many Fulbright programs. Princeton University also regularly features its flashy roster of graduates in powerful political offices. These universities maintain a strong presence in the private sector but are also actively represented in government positions.\n\tIn these examples, the institution itself sponsors an undergraduate school dedicated to public service. At Georgetown, it\u2019s the School of Foreign Service, while at Princeton the role is filled by the School of Public and International Affairs.\nI propose that Penn follow suit and create a fifth undergraduate school dedicated to public affairs. This new school could absorb Penn\u2019s wildly popular social science programs, like PPE (Philosophy, Politics and Economics), Political Science, and Economics. Currently, most students in these majors are scooped up by consulting firms and investment banks. If these students were given an intentional focus on service and social responsibility, perhaps they could feel empowered to use their degrees in a more meaningful way.\nThe least Penn can do is expand its current effort to bridge the gap between social science degree seekers and careers in government and nonprofits. It\u2019s crucial that our student body actively engages with the robust policy infrastructure that Penn has already made available: Civic House, Perry World House, opportunities like Penn in Washington, and extracurricular engagements offered by the Government and Politics Association. From what I\u2019ve seen, these resources are underutilized at Penn. By snubbing them, Penn students are working against the general interests of the University to gain prestige.\n\t\tGet our newsletter, DP Daybreak, delivered to your inbox every weekday morning.Besides, it's about more than just rankings. We have the potential to empower our students to become leaders in society. TIME Magazine ranks Penn as the third-best college for aspiring leaders. However, the article states its rationale for this placement as a concentration of graduates in business careers. Other chart-topping schools on this list were noted for their programs in law, medicine, and more.\nUltimately, private sector homogeneity marks one of Penn\u2019s key weaknesses. As we move forward, Penn has a duty to educate leaders in more than one field. If Penn strengthened its programs in civic engagement, more graduates would be inclined to pursue roles in government and could elevate Penn\u2019s cultural stature. We should be known for more than salaries. We can do more than business.\nJACK LAKIS is a College first year studying political science from Kennesaw, Ga.

          "title": "Mia Vesely | Black Penn is vibrant this month and every month",
          "article_content": "As of late, most of my columns have focused on things I take issue with: Whether it\u2019s Liz Magill\u2019s resignation and the threats to free speech on campus, or the lack of racial diversity in Panhellenic sororities. I haven't highlighted the things that I truly appreciate and, more specifically, the places in which I\u2019ve found community at Penn.\nLast February, I argued that Black history is important for everyone. Education surrounding Black people, their lives, and their contributions should be integrated into the standard curriculum. Black Penn shows up and shows out every month, but this month in particular, there are many events and ways that Penn student organizations uplift the community and come together.\u00a0\n\t\tIt would be impossible to touch on all of these amazing events and their impacts, but I\u2019d like to paint a picture of some of these groups and their initiatives during this month and beyond. Planning for these events takes months. For example, when Descendants of Afro-Americans at Penn (DAAP) \u2014 a club founded just last year \u2014 put on their first-ever gala on Feb. 1 to kick off the month, you better believe that the event was well-planned and executed.\u00a0\nThe gala \u2014 Red Carpet For A Cause \u2014 supported the Sickle Cell Disease Association of America's Philadelphia and Delaware Valley Chapter. The night included catered food, live performances from student groups like The Inspiration, wonderful community, and beautiful decor\u2014even including an ice sculpture of the DAAP logo. Over $1,700 was raised in support of the foundation.\n\t\t\t\tSEE MORE FROM MIA VESELY:\ufeffI dropped sorority rush and I\u2019m gladFirst Liz Magill, next free speechWhen asked about the impacts of the event, College sophomore and DAAP founding member Clarke Dickens said, \u201cWe wanted to bring the community together for a great cause, especially a cause that affects a lot of African Americans and Black people more broadly.\u201d\nSickle cell disease occurs in about one in every 365 Black babies born in the United States. The percentage of Black people who carry the trait is even higher, with one in 13 Black babies being born as carriers.\n\tDickens is not just involved with DAAP, but is also on the boards for QBlack and Shea Collective.\nThese clubs are all part of something commonly dubbed \u201cBlack Penn,\u201d which focuses on so many different aspects of identity. From cultural organizations like Penn African Student Association (PASA), to preprofessional organizations like Black Wharton and the Black Pre-Law Association (BPLA), to community service organizations like the NAACP, all of these organizations put an emphasis on service both inside the Penn community and out.\u00a0\nFor example, Campus Curlz \u2014 a club I serve on the board of \u2014 is, at first glance, a club centered around uplifting natural hair and embracing positivity. \u00a0But underlying hair mask making events and movie nights, there is a strong commitment to service. Just this month, the community service committee held an event where we made Valentine\u2019s Day cards for senior citizens at Mercy Life West Philadelphia.\nService by board members is a requirement to be part of funding organizations like UMOJA \u2014 the umbrella funding organization for Black clubs \u2014 and even beyond that, many clubs center service in every activity they partake in. Whether you\u2019re on the board of a club or not, there are many service opportunities available and encouraged.\nWhen asked what they wish people knew about Black Penn, Dickens said, \u201cClubs should make an effort to include grad students, it makes all the difference. I\u2019m able to say, \u2018This is what I would look like coming here for grad school,\u2019 and it can even offer opportunities for mentorship.\u201d\nWhat seems to drive Black Penn is first and foremost the students, then the supportive and involved faculty, as well as the local partnerships and opportunities the clubs find, build, and pursue for themselves. Many members of the DAAP board are native to Philadelphia, so that makes their work even more personal.\nWhile Black students do take initiative to realize what they need and create the spaces they want to see, there is so much room for improvement on behalf of Penn: whether it\u2019s stratifying the way funding is given to these clubs \u2014 they often can\u2019t fund silverware in UMOJA meetings if it can be provided elsewhere \u2014 or improving the cultural spaces available to students (we were promised the ARCH \u2018building,\u2019 not the ARCH \u2018basement\u2019). In months like February, Penn aims to spotlight their Black students. I just wish this recognition of the incredible community Black students forged for themselves, when they initially didn\u2019t see it on campus, came year-round.\n\t\tGet our newsletter, DP Daybreak, delivered to your inbox every weekday morning.Events like DAAP's gala happen every month, and it\u2019s important not to understate the role these organizations play in making Penn a welcoming and accepting place for students from marginalized backgrounds.\nI was happy to see Faces of Black Penn \u2014 a Black-run publication \u2014 highlighted in the DP last week. I hope people continue to uplift the work of these student groups going forward and make space to give all students their roses. Black History Month is not over, and the time to appreciate Black students and their work does not end come March.\nMIA VESELY is a College sophomore studying philosophy, politics, and economics from Phoenix, A.Z.

          "title": "Bernadine Kumi | I joined a sorority and I\u2019m glad",
          "article_content": "I\u2019ll be honest: I was not a fan of Greek life when I first got to Penn. My perception of Greek life was influenced by growing up in the South, mainly in suburban Georgia. This included a sorority scene of girls with fake spray tans and little to no personality. The images of sorority girls from the University of Georgia and Alabama screamed no diversity, which made me wary of joining a sorority at Penn. Being a First-Generation, Low-Income (FGLI) student made me especially hesitant. Even more so, coming from a Ghanaian household, the notion of a sorority was immediately dismissed as something against our Christian values. Thus, during my first year, I knew I would never, and I mean never, join a sorority.\u00a0\nHowever, by the beginning of sophomore year, my mindset began to change. After a year on campus, I had found a solid community of a small group of friends. But beyond that, I felt that I did not really know anyone. I couldn\u2019t name more than 20 people in my grade. Penn is known for being a networking school, and the \u201cSocial Ivy,\u201d so I began to question just how much I had taken advantage of that. That, along with most of the underclassmen party scene revolving around fraternities, made the idea of rushing even more appealing.\u00a0\n\t\tSo while most people were beginning their sophomore year with the friends they already had, I began to look for additional friends. My twin sister, who also goes to Penn, and I began attending open rush events, talking to sophomores in sororities, and involving ourselves in more social events. Over the next few months, my days consisted of talking to many girls, going to dinners, and putting myself out there in a way that I had been hesitant to do before. I made new friends, met fellow sophomores also in search of a bigger community, and found myself loving the idea of joining a sorority.\u00a0\nBut what made me even more eager was just how inclusive and diverse sororities were at Penn, more so than I had been expecting\u2014especially the off-campus sorority I ended up joining, OAX. I was still wary about rushing, but as soon as I got to the first event, I immediately felt comfortable. There were girls with different interests, passions, economic backgrounds, and personalities. Not a single conversation felt forced. Every girl I met had a unique and authentic story, and I felt like I could talk to them for hours.\n\t\t\t\tSEE MORE FROM BERNADINE KUMI:\ufeffDining hall workers at Penn Hillel demand better treatment from UniversityI was especially captivated by BLOAX (Black OAX), a community within OAX that includes fellow girls of Ghanaian descent and other Black girls who provided me with guidance on navigating Penn as a Black woman. OAX also has other smaller communities, such as LatinOAX and RainbOAX. Being able to find other people with similar backgrounds made the choice to join a sorority that much easier.\u00a0\nAs a FGLI student and Questbridge scholar, the idea of paying high dues out of my minimal work paychecks every month was unfathomable. I knew that joining a sorority would pose another financial burden, and even though I was loving the OAX community, the idea of paying dues scared me. Yet once again, OAX and other sororities surprised me with their understanding and financial transparency. They worked with me to develop an affordable monthly payment plan so that I, like every other girl interested in rushing, could also enjoy being in a sorority.\u00a0\n\tSince the morning of Bid Day when I got \u201cthe call,\u201d I know that I truly made the right decision by joining a sorority, for not only my social life but my professional life too. This past fall, I was able to land a summer internship in Los Angeles with the help of my grand-big. I was also able to prepare for my interview with girls in my sorority, who gave me the confidence I needed to land the opportunity. As a Black woman and FGLI student, I have truly benefited from joining Greek life. I hope students who are hesitant to rush, just as I once was, will see my experience and how transformative it can be. I hope others \u2014 whether they are Black women, FGLI students, or just Penn students in search of a greater community \u2014 can do the same.\nBERNADINE KUMI is a College junior studying political science and legal studies and history from Roswell, Ga.

          "article_content": "Columnist Jessey Shin explores the problem of disparate advising quality in the College and argues \nfor a more standardized experience.\u201cMy advisor lied to me?\u201d\nI remember someone saying this to me in complete disbelief, but I can\u2019t say I\u2019m surprised. Advisors can be as misleading as they are helpful, and this is a widespread problem that needs addressing.\n\t\tIn the College, students typically have between 15 and 20 credits outside of their primary major to meet the graduation requirement. These are used to fulfill general education requirements, pursue a second major or minor, or take elective courses that align with a student\u2019s interests.\nThe freedom to pursue one\u2019s intellectual pursuits is, of course, one of the draws of the College. I am looking to pursue two majors myself, in somewhat interconnected but disparate fields of study: the flexibility offered by the curriculum allows me to explore these interests without taking an obscene number of classes.\n\t\t\t\tSEE MORE FROM JESSEY SHIN:Making a case for the less popular college housesNavigating the maze of Penn's resources\ufeffThe problem is few students go into their first year knowing which major they would like to pursue, much less exactly which courses to take.\u00a0\nThe College puts a lot of effort into informing incoming students about the curriculum and what they have to offer, such as through the Compass module on Canvas that gives a foray into some aspects of the College experience (something that other schools do not offer). However, the sheer number of options can be overwhelming, giving rise to a unique need for personalized, one-on-one guidance. This is where pre-major advisors come in.\u00a0\n\tPre-major advisors, assigned to each student before they start their first semester at Penn, are a vital resource for College students. They guide students through the course selection process, encouraging and helping them as they explore their various interests and eventually settle on a major.\nI can say that I have had a relatively good experience with my pre-major advisor. However, I also found that some of the advice offered was not fully applicable to my circumstance, because of the recent transition from Penn InTouch to Path@Penn.\nOther students, however, are not as lucky. I have heard stories about advisors making their students cry, spreading misinformation, jeopardizing their advisees\u2019 course registration, you name it.\nIn an interview, one student (who requested anonymity) shared that they have had trouble reaching their pre-major advisor from the get-go. College students must meet with their advisor one-on-one to get their course registration hold lifted; without this, they are not eligible to participate in advance registration. The student was only able to reach their advisor a day or so before the deadline and has continued to have trouble with availability.\nOf course, their pre-major advisor experience was less than ideal. \u201cHer guidance wasn\u2019t so much guidance as it was looking at the boxes and seeing if I checked them,\u201d they said. \u201cI don\u2019t think I would feel comfortable going to her for personal issues, such as which major to pursue or how to explore [some of my interests], because I don\u2019t think she would point me [in] the right direction.\u201d Instead, they had been utilizing their PennCAP advisor (available for FGLI students) for these concerns.\nOn the other hand, some students are able to form a positive relationship with their advisor and find that they are helpful in navigating their interests. Rishi Dadlani, a College first year, described his advisor as \u201cfriendly and helpful. He gave me his phone number and told me to contact him if I [had] any questions \u2026 If I saw him around campus, I would say hi, and he always sends us a beginning-of-semester email.\u201d\n\t\tGet our newsletter, DP Daybreak, delivered to your inbox every weekday morning.This disparity in advising quality means that some students are at a great disadvantage compared to others. While some advisors are able to \u201cpoint students in the right direction,\u201d helping them take the right step forward in their college experience, others fall short. Their advisees must navigate the complicated process of learning about the majors, gen-ed requirements, and figuring out (the surprisingly difficult) advance registration process on their own.\nWhen done right, the freedom of the College curriculum can allow students to truly delve into their academic interests and eventually settle on the right path for them. However, that process requires a lot of research and planning that is supposed to be aided by a pre-major advisor. For incoming first years who are unfamiliar with the landscape at Penn and underclassmen students, this disparity in advising quality poses a challenge. Penn must ensure that all students are able to best utilize the resources at their disposal, and the first place to start is with the guidance they receive.\nJESSEY SHIN is a College first-year studying sociology and communications from Seongnam-si, South Korea.

This month offers an opportunity to delve into the depths of history: exploring narratives that challenge, inspire, and provoke thought. In the spirit of true academic inquiry and in honor of this significant month, I wish to highlight a selection of works by Black authors whose perspectives might diverge from the more commonly embraced interpretations of Black history and culture.\n\t\tIn recommending these texts, my intention is not to endorse every opinion expressed by the authors, but to underscore the importance of engaging with a diversity of viewpoints. These authors challenge us to look beyond the prevailing orthodoxy and to question the narratives that have become commonplace within academic circles. They remind us that the Black American experience, like any aspect of human history, is richly diverse and complex.\nAs members of an academic community that prides itself on intellectual rigor and openness, it is our responsibility to explore a broad spectrum of perspectives, especially those that provoke debate and reflection.

          "article_content": "\u201cWelcome to Penn! You are the most diverse class we ever admitted!\u201d The convocation rhetoric makes you feel so special. Penn is diverse because a student comes from Wisconsin and another from Kazakhstan. One plays the flute, one plays squash. Never mind that all of them want to be bankers or consultants. I wish someone had told me that nearly every other person sitting at Convocation with me would end up in the funnel. That however diverse my first-year class was, my senior class would simply not be.\nAs a teaching assistant for Wharton\u2019s required \u201cBusiness and You\u201d leadership course, I mentor first years adjusting to college and exploring careers. Someone confessed, \u201cIf not banking, then what else could I possibly do?\u201d If the best business school in the world (U.S. News debates aside) makes you believe you only have one option from day one, the institution, culture, and entire system have fundamentally failed.\n\t\tOf course, there is nothing wrong with those jobs: The last thing we need is a trembling economic system and inefficient markets. The problem is blindly assuming that one in two employed Penn grads and 80% of Wharton grads woke up and consciously made such a decision. Unpacking our culture proves how little of a decision this is and how everything revolves around two words: prestige and control.\nIt is common knowledge by now that Penn students are privileged. However, you may not know that for every single student from the bottom 20%, over 21 people come from the top 20%, blithely offsetting their upbringing. The result? An abject elite detached from reality. Okay, perhaps this is cynical, but if we are known for our elitist \u201cseeing and being seen\u201d culture, is it a surprise that 25% of us are so disillusioned to think the average U.S. salary is above six figures? Of course not (both not surprising and not true).\n\t\t\t\tPenn\u2019s alarming lack of socioeconomic diversity (despite efforts acknowledged this) unequivocally creates a culture perpetuating the value of money at the expense of everything else. The people you sit next to in class distract you with their laptop screens: purchasing a Gucci bag or booking Airbnbs in Cancun. The emails you receive are about banking and consulting events. This is the model. The only one. The only one, right?\nLet\u2019s be honest, \u201cjust follow your passion\u201d won\u2019t pay the bills, and I cannot blame an indebted or underprivileged student for desiring financial freedom with a high-paying job.

Which one makes sense for YOU?\n\tEveryone at Penn is good at planning, several are good at doing, and almost none are good at reflecting. The purpose of your college education is not exclusively career preparation. If this is what they had you do, I hate to tell you that you have been robbed. As writer William Deresiewicz argues, \u201cWhat you should want to develop in college is the habit of reflection, which means the capacity for change because most of what you come across in college will inevitably fade from memory. What is left over, precisely, is you.\u201d A culture, even more so an institution, should give you the tools to understand what model of life you want to live, not impose the model on you.\nYet, my student's question is central and inevitable: What else if not banking?\nAsking yourself what truly energizes you is no easy task, because it requires the vulnerability to let go of the comforting lifetime certainty that the predetermined path gives you: 2025 summer recruiting, analyst, associate \u2026 Well, the desire to eliminate uncertainty eliminates life. What do you plan to do after \u201csome years of experience\u201d with your future free time and why on earth are you not doing it now?\nIn his book \u201cExcellent Sheep,\u201d Deresiewicz advocates for the importance of time off, slowing down, breaking the cycle of endless achievement, and acknowledging the existence of a world outside of your Ivy League. It may be scandalous to some and unmistakable to others, but what if you replaced your obsessive passion for finance with one that is harmonious, perhaps exploring capacities you have not had a chance to cultivate? What if you did something you purposefully cannot put on a resume or post on LinkedIn?

          "article_content": "Columnist Mariana Martinez describes her personal experiences with Penn's dining services.A text from my friend lit up my phone.\u00a0\n\u201cDude, you\u2019re literally getting the reverse Freshman 15!\u201d\n\t\t\u201cThe what?\u201d I replied.\nAs an international student, I had no idea that Freshman 15 was a thing. But by the time I found out what it was, it was already too late. My eating schedule became very irregular: I skipped meals thinking it was more practical for me. Because of Penn\u2019s poor dining services and few inclusive food options, my physical and mental health were severely affected by the end of my first semester.\u00a0\n\t\t\t\t\ufeffBefore coming to Penn, when people asked me what I would miss most from Colombia, I usually answered by saying I'd miss the food. But as my first semester flew by, I realized it went beyond missing my country\u2019s food and more into an overwhelming transition and violent adjustment to the American diet, characterized by fast-food consumption, takeout over-reliance, and a lack of fresh food. It made my transition to college even more overwhelming than it already was.\u00a0\nI never expected diet to pose the challenge it did during my first semester. I didn\u2019t expect my food options to narrow so suddenly. The differences between the American and other countries\u2019 diets cause international students to mess up their meal structure. In the midst of the American diet, breakfast becomes the least important meal, meal times become arbitrary, and late dinners are frequent.\u00a0\n\tI found myself skipping breakfast because I couldn\u2019t tolerate American breakfast foods: bacon, potatoes, sausage, casseroles. I stopped eating fruit, and I started eating only one large meal a day. At the same time, I was pushing myself to be my best in my classes, clubs, and job while running on very little fuel. By winter break, my body was pretty much destroyed.\nAs I asked other international students about their dining habits, I found that my experience was not an isolated one. Some of them told me that they \u201cjust don\u2019t know what to eat anymore.\u201d Others said that because of their international status, they had a limited budget to eat off-campus and that relying on Penn\u2019s terrible food was torturous.\u00a0\nSurveys have shown that as international students transition into their lives at American universities, many face dietary challenges and health consequences. For instance, many international students report a halt in their fruit and vegetable consumption because they believe the United States\u2019 options are not as fresh. Others report severe weight loss/gain and stomach issues from struggling to adapt to an American diet that consists mainly of meals large in sugars and fat.\u00a0\nBack in Colombia, I was used to having almost five meals a day. My diet included cereals and a variety of meats, vegetables, and fruits. Other international students also report being accustomed to multi-course meals, often characterized by a careful, homemade preparation. On the other hand, the American diet narrows down choices abruptly. International students describe their choices as pizza, salad, pasta, French fries, sandwiches, and chicken \u2014 which holds true to the quintessential Penn dining experience.\u00a0\n\t\tGet our newsletter, DP Daybreak, delivered to your inbox every weekday morning.Being thrown into a poor dietary environment has a significant impact on students\u2019 mental health. Many studies show that students with poor dietary conditions are more likely to suffer from depression and anxiety. The dietary conditions at Penn have impacted my emotional well-being: It is very frustrating to feel like I have no high-quality dining options. The strain on my wallet as I buy groceries and off-campus food is also stressful, considering around a third of Penn\u2019s international students are on financial aid.\u00a0\nThe international student experience with the food at Penn can only be described as aggravating. Not only is the American diet more unhealthy than food in international students\u2019 countries, but it also causes disruptions in meal structure and health. As a school that prides itself on being diverse, Penn should really focus on making the dining experience more accessible for its international students. Not to mention an improvement in the food would benefit the whole student body, given recent events. It is clear that this becomes a matter beyond just food: it\u2019s also about inclusivity, general well-being, and enjoying the college experience.\u00a0\nMARIANA MARTINEZ is a College first year studying English and classics from Bogot\u00e1, Colombia.

          "title": "Chapin Lenthall-Cleary | The Penn administration farcically mistreats new student clubs",
          "article_content": "Guest Columnist Chapin Lenthall-Cleary highlights the bureaucratic hurdles that face student organizations and clubs at Penn.It's no secret that many of the University's student clubs are brutally exclusive \u2014 often demanding prospective members submit applications and participate in interviews \u2014 only to bar most of them from participating anyway. It's no secret that this system of club exclusivity inflicts a variety of harms on students: It deprives them of opportunities to participate in academic, service, recreational, and other activities. It shuts them out of a significant avenue of making friends. It pits students against each other. It furthers a culture obsessed with credentials over learning (or whatever a club's mission might be). And, as if all of that weren't damaging enough, it wastes non-trivial amounts of students' limited time at the University.\u00a0\nIt's far less well known, however, that the University's administration \u2014 especially the Office of Student Affairs \u2014 imposes numerous stringent, farcical, and sometimes nearly insurmountable hurdles upon new, often open-membership clubs.\u00a0\n\t\tIn October 2022, I founded Penn Humans vs. Zombies (HvZ), a (then-unofficial) club that held live-action zombie apocalypse games with Nerf blasters in David Rittenhouse Laboratory. The games were open to everyone and attracted a range of undergraduates across various schools, plus graduate students, alumni, a few students from nearby schools, and occasionally a professor. We required no applications or interviews, even for club leadership positions, which were filled by those willing to do the extra work to help run the games. Against even the advice of some club officers, I refused to charge admission.\u00a0\nI don't want to oversell this: Lance or not, I wasn't killing any windmills. One silly game with an earnest mission, of course, wasn't fixing a broken system, nor was HvZ the only open-membership club at Penn. But HvZ was at least one example of something the University desperately needs and badly, though not completely, lacks places for Penn students to find community and friends with shared interests, free from demands to run a marathon in a rat race just for a chance at being let in the gate. In fact, my uncompromisingly open-membership policies are exactly what even OSA claims to want.\n\t\t\t\tSEE MORE FROM \ufeffOPINION:\ufeffEmily Chang | No Senator, not all Asians are ChineseKiyah Akins | How I have been shaped by Black historyAbout a year passed before I realized that our zombies weren\u2019t the most soulless people HvZ would have to face. Last fall, after hearing about HvZ, the building manager contacted me, demanded that I stop the games, and revoked my 24/7 access to DRL. I reluctantly agreed to stop holding the games in DRL, but I reached out to the director of OSA to appeal the decision, where I was met with a tsunami of bureaucracy and an instruction to stop the games until they gave approval. The process involved meetings between multiple members of OSA, public safety, risk management, and others. When I asked to be involved in these discussions, I received the canned reply, \"[OSA has] not traditionally included students at this stage of conversation.\"\u00a0\nIt took over a month to get permission from OSA to continue the games and about as long to sort out the actual process of getting a space. There was just one problem: OSA's Kafka-and-friends committee decided that HvZ had to occur in an athletic space. When I tried to rent such a space, I discovered that doing so would cost $75 an hour, or around $4,500 per semester for a four-hour game once a week, an impossible cost for our club. When I told the OSA director that having to pay this fee to continue our game would be as good as a death sentence for HvZ and asked for the fee to be waived or paid, I was told to go find funding. I'll say that again: We spent months waiting, only to be told that we needed to find a way to get the University to pay us thousands of dollars \u2014 that we'd use to pay Penn the fee they decided to charge us \u2014 to play a game that costs them nothing.\n\tI did everything the OSA director suggested and more to try to get funding. As it currently stands, we have only a small fraction of what we actually need. And, I'm not hopeful, because this isn't the first time I've tried to get funding for a club.\u00a0\nLast winter, I founded Drone Club, another open-membership club. This one was dedicated to building drones, and I was willing to teach less experienced students the electronics, soldering, physics, and skills involved in doing so. Initially, I paid largely out-of-pocket for parts, but this wasn't ideal or particularly sustainable, so I sought club funding. With significant effort and about a month's delay, we got $220, about half of what we requested, from the Common Funding Application, the very funding source the OSA director suggested we use to find thousands of dollars for HvZ. In fall 2023, in order to secure larger, more regular funding, I applied for SAC recognition, the primary avenue for regular club funding, for Drone Club.\u00a0\nDrone Club was rejected for the sole reason of not having been on the PennClubs website since Oct. 31, 2022 (yes, that\u2019s over a year before we applied, and it\u2019s different from the deadline listed on the SAC website). The stated reason for the requirement that inspired that rejection is that \"student groups must be sustainable,\" which requiring students to check a box a year in advance obviously does little to confirm. Indeed, as I noted in Drone Club's application, where I asked SAC \"not to reject us upon a technicality, and instead judge us upon our merits,\" Drone Club's mostly underclassman membership is an infinitely better metric for sustainability.\u00a0\nEven clubs that are accepted still aren't written into the SAC budget until the school year after applying. Combined together, these requirements mean that, even if nothing goes wrong, a new club takes years to receive SAC budget funding. Under the current system, a sophomore who started a club now would graduate before having a chance at seeing any SAC budget funding.\u00a0\nThe above is only a small fraction of the examples of Penn institutions' hostility towards new clubs: being denied tables at the activity fair, having Drone Club removed from the PennClubs website for not getting Engineering Student Activities Council recognition (which, according to the PennClubs website, isn't a requirement), and more. If you're shocked by the severity and regularity of this problem, keep in mind that these are only examples of the University's administration\u2019s hostility towards new, open-membership clubs that I run (and therefore know about), which are doubtlessly a tiny subset of the full problem.\u00a0\n\t\tGet our newsletter, DP Daybreak, delivered to your inbox every weekday morning.Despite this relentless onslaught, I still don't know how this story ends. There's still a scenario where a powerful administrator decides to put the welfare of students above rules and diktats, and says, \"Enough of this nonsense,\" and HvZ gets to return triumphantly to DRL, or at least to another good location, free from extortionate fees. There's still a scenario where Drone Club secures its funding for parts, and the many other clubs doubtlessly facing similar farcical obstacles are instead met with a well-lit road, not numerous Harnwell-and-a-half-high hurdles. Heck, there's still a scenario where OSA lives up to its stated ideals and starts staunchly supporting open-membership clubs and exerting real force to get closed-membership clubs to open up.\u00a0\nThis hasn't been a happy story, and I'm frankly not betting on that changing. Nor, sadly, would a single exception for HvZ solve this massive harm to students, thrilled though I\u2019d be to get such an exception. But this story isn\u2019t over yet. If enough people, or even one person with enough power, decide to end this farce today and decide that doing right by students must always come first, there could yet be not only a happy ending to HvZ's struggle but also a bright future for all open-membership clubs at the University. To the administrators who\u2019ve caused this damage and to those who have the power to fix it, shape up.\nCHAPIN LENTHALL-CLEARY is a College senior studying physics and philosophy from Radnor, Pa.

          "article_content": "This semester, I somehow ended up with four out of my five classes being either directly or indirectly about ethics. As a political science major, I was really excited to take these classes, since whenever people talk about ethics nowadays, it mostly has to do with politics or international relations.\nAt a time when our reality changes so rapidly because of technology, and when we are faced with a number of global challenges, some people have forgotten about the importance of acting morally. Especially at a place like Penn, where everyone seems to be extremely worried about their future and their careers, people often disregard these values when they are caught up by the competitive environment. Because of this, one would think that ethics classes would be extremely beneficial for all, but do they actually contribute to making students more ethical individuals?\n\t\tAccording to my professors, they don\u2019t.\nIn all four ethics classes, my professors started the semester by telling us that ethics classes will not make most of us more ethical. I sat there, listening to all of them, and I just could not understand why they would say something like that. If I wasn\u2019t going to learn anything, what was the point of taking these classes?\n\t\t\t\tSEE MORE FROM ZARA TENA:The urgent need for younger voices in politics\ufeffIt\u2019s okay to be ordinaryThat\u2019s where I was wrong: I have been learning a lot. While perhaps the main goal of ethics classes is not to turn students into more ethical people, they definitely give us the tools we need to critically engage with ethical dilemmas. By taking these classes, I might not become a better person, but they have given me a space where I can explore, discuss, and reflect about where I stand on so many issues and what my beliefs about morality actually are.\nEthics is not a subject that can be forcefully taught through lectures and readings. There is no way that we can sit down for three hours every week and magically become more ethical just because we memorize theories and read long papers written by old white men. The goal of these classes is not to tell us what is \u2018right\u2019 or \u2018wrong,\u2019 \u00a0but to give us the skills to navigate the gray areas in ethical decision making.\n\tThese classes encourage self reflection and personal growth. Even when analyzing big case studies or exploring different theories, students are pushed to question their own values, beliefs, and biases. While this may not guarantee that we will completely transform our moral compasses, the self awareness that comes from these reflections creates a great foundation for understanding why we act the way we do and also invites us to try to understand others.\nThe fact that ethics classes begin with a warning \u2014 that you won\u2019t become more ethical by taking them \u2014 should not stop anyone from giving them a chance. The ability to think critically, understand different values and perspectives, and have the skills to self reflect are essential parts of any college education. They prepare students for the complicated moral dilemmas they might face in their personal and professional lives \u2014 especially when most people at Penn will end up with jobs that are notorious for their ethical scandals!\nZARA TENA is a College sophomore studying political science from Puebla, Mexico.

          "article_content": "How many times have you found yourself in a never-ending cycle of back-and-forth messages, trying to pin down a date for a long overdue catch up with a friend? Every get together begins to feel as if it requires intricate planning and strips away the simplicity of social connection. This routine becomes stifling, lacking spontaneity and authenticity; you\u2019re constrained to coordinating with the same faces in the same places.\u00a0\nThis is what I like to call scheduling fatigue.\u00a0\n\t\tAs a result of this phenomenon, gatherings among friends are beginning to resemble scheduled business meetings, meticulously arranged via tools like When2Meet or synchronized Google Calendars.\nWhile resorting to scheduling may seem like the only viable option to maintain a semblance of social connection, perhaps it's time to embrace the idea of venturing out solo: I\u2019m challenging you to go on an unplanned side quest all by yourself to a third place.\u00a0\n\t\t\t\tMORE FROM LALA MUSTAFA:A nation on defense: Dismantling misinformation against Azerbaijan in the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict\ufeff\ufeffAllow me to explain. Picture the first place as your home and the second as your place of education or work. Now, the third place emerges as a public sphere where individuals congregate, not out of any obligation like in the previously mentioned locations, but, for lack of a more precise term, to simply vibe. It could be the cozy corner of a cafe, a communal park, or even the neighborhood barbershop \u2014 anywhere that\u2019ll allow you to interact with people outside your usual circles.\u00a0\nYet, at many universities like Penn, the concept of a third place seems all but lost as our lives remain restricted to school grounds, causing even our first and second places to converge into one. While spots on campus \u2014 like Stommons, Pret, or the cultural centers in ARCH \u2014 can offer some respite, they often come with the latent pressure of being on the clock. Conversations here revolve around assignments, internships, and the intricacies of Penn culture. The chances of an unexpected encounter dwindle given that most people in attendance will be other Penn students. As we\u2019re cocooned in the Penn bubble, it comes as no surprise that many students spend their four years in Philadelphia without ever fully exploring it.\u00a0\n\tYet, this insulation comes at a cost that extends far beyond what we realize.\u00a0\nIt severs our connection not only from the outside world but also from ourselves. That is, within such limits, our individuality dwindles, reducing us to mere roles influenced by our peers. By excluding ourselves from a wider social sphere, we inhibit opportunities to engage with diverse perspectives, trap ourselves in a cycle of familiarity, and risk leading monotonous lives that pave the way to burnout.\nHowever, in our lives, both intimacy and affiliation with broader communities are essential. While intimacy often stems from our immediate circles, affiliation thrives in third places where spontaneous interactions occur. These spaces facilitate easy contact with new individuals on a regular basis, without the need for prior scheduling. As they consistently offer an opportunity for interaction with others, they end up cultivating the most reliable form of socialization.\u00a0\nSo, if you are keen on exploring new horizons and getting involved in the Philadelphia community, I suggest checking out the many informative articles dedicated to bursting the Penn bubble.\nNevertheless, I want to avoid confining third places to physical locations. They\u2019re more of a mindset, a willingness to embrace spontaneity wherever it may arise. They don't have to be far from campus or require spending money. Instead, third places can be any informal spots you visit \u2014 whether it's your student lounge, the library, or a community center.\u00a0\n\t\tGet our newsletter, DP Daybreak, delivered to your inbox every weekday morning.We often find ourselves caught up in the routines of daily life, clinging to familiar patterns of scheduling and social interaction.

          "title": "Beatriz B\u00e1ez | No closed captioning available",
          "article_content": "Columnist Beatriz B\u00e1ez explains her experience with language fatigue at Penn.On my first day at Penn, I called my father in distress, telling him I needed to move back home and study there as I was going to die alone at this university. My father asked why, and I quickly responded, \u201cI haven\u2019t met anybody in three hours. I have no friends. It\u2019s over for me.\u201d\u00a0\nThat very same night, I went to a New Student Orientation event at Houston Hall. As I nervously paced the floor in my Crocs, I overheard some students speaking Spanish and immediately gravitated toward them. Confessing, \u201cI heard Spanish, and I feel saved,\u201d I ended up meeting three genuine individuals, all from various parts of Latin America. Having arrived in the United States, it felt comforting to hear voices that reminded me of home. This comfort is priceless in such a foreign environment.\n\t\tAll my life, I\u2019ve taken courses in Spanish, spoken Spanish at home, and been berated by my grandmother whenever I spoke too much English. Arriving at Penn, I didn\u2019t anticipate the struggle I would face taking classes taught in English, as I had been lucky enough to have been extensively taught English from a very young age.\nBut speaking in a second language most of the time, even as a fluent speaker, is incredibly draining. Meeting native Spanish speakers at Penn was truly a blessing. However, I have found that some people react adversely to me speaking my primary language. These are not continuous reactions of a high degree, but there have been enough small instances to mark me.\u00a0\n\t\t\t\tMORE ON THIS TOPIC:Students celebrate 40th annual Festival Latinx, honoring Latinx culture on campusLa Casa Latina celebrates 2023 Latinx Heritage Month at PennOn various occasions, I have had Latinx friends say, \u201cLet\u2019s speak English so X person doesn\u2019t feel excluded,\u201d or even resort to English for \u201cconvenience\u201d when we\u2019re alone. For the former, I understand the sentiment. I wouldn\u2019t want someone to be excluded from a conversation in such a way. However, when I\u2019m naturally speaking Spanish, having my speech interpreted as a personal offense is off-putting.\u00a0\nIn one instance, I met a student through a mutual friend on a night out. This friend and I speak fluent Spanish; the person I had just met did not. Throughout the night, I had various conversations with my new acquaintance \u2014 who I found quite amicable \u2014 and my friend. I would naturally speak Spanish with the latter, not thinking much of it. The next morning, my friend told me how the new acquaintance felt I hated them for speaking Spanish in front of them, knowing they didn\u2019t speak the language.\u00a0\n\tI was shocked by the assumption and, in all honesty, a little offended. I found it quite conceited that one would think another person is speaking in their first language to actively exclude them. Speaking in a first language, for me, is purely a relief issue. Although I am fluent in English, after an entire week of speaking it, it can be extremely draining; thus, particularly in a social setting, I don\u2019t want to add to the exhaustion.\u00a0\nIt is more than fine to be curious about what somebody is saying and ask for a translation. However, immediately expressing discomfort upon hearing another language and presuming the other person is talking badly about you is inconsiderate toward them. More often than not, this language switch is for comfort. This was the first of sufficient instances that exposed a pattern in my time at Penn. In another class, I grew close to a few other Spanish-speaking students. One of them continuously suggested we switch back to English for seemingly no valid reason and would reply to any comment of mine in English.\u00a0\nThis harsh reality on campus expands into the club scene. In one instance, a native English speaker attended a club meeting primarily led in Spanish. Within this meeting, if club members asked questions in Spanish, any other members who answered quickly switched to English. Evidently, the intent is to have everybody be able to partake in conversation. However, members within a Spanish-led group should be able to detach from English formalities within club meetings, particularly if the club seeks to embrace Latinx heritage.\u00a0\nSpeaking in my primary language is the greatest manifestation of my culture, particularly since Spanish accents are so diverse throughout Latin America. Having to switch to English not only in academic settings but in seemingly every other sphere of Penn life further disconnects me from the culture I\u2019ve been surrounded by my entire life until now. This applies to any person whose main language isn\u2019t English, not only to Spanish speakers.\u00a0\n\t\tGet our newsletter, DP Daybreak, delivered to your inbox every weekday morning.Penn has students from over 100 countries, with around 19% of the student body being international. If one truly wants to immerse themselves in Penn\u2019s multilingual community, one needs to recognize that a language barrier works both ways. Just as an English speaker may be tired from learning another language, a non-English speaker can be drained from constantly speaking English. It\u2019s crucial to recognize that for the latter, multilingualism surpasses a simple language requirement and spills over to nearly every sector of their life at Penn.\u00a0\nLanguage fatigue is a true reality, especially for individuals who haven\u2019t learned English from a young age. Thus, if somebody within your social group is speaking their first language, which you are not fluent in, it does not give you the right to feel offended or urge them to speak in a tongue you understand. And, if you are a non-native English speaker, as much as you can, \"habla en tu primer idioma y que los dem\u00e1s se ubiquen.\"\nBEATRIZ B\u00c1EZ is a College first year studying mathematics and political science from San Juan, Puerto Rico.

And, if white is a moral choice, there is an enormous challenge: then you're challenging an entire civilization,\u201d said James Baldwin.\nWhiteness is the myth we\u2019ve been sold and under which we live. In our instruction at the University of Pennsylvania, we were told to reach for safety and to secure our decadence. So are the students now, but they are not nearly as certain that this is the road they\u2019d really like to walk. The students I knew have already paid that price for that ticket, and their horizons, on a human level, look bleak.\u00a0\n\t\tPhiladelphia is not a college town.

From the soil of this city rose heroes like Teddy Pendergrass, The Delfonics, McCoy Tyner, and Alfie Pollitt.

Students are developing a new language in order to deal with existential questions: What is the purpose of education and the responsibility of students in the wake of war? More than in my time, it is now clear that we, the students, want to be free. The crisis is deepening, and history is accelerating.\n\t\t\n\t\nFewer illusions are possible for the young mind in Philadelphia, which tempers and sharpens it like metal on metal. What the path to whiteness and an invented safety then produces is a delusional and unfree state. My peers, who are banking, coding, and consulting their lives away, are living as prisoners to the choices they\u2019ve made.\u00a0\nAll the beauty, genius, and potential I witnessed when we were young together, freshman year before the vicious teeth of Penn successfully \u201csocialized\u201d most of us, has been wasted, whittled down into dust, and lost.

The scramble for acceptance into mediocre clubs and fraternities is insufferable, and the false authority these groups stand on in order to make these judgments is embarrassing.

          "title": "Hanadi Abdulkadir | How poor dining hall food shapes our mental and academic capabilities",
          "article_content": "At this point, many Penn students have lived the terrible dining stories at a number of halls across campus. While it\u2019s important to discuss the health and sanitary risks associated with some of these concerns, it\u2019s also necessary to break down how this problem factors into students\u2019 academic and mental well-being.\u00a0\nOpening Sidechat every few days to see yet another picture of undercooked meat or hearing horror stories from my friends dissuades me from trekking across campus to eat at many of our dining halls. Oftentimes, I find myself skipping meals or stretching the time out between each one \u2014 until I accept the fact that I\u2019ll be eating the same food I already ate a couple times that week. Does this mean that I\u2019m probably missing out on some of the necessary vitamins or fiber I should be getting daily? Probably.\n\t\tNumerous Penn Dining Wellness emails live in our inboxes with tips on improving digestive health and practicing better healthy habits in our daily lives. Additionally, the official page for Penn Dining boasts awards and recognitions for sustainability and top college dining. However, the pristine and glossy promotional pictures of sandwiches, smoothies, and breakfast bowls tell a completely different story from the reality on campus.\nWith two of the most historical repeat offenders \u2014 Hill House and 1920 Commons \u2014 being the only consistent options available for on campus dining during the weekend, it\u2019s much more convenient to resort to the other retail spots scattered around campus. However, some of these locations are far apart, depending on where you live, and can add additional costs to weekly expenses. \u00a0\n\t\t\t\tSEE MORE FROM HANADI ABDULKADIR:\ufeffPenn should require an African American history courseWhy social media and Palestinian activism goes hand in handAdditionally, for students who are dishing out a hefty sum of money to enroll in the dining plan, going out of their way to seek expensive alternatives takes away money that could\u2019ve been better spent elsewhere. Considering that first years and sophomores are required to pick a dining plan for their first two years at Penn, it\u2019s no wonder that students have consistently called for the food standards to match the high prices of these meal swipes. Ideally, no student should feel like they need to resort to options outside of Penn; rather, outside options should be supplemental to an already quality level of options at all dining halls.\u00a0\nSince coming to Penn, my relationship with food has become much more complex. I need to look twice when picking out a seemingly clean utensil to eat whatever is on my plate or stare extra hard at my salad with suspicion before consuming it. But growing up, food was always a way for me to connect with my family and friends, to bring us back together even when we hadn\u2019t seen each other in a long time. Yet the food at Penn, at its worst, has left me frustrated and succeeded at suppressing my appetite \u2014 something I actually can relate to other students about.\n\tAlthough certain foods are scientifically linked to improving mental clarity and focus, I hesitate in reaching for those vegetables because they don\u2019t look as fresh or appetizing when lined up on display in Kings Court English House. As a result, I look for short-term solutions in coffee, which leaves me feeling tired earlier in the day or exhausted while trying to tackle my assignments at night. In order to meet my immediate deadlines, I prioritize some assignments over others, meaning some classes suffer in academic performance and perpetuate an almost never-ending cycle of playing catch-up. I believe that the root cause of all these problems can be traced back to the lack of decent dining.\u00a0\nThis same sentiment has been echoed by many of my friends and peers. But the dining quality at Penn can be mitigated if the University addresses the root problem. Whether that be promoting clean and sanitary workspaces when handling food or streamlining student complaints to Penn Dining other than through email, the University can restore student faith in the system. When it comes to campus dining, Penn can improve upon our experiences by implementing the changes that students deserve to enjoy, especially at the height of midterm season.\nHANADI ABDULKADIR is a College sophomore studying international relations from Philadelphia.

          "article_content": "During Penn\u2019s recent administrative upheaval, the University community found an unexpected silver lining: For the first time, Penn was making headlines alongside Harvard and MIT.\u00a0\nThe presidents of these three institutions were at the center of an infamous congressional hearing in December after their alleged missteps on campus antisemitism. I\u2019ll admit, there is something far more distasteful about chaos at the Capitol than the collective HYPSM prestige.\n\t\tBut many of us are taking our education at Penn for granted, shedding our \u201cque ser\u00e1, ser\u00e1\u201d optimism, and wondering at times what it would be like to go to a more recognizable Ivy. For decades, we\u2019ve all but exhausted our morale by clarifying to passersby that no, Penn State and Penn are not the same university. And yes, Penn is actually active in areas outside of Wharton\u2019s finance programs.\nSo, when Penn Engineering announced its new undergraduate program in artificial intelligence, many of us were enthusiastic about the University\u2019s growing role in the innovation sector: a space thought to be dominated by less business-oriented institutions.\n\t\t\t\tSEE MORE FROM MRITIKA SENTHIL: Removing legacy admissions will align Penn\u2019s actions more closely with its educational missionWhy changing leadership won\u2019t eliminate antisemitism at PennBut Penn\u2019s realization, of possibly its most practical initiative, begs the question: Is the University actually necessary in DevOps? Does sitting in a classroom \u2014 let alone one that\u2019s in the midst of a campus known for its influx of finance bros \u2014 really supersede what can be MacGyvered by a tech junkie with only a laptop, caffeine, and time? I want to give a definite \u201cno.\u201d Otherwise, I would need to hold my classmates and myself accountable for upholding all the exclusivity that comes with attending Penn. And yet, there are a frustrating number of anonymous netizens, D-list journalists, and LinkedIn bards who call Ivy League universities like Penn \u201cout of touch\u201d \u2014 remnants of centuries-old American elitism in an era of bottom-up grassroots movements.\nOne C-suite executive anticipates that \u201cthe best AI engineers and builders won\u2019t graduate Penn Engineering. They'll be global, builders and in the right group chats.\u201d His readers agree, with one commenter further emphasizing that \u201cuniversities cannot keep up with the pace of free market innovation.\u201d When these schools attempt to go against the grain and align with consumer needs, \u201cit genuinely looks embarrassing and out of date.\u201d\n\tIn an environment where the use of AI models is largely democratized, we\u2019re naturally drawn to the trope of a layperson who forgoes bureaucratic systems to channel their intelligence: creating life-changing inventions that would have never come to be under self-serving corporate and political influences. And when ignoring cases of succor \u2014 as mainstream media unfortunately does \u2014 there are many examples of such successes. Bill Gates and Paul Allen, co-founders of Microsoft, were university dropouts. So were Meta Platforms co-founders Mark Zuckerberg and Dustin Moskovitz. As Penn\u2019s over reliance on donors came to light earlier this school year, critics of the upper crust have continued to group Penn with other perpetrators of social stratification. The field of AI is, by nature, continuously evolving. And limiting growth in the discipline to those who can afford, and then succeed in Penn\u2019s Department of Computer and Information Science courses is counterproductive.\nHowever, these narratives misrepresent the intentions of Penn\u2019s AI program.\nTo make a better case for Penn\u2019s AI major, I spoke with Robert Ghrist, Andrea Mitchell Professor and associate dean for undergraduate education at Penn Engineering. He describes how the process of integrating AI in education is similar to the effects of increasing access to music recording and playback technologies. Now, there is \u201cmore music for everyone at much lower prices,\u201d he told me. Nonetheless, \u201cartists at the very top of the industry\u201d are increasingly the benefactors of \u201ca concentration of rewards.\u201d Taylor Swift is, as any current news feed can attest to, perhaps the most prolific embodiment of such phenomena. And professor Ghrist strives to make Penn an incubator of sorts for the \u201cTaylor Swifts of AI\u201d that seek avenues for academic growth, to actually be the \u201cleading edge where the best thrive.\u201d\nAnd to thrive in this discipline, aspiring AI mavens are off course by simply memorizing browser instructions in JavaScript and praying for a tech equivalent of the coveted Goldman Sachs internship. After all, studying AI is a philosophical pursuit: an inquiry into the nature of consciousness and ethics of creating sentient machines. It\u2019s also a political pursuit, for AI poses challenges in regulatory compliance. There are countless possible liabilities for even the most basic ChatGPT input, such as unprotected user data and violations of intellectual property rights. \u00a0\n\t\tGet our newsletter, DP Daybreak, delivered to your inbox every weekday morning.Needless to say, as you might have noticed in my earlier columns, I am not an AI major. I\u2019m not even enrolled in Penn Engineering. Am I, of all students, in the right to quash critics of the Penn AI major when I dropped AP Computer Science in high school (with no regrets)?\nYet, it\u2019s clearly irresponsible to follow the well-intentioned advice from tech capitalists when constant innovation is not particularly ideal for society. Maybe I\u2019m just afraid of a \"Black Mirror\"-esque dystopia, but there is a kind of ominous quality to the idea of highly skilled AI scientists off the reins. Penn, however, is cultivating an ecosystem that nurtures AI talent, albeit not by stifling the next Elon Musk or Sam Altman with red-tape-ridden academics; instead, Penn fosters ethically conscious innovation that addresses complex societal challenges. And so, the fact that I can engage with the Penn curricula across departments has a surprising beauty. The opportunity to become a part of this technological movement \u2014 or, dare I say, revolution \u2014 is the gift of studying AI at Penn.\nMRITIKA SENTHIL is a first year studying management and Russian and east European studies from Columbia, S.C.

          "title": "Akiva Berkowitz | An AI major by any other name ",
          "article_content": "Artificial intelligence is a topic we can\u2019t seem to get enough of. From frequent announcements regarding policies within classrooms to endless professors and visiting scholars weighing in on the unprecedented effect large language models will have on our lives, I\u2019m sure we\u2019ve all discussed to death how revolutionary ChatGPT has become for college students.\u00a0\nMany of us have even had the chance to firmly establish positions on whether the University should embrace the technology wholeheartedly or put in place safeguards to prevent it from eroding the value of a college education, but up until now, the vast majority of conversations have been on a non-technical level.\n\t\tThat all potentially changed in this past month when Penn announced their first Bachelor of Science in Engineering in AI. Thankfully for us, Penn has chosen to launch this interdisciplinary degree at the \u201coptimal time\u201d to \u201ccreate a society where AI isn\u2019t just a tool, but a fundamental force for good to advance society.\u201d But at what cost? To what extent should we be using college as an opportunity to hyperfocus on not just a certain field (computer science), but a field within a field? Majoring in AI panders to the pre-professionalism Penn is known for and removes many of the foundational elements of the field that underlie innovation.\u00a0\nIn an interesting recent LinkedIn post, David Magerman pondered the implications of a university building complete undergraduate curriculums around a \u201cmodern business tool that is a niche application of computer science, diverting students away from a broad education in computer science.\u201d He went on to ask pointedly, \u201cWhat's next? A Bachelor of Arts in Blogging from the Annenberg School? A Wharton BS in Quantitative Trading?\u201d\n\t\t\t\tSEE MORE FROM AKIVA BERKOWITZ:The newsletter is dead\ufeffIsrael under attack: What do you stand for?As a current computer science major, I\u2019ll admit the AI curriculum looks fascinating. There is such an array of eye-catching electives (from Deep Generative Models to Natural Language Processing) that, if I were doing my degree all over again, I suspect I would have been swayed to switch into the major. But as a recently graduated computer and information science friend put it, the degree \u201cseems like the cool parts of CIS\u201d without the heavier basics like operating systems, computer systems, and physics \u2014 building blocks on the entire computer domain. \u00a0\nThe question I ask myself is whether artificial intelligence is really enough of an independent field that it transcends computer science and necessitates its own major. Is the relatively new field of AI established enough, broad enough, and unique enough such that the skills we gain through taking just those mostly career-focused courses today will undoubtedly remain relevant in 30 years and justify the $84,600 a year sticker price? I simply wonder how likely it may be that AI will become so unrecognizable in 20 or even 10 years, given its breakneck pace of innovation, that students may have wished that their majors in college focused on more fundamental elements of the field that innovators keep turning back to for insight.\u00a0\n\tAside from long-term career effectiveness an AI degree would have compared to computer science or electrical engineering, Penn is known for its pre-professional student body, and this new major shows signs of that sentiment leaking into the curriculum as well. In contrast to the Penn Integrates Knowledge professorships that bring in academic leaders who deeply understand multiple fields to better spark insight between them, this new major filters various courses of study to pluck out the elements we find valuable today.\u00a0\nIn this line of thinking, maybe we should consider the true value of a groundbreaking Wharton degree in quant trading that would promise to \u201csculpt the financial moguls of tomorrow\u201d with unparalleled prowess in algorithmic trading strategies and quantitative analysis.\u00a0\nAll this is to say, I immediately understand the value the current AI concentration within the larger CIS curriculum has. And I appreciate the Ph.D. programs that take students to a higher level of understanding, once they\u2019ve taken the time in their undergraduate training to build the broad foundations. I simply remain curious of the true value an AI undergraduate degree offers us as students over other forms of study within the field and the certain level of indulgence in pre-professionalism that it plays into on Penn\u2019s campus. I truly hope that I\u2019m proven wrong.\nAKIVA BERKOWITZ is an Engineering junior studying computer science from Silver Spring, Md.

          "article_content": "As busy college students, most of us do not have time to cook our own meals, and if you are anything like me, cooking is far from your forte. The hassle of having to go to the grocery store, cook, and clean can be time consuming and even more difficult when you\u2019re overwhelmed with classes, clubs, and homework. For the many students without access to a kitchen in their dorm, this presents an even bigger challenge. Luckily, college campuses have dining halls! Students simply swipe their card to get access to an all-you-care-to-eat dining experience. Dining halls provide easy access meals to students\u2014but what happens when that food is inedible?\nAs a picky eater, I know that simply because I do not like a dish does not mean it is unsafe to eat, but food with cockroaches and glass is unsafe for anyone. A seemingly obvious underlying assumption in dining is that food is safe to eat. College dining halls should be a place where students go to eat well-cooked, hairless, and insect-free food. However, that is not the case at Penn: There is a lack of responsibility to make sure the food is meeting basic standards for, let alone satisfying, all students.\u00a0\n\t\tMeal plans are far from cheap. For the sticker price, students would expect quality food, but they would be wrong. Both of the first-year student meal plan options cost $6,330, with the maximum amount of swipes being 296. Each meal swipe equates to roughly $17, which is about the same price as a Caniac Combo at Raising Cane's. As previously stated, Penn dining hall food is far from gourmet, and its price is too high for the quality delivered.\u00a0\nExpensive dining plan meals are not unique to Penn, but other Ivy League schools have similar prices for better quality food. Cornell University offers an unlimited meal plan, so students may visit the dining halls as much as they want with a fixed cost of $6,942 for food ranked second-best in the nation. So, for roughly 600 more dollars, Cornell students have access to unlimited meals and substantially better quality dining.\u00a0\n\t\t\t\tSEE MORE FROM ERIC NAJERA: \ufeffWe should be grateful to attend PennPenn clubs should have an assigned faculty member\ufeffAside from price and quality, weekend dining is another struggle. With the popular McClelland Sushi & Market and Houston Market being closed on Saturdays and the other dining halls closing at 8 p.m., food options are limited. Late-night study sessions means having to resort to local food places that remain open, and unlike nearby schools such as Drexel, our dining dollars do not work at off-campus restaurants and out-of-pocket money spent on takeout can add up quickly.\nBefore every school break, Sidechat is flooded with posts of excitement for home-cooked meals. In my classes, when asked what we are excited for, most students reply being able to eat good food. It is not uncommon for college students to miss their home-cooked meals, but when students are excited to actually eat food that is not served alongside insects, it signifies a problem.\n\tWith Penn\u2019s Bon App\u00e9tit contract still in place, we may not know how much Penn can do to change the dining experience. Safe, clean food should not be an unreasonable expectation. In order to enhance a student's experience outside the classroom, Penn must budget for an edible food experience for all students.\nERIC NAJERA is a College sophomore studying history from Rolling Meadows, Ill.

          "article_content": "We all know the typical \u201ctypes\u201d of high schoolers, the different clich\u00e9s: Where are my nerds at? But, another attribute of student groups that has become increasingly relevant in the 21st century United States is the diverse ethnic makeup of its population. And, frankly, do we as a campus mirror all that comes with that national trend of diversity?\nThink of the friends with whom you often hang out. Then, ask those friends with whom they usually go out. Finally, think of the groups you are a part of, the extracurriculars in which you partake. Notice a pattern?\n\t\t\u201c[D]espite increased opportunity to live and work in mixed-race settings, Americans remain racially segregated in their friendship patterns,\u201d a study published by the National Institutes of Health found. \u201cSpatial racism, cultural encapsulation, and personal choice are contributing factors for patterns of same-race friendships.\u201d\u00a0\nThis pattern seems to reflect the divisions present in Penn\u2019s social scene as well. Despite coming from all sorts of backgrounds across the world, the University\u2019s students appear to have unconsciously adopted a policy of self segregation. In other words, we like to \u201cstick to our own\u201d by socializing with others to whom we relate to on a cultural, ethnic, or religious basis. So, regardless of Penn\u2019s efforts to integrate people of differing experiences and beliefs, there still remains a degree of resistance by individuals themselves to cross those racial or cultural lines.\n\t\t\n\t\nAs a result, the potential for diversity of thought is threatened. A narrow mindset develops within these groups that students pledge to, and they effectively act as echo chambers that exacerbate already crippling political polarization. We relate to each other less, rely on our \u201cown\u201d more, and become less tolerant of the views, and thus experiences, of those who do not necessarily look, think, or speak like us.\nThis kind of thinking \u2014 whether manifested in the form of race, religion, or otherwise \u2014 has led to serious tension at times and enabled a distorted view of certain communities and how they experience Penn. I attribute part of that thinking not to the identity groups we are a part of, but to how much we value them over who we are as individuals.\n\tHomogenous communities definitely have their place in the college experience: They help ease our transition when we first arrive at Penn, and their role cannot be replaced. I say this as an international student myself, who had a hard time acclimating to an entirely different culture and, most radically, diet. Nonetheless, we should treat these organizations as an aid to finding belonging on campus, not a substitute for individual thought and expression.\nHowever, none of this means individuals can\u2019t agree or always need to separate themselves from the group. The use of a large, collective voice can benefit our campus much more than we realize. What is important to note is that there lies a clear distinction between acknowledging the views of others and forcing ourselves to accept those views for the sake of conformity.\nThere is nothing wrong with disagreeing with the majority, whether it is one against two or one against a nation (though some may try to tell you otherwise). As long as you are respectful and driven by a desire to learn rather than defend, there are no limits on what perspective you may question. So, challenge your beliefs, reevaluate your viewpoint, challenge that of others (no matter who they are), and then reevaluate yourself again. It\u2019ll be hard at first, to express your precise, genuine thoughts without fear. But, remember that you\u2019re not alone (I struggle sometimes myself) and that it\u2019s a process you won\u2019t always get right.\n\t\tGet our newsletter, DP Daybreak, delivered to your inbox every weekday morning.The hardest part of breaking out of groupthink, after realizing it, is talking about it. My advice? Take the plunge and never look back. The next time you are in a group and the majority agrees with an idea you don\u2019t like, let it be known. Talk about it and explain why you think the way you do. Don\u2019t worry if some get offended or others simply do not agree; it is normal and, in fact, expected.\u00a0\nNever forget that disputes you engage in are an opportunity, not a challenge, and our differences are enlightening, not threatening. Only then will we begin to understand and appreciate each other more as unique actors in a truly historic community.\nZAID ALSUBAIEI is a College first year studying economics from Al-Khobar, Saudi Arabia.

          "article_content": "I downloaded Sidechat this fall after my friends sent me too many screenshots of funny memes or jokes posted on the anonymous app. I figured that doing so would simply remove the middleman. I was already being exposed to the same jokes, memes, comments and judgements as those on the app anyway \u2026 right?\u00a0\nIn December, I returned home for reading days and fell into an easy pattern of studying. Nothing I did was wildly exciting or social, but I instead found myself enjoying the routine and satisfaction of productivity. During my study breaks, I would scroll on Sidechat \u2014 and from the comfort of my home, I felt myself spiraling into anxious dread about returning to Penn. Each time I opened the app, I was faced with a barrage of posts all echoing the same sentiment: Penn is awful and depressing. Without a second thought, I accepted those posts as fact, and in doing so, I allowed Sidechat to have more power than it deserves. In other words, I subscribed to the complaining culture that is pervasive on Sidechat.\u00a0\n\t\tUsing Sidechat, especially without intentional thought, is a way of looking at Penn through hypercritical glasses. Perhaps this is because negativity has been normalized and cynicism gets more upvotes. To some extent, this pessimistic messaging is diluted with the insertion of mildly entertaining memes or jokes, but the result is still the same. With each scroll, Sidechat is perpetuating a defeatist perspective of Penn.\u00a0\nSo, I arrived back at Penn to take my final exam: openly unhappy about returning to what I thought would be a bleak campus as a result of discourse on Sidechat. But to my surprise, it was not horrific, and I was able to enjoy my weekend of studying just as I had my week at home. The sheer volume of disheartening posts on Sidechat had clouded my perspective and ability to see the best in the situation. Sure, I was becoming one with a Huntsman GSR while others were at home enjoying break, but on the other hand, I was with my friends and able to have a sleepy campus all to myself.\n\t\t\t\tAs is the case with most other social media platforms, Sidechat is consumed passively and without a second thought \u2014 it\u2019s used to pass time, curb boredom, and satiate our addictions to our phones. And yet, students are absorbing and internalizing content more quickly than they can truly digest it.\u00a0\nGiven the bandwagon culture on Sidechat, users often build off of one another, creating a chaotic, and often dismal, echo chamber that does not truly represent life at Penn. Whether or not college is the best four years of your life, it is at least what you make of it, and Sidechat enables students to feel like victims of an unknown cause. For those who are actually struggling, Sidechat acts not as a productive outlet, but rather as a meta ether that provides no remedy other than the satisfaction that others are unhappy too.\u00a0\n\tSince winter break, I have in fact deleted Sidechat and am all the better for it. I still get sent the best and the brightest jokes by my friends, but I am no longer overwhelmed by unsolicited complaints on an hourly basis. Without Sidechat, my thoughts on the housing lottery, the floods in the Quad, and upcoming midterms are completely my own. Deleting Sidechat may not be for everyone, but it\u2019s imperative for those who chose to use Sidechat to take a more critical view of what is being circulated and evaluate whether or not they are benefiting from it. It may just change the way they see Penn.\u00a0\nELIZA CARROLL is a College first year studying international relations and art history from Greenwich, Conn.

          "article_content": "Students for the Preservation of Chinatown protested outside the Board of Trustees meeting held at the Inn at Penn on Mar. 3, 2023. \nA few weeks ago, the streets of Chinatown came to life with firecrackers and lion dances ringing in the year of the dragon. As you walk through the brightly colored 40-foot paifang \u2014 known to most as Chinatown\u2019s Friendship Gate \u2014 you enter into a cultural oasis that has stood strong in the heart of Philadelphia for nearly 150 years. Beyond this fixture, Chinatown serves as a home to nearly 3,000 residents and numerous family-owned businesses, restaurants, shops, and community organizations. Whether you are going to Ken\u2019s Seafood Restaurant for a fun night out or Heng Fa for groceries, Chinatown feels like home.\u00a0\nUnfortunately, this community has been under constant attack for decades and is once again facing the threat of displacement and gentrification from a plan to develop an arena for the Philadelphia 76ers merely a block away. We firmly stand with the Students for the Preservation of Chinatown and urge you to do the same. \u00a0\n\t\tSince the early 1900s, Chinatown has been a victim of gentrification often driven by predatory infrastructure projects. In 1932, the construction of subway infrastructure at Ridge and Eighth streets \u2014 and the subsequent development of the Vine Street Expressway from 1957 to 1991 \u2014 resulted in the destruction of buildings and severe divisions within the community. Bringing in noise and pollution, the expressway eroded neighborhoods and people's quality of life. This was not Chinatown's sole battle, however, as it also faced multiple proposals of developments for a federal prison in 1992, a baseball stadium in 2000, and a casino in 2008.\u00a0\nThe story of Philadelphia's Chinatown mirrors other Chinatowns across the nation. Amid the 1994 fiscal crisis in Washington, D.C., then-Washington Wizards owner Abe Pollin negotiated a deal for the downtown Capital One Arena, where the city covered pre-development costs to acquire and demolish properties. Entrepreneurs in Washington's Chinatown voiced concerns about prices of real estate skyrocketing and parking impacts on businesses in the area. A decade later, most Chinese residents were forced to move out due to unaffordable housing. The parking shortage led to the closure of the last Chinese grocery store, accelerating the decline of the Chinese American population in the area to fewer than 400 residents today. Ironically, as D.C.\u2019s arena now relocates to the suburbs, the community is left behind, having endured irreversible destruction while in the midst of its recovery from the pandemic.\u00a0\n\t\t\t\tMORE FROM LIALA SOFI AND CATHY LI:Liala Sofi | The hypocrisy of billionaire philanthropistsCathy Li | Philadelphia\u2019s changing tastesIn New York\u2019s Chinatown, threats of displacement and economic insecurity also loom high. In 2021, the Museum of Chinese in America accepted a donation of $35 million in support of a borough-based jail complex which would displace Chinese American working-class people in the area. On top of that, its board executives were connected to the closing of the last unionized restaurant, beloved Jing Fong banquet hall, and construction of luxury towers that are actively raising rent and real estate taxes in the area.\nIn Philadelphia, the current 76Place project is being developed by 76 DevCo, an initiative by 76ers managing partners Josh Harris, David Blitzer, and David Adelman. Adelman is at the forefront of the construction of the arena and has promised not to displace the residents or businesses in Chinatown, but his past actions speak louder than his current words. Adelman works closely with Brett Altman, who also owns the University City Townhomes, and was a key figure behind the demolition and end of affordable housing in the West Philadelphia area that was previously known as the \"Black Bottom.\u201d This constant cycle of displacing residents and communities that have lived in the area for generations must end, and we must be the voice to make this happen.\n\tDevelopers of the project have stated that the arena will \u201cserve as a model for an equitable & inclusive community,\u201d yet there is not a single mention of Chinatown in the proposal. Efforts to ensure communities can benefit from this project read as empty promises when nearly 95% of residents, business owners, and visitors oppose the arena\u2019s construction.\nMany questions posed by residents have also gone unanswered by 76 DevCo. How will restaurants and small businesses in the surrounding area be protected? Who will clean the streets after huge events?\u00a0\nPreserving Philadelphia's architectural heritage demands careful consideration in urban development, but the development of the arena does the exact opposite \u2014 jeopardizing accessible low-income and senior housing complexes, healthcare clinics, and schools for children.\nPenn has direct ties to the developers in the area, and students should be cognizant of the situation. Adelman currently sits on Penn Medicine Board of Trustees and is the CEO of Campus Apartments, which houses many Penn students off-campus. But more importantly, Penn students are directly and indirectly involved in the Chinatown community, whether that be Penn Lions performing all throughout the city for Lunar New Year, or student groups like SPOC organizing initiatives to honor traditions celebrating the multi-ethnic communities that reside there.\u00a0\nDespite what greedy developers may suggest, Chinatown is not an ethnic theme park but a home. It\u2019s more than just a place to eat, it\u2019s a support network and a cultural hub for immigrants and visitors alike.\nIn the face of ongoing threats, Chinatown has demonstrated remarkable resilience and activism, advocating for the needs of all diverse communities of color that are integrated into the cultural fabric of our city. The next time you are in Chinatown, take a look around at all the place has to offer. Venture into Ebisu for some home decor and enjoy a Mochinut donut as you shop. Come by Dae Bak for soul-nourishing Korean barbecue. The opportunities to support your favorite restaurants and local businesses are endless.\nPlease don't turn a blind eye to what is happening outside the Penn bubble. Pay attention to what SPOC and other organizers are doing in the fight for the preservation of Chinatown. Educate yourself on what is going on in Chinatowns across the country. If you can, participate in programming like Crane Chinatown Community Center art exhibitions or Show Your Love for Chinatown events to learn more about the challenges facing the neighborhood. Sign petitions. \u00a0\nAdorned with dragon motifs, and gorgeous ornamental roof tiles, the Friendship Archway is not only an architectural masterpiece, but a labor of love \u2014\u00a0created for community by community. The engineers and artisans from Tianjin, China \u2014 Philadelphia\u2019s sister city \u2014 came together with residents and the city of Philadelphia to fund and invest in Chinatown, and you should too.\u00a0\nThe next time you walk through the gate, remember that the fight for Philadelphia\u2019s Chinatown, and Chinatowns everywhere, is not over. Speak up and fight for the movement so that history does not repeat itself.\nMore resources:\nGoFundMe for Ginger Arts Center\nAsian Arts Initiative\nGet our newsletter, DP Daybreak, delivered to your inbox every weekday morning.Youth Against Displacement\nLIALA SOFI is a College junior from Roanoke, Va.

          "title": "Caroline Magdolen | \u201cEveryone cheats.\u201d What can we do about it?",
          "article_content": "My guess is that nearly everyone reading this article knows someone who has been academically disingenuous, or been that someone before. Being academically dishonest isn\u2019t all about flashy examples, like the two admitted Penn students accused of plagiarism and fabricating data in 2022. There are smaller violations that may feel less egregious, or even harmless, like querying ChatGPT for help completing your homework, peeking at a friend\u2019s lab assignment, or answering a PollEverywhere as if you\u2019re in class, when really, you\u2019re snoozing in your dorm.\nAcademic dishonesty is having a moment in the spotlight. The advent of generative AI, the use of which cannot be reliably detected by grading softwares, will likely upend student learning for better or worse. At the same time, examples of plagiarism by prominent academics are being dug up left and right. The former president of Harvard, Claudine Gay, was ousted in part due to plagiarism concerns, and Business Insider found that former MIT professor Neri Oxman (the wife of billionaire Bill Ackman, who led the campaign against Gay) \u201cstole sentences and whole paragraphs from Wikipedia, other scholars and technical documents in her academic writing.\u201d\n\t\tTo be clear, I believe that academic dishonesty at Penn \u2014 going against community standards that your professor has explicitly outlined \u2014 is unacceptable, and that we should be doing more to penalize and prevent it.\nNevertheless, we must also acknowledge that academic dishonesty is understandable, in that we can piece together students\u2019 rationales when they do cheat, and even sympathize with them in some cases.\n\t\t\t\tSEE MORE FROM CAROLINE MAGDOLEN:\ufeffThe Rat Kings of PennThere\u2019s no better time for climate education\ufeffTo dissuade academic dishonesty, we employ sayings like, \u201cIt will only hurt you in the long run to cheat,\u201d or \u201cYou\u2019re taking advantage of other students who've completed their work fairly.\u201d This is true in some circumstances. If you\u2019re an aspiring quant and you\u2019re asking ChatGPT to calculate all of the derivatives on your MATH 1400 homework, it\u2019s going to show: First in your exams for the class, then in every math class you take thereafter, and especially in your future career. And if MATH 1400 is curved, your dishonest success capitalizes on the honest failures of others \u2014 not cool.\nBut this is not true in all cases. Jane* was a first year in her spring term when she was taking CIS 1210: Data Structures and Algorithms \u2014 a famously challenging CIS course \u2014 with Rajiv Gandhi, a famously challenging professor.\u00a0\n\tShe cheated on her coding assignment late into the semester, and as per the professor\u2019s policy, received a -300/100 on the submitted homework and zeros on all previously submitted homework, receiving a D as her final grade in the course.\nBut Jane believes that what is more important to her story is not what happened, but why it happened.\u00a0\n\u201cWhat drove me to make a bad decision? Why are [these classes] so infamous? It\u2019s because of notorious policies where you cannot collaborate on many assignments. You are given long problem sets to do, on your own, each week, with desperate students in office hour queues that are two to four hours long. Many times, you will go to the TA and not get a clear answer. It is a profoundly isolating situation, particularly for freshmen just entering college, and that\u2019s what drives well-meaning people to cheat.\u201d\nBased on my conversation with Jane, it seemed that she felt isolated at the time and was struggling to reach out for the support that she needed, both in CIS 1210 and at Penn as a whole. And given the limited support Jane could receive from TAs and her instructor, backtracking her friend\u2019s code felt more conducive to her learning than doing nothing.\nJane expressed a lot of remorse over what happened, and said that she still has a lot of respect for Rajiv, maintaining a good relationship with him to this day. She was also grateful that Rajiv was willing to handle this internally, since a low grade in the class looks better than a formal statement on her transcript, detailing her violation of academic integrity.\n\u201cI deserved to be punished harshly,\u201d Jane said. \u201cBut the collaboration policies of these introductory courses, and the punishment I received, wrecked my self-esteem and my early college experience. I felt that there was no way out.\u201d\nAccording to Jane, Rajiv's philosophy is to \"let go of your grades early: the sooner you stop caring about your GPA and start caring about learning, the better.\" She agrees with this philosophy, especially since he curves his courses generously, but sees this as out of touch with the realities of many Penn students.\nAfter students have prioritized perfecting their grades and resumes (and have been praised for it) in high school, those habits won\u2019t get undone overnight. Even at Penn, there are many institutions and accolades that continue to reward \u201cperfect\u201d performance over pursuing difficult academic disciplines, experimenting, and invariably messing up sometimes.\nFrankly, for a pre-med student in computer science (a track which Jane was considering at the time), the adage that \u201ccheating will hurt you in the long run\u201d skill-wise doesn\u2019t hold much water. The skillset of a future doctor and a software engineer just don\u2019t overlap enough. What can hurt a pre-med in the long run is a low GPA.\nAnd while there are some students for whom projects, internships, and technical interviews will get them a lot further in guaranteeing their success, this is not true for everyone. For many preprofessional students who may want to challenge themselves with a major or minor in CIS, they risk getting shut out of the study altogether.\nWhat frustrates me most about this entire situation is not that such harsh action was taken, but that it appears ineffective in tackling the issue at hand. If a student wanted to cheat, they could just take CIS 1600 or CIS 1210 during a different semester, when a different instructor was in charge and penalties were anecdotally known for being less harsh.\nWhile Jane\u2019s actions were clearly wrong, I can\u2019t help thinking that she was just the unlucky example that had to face the music, and she said as much in our interview: \u201cEveryone cheats in this class. You don\u2019t survive [CIS 1600 or CIS 1210] without talking to people, it just depends on whether you get caught. That doesn\u2019t make cheating okay, but it does mean that we need to rethink how these courses operate.\u201d\nSo, what can we do so that not everyone cheats?\nThis is a complex question, and there is no easy answer. It is crucial that as we frame the issue of academic integrity violations, we look at both the violations themselves and the root motivations that drive them \u2014 these actions are not taking place in a vacuum.\u00a0\nAcademic integrity violations these days are, to an extent, simply easier to commit. ChatGPT has led to a surge in \u201cunfair advantage\u201d violations. And even before generative AI, the pandemic had uprooted our usual test-taking environment. Now that classes are in person again, we no longer need to have take-home or open-Internet exams, but these still persist in some classes, and are easier to cheat on. Penn, given its history of fraudulent alumni, isn\u2019t going to be a place where professors can blindly trust students to refrain from cheating when presented with the option, so professors should take some responsibility for leveling the playing field in the classroom too.\u00a0\nJulie Nettleton, the executive director of Penn\u2019s Center for Community Standards and Accountability (CSA), relayed over email that CSA already works closely with schools and centralized resources at Penn to discuss how to proctor exams, and with faculty to discuss exams, syllabi language, and classroom policies.\nWhat constitutes a violation itself is currently not standard across classes, or even across different sections of the same class. How to handle a concern of academic integrity falls to the professor first \u2014 this is how Jane completed CIS 1210 with a lower grade, rather than a formal sanction from the CSA. It makes sense to delegate this responsibility to professors: It is more efficient than having the CSA handle every case, and professors should have the freedom to decide what constitutes cheating in their classrooms.\nHowever, this does open the door to students deliberately choosing sections of a course with professors that have more relaxed academic integrity policies. Conversely, some professors can be overly harsh, to the point where they are acting unfairly towards their students.\u00a0\nJill*, another student that I interviewed for this article, was falsely accused by her professor of collaborating on her final exam with her peers. At the start of winter break, the professor sent a class-wide email imploring those who worked together on the take-home exam to turn themselves in or have the matter escalated. Jill recalls that for students that turned themselves in, the professor lowered their grades accordingly \u2014 everyone else was reported to the CSA.\nIn the end, Jill\u2019s name was cleared, but she was assigned a case manager that seemed to have assumed she was guilty by default. As the case progressed, many of the details that the professor used to build the case against her appeared superfluous \u2014 for example, she and her friends had all rounded to the same decimal place in their work. Jill suspects that the escalation may have been personal: she had previously asked the professor, on behalf of the class, if he could make changes to his teaching style to facilitate learning.\nIt seems wrong to me that a professor could accuse a student and cause such extensive stress when in the end, Jill turned out to be innocent. It reminded me of some other methods that professors use to catch students cheating, such as Turnitin\u2019s flawed AI detector.\nPart of the solution to rampant academic dishonesty may also lie in expanding our vocabulary to discuss the issue, as John McWhorter pointed out in The New York Times. A class-wide cheating ring, direct plagiarism of original ideas from a paper as one\u2019s own, and copying a line of someone\u2019s code all constitute academic dishonesty, but range broadly in terms of severity and \u201cease of catching.\u201d However, this is rarely reflected in academic integrity policies.\u00a0\nIt can be awkward to suggest that some forms of dishonesty are worse than others, and more awkward still to draw the line between different punishments for different violations, but we must still have these conversations.\u00a0\nWhat should constitute dishonesty at all? When speaking with Jane, she would often circle back to how isolating it was to work alone on her assignments as a first year in introductory computer science courses, particularly as a woman in STEM. Every day, she would walk out of class \u201cfeeling way worse about [her]self.\u201d Now exploring chemistry, physics, and biology courses, she greatly appreciates the change in her academic environment, where students are encouraged to openly collaborate. The grade medians in chemistry are similar to those in CIS (which is to say, not great), but Jane is not as stressed as she was in CIS 1210, since she studies with her friends, and they can struggle and ask for help together.\u00a0\nWhile it was dishonest of Jane to copy code when it was against CIS 1210 policy, perhaps CIS majors and minors would learn more from the course if they were in a more collaborative environment to begin with. Jane has suggested that CIS 1210 should find a middle ground where students can learn from each other, but not be overly reliant on collaboration to perform well on exams.\u00a0\nShe also argues that there should be more opportunities for students to admit to academic dishonesty \u2014 through a friend at Stanford, she heard that at the end of a computer science class, students can select the assignments they have cheated on and receive a negative score on them, or risk facing more uncertain penalties if they are later caught.\u00a0\n\u201cThis policy gives people a second chance to do the right thing, and I do believe that you learn from an experience if you own up to it,\u201d Jane said.\nDeliberations over how best to address academic dishonesty can go on without end, but unfortunately this column must do just that.

          "title": "Jack Lakis | What we can learn from Penn\u2019s college ranking",
          "article_content": "Last fall, a plethora of new results from U.S. News & World Report, Wall Street Journal, and Forbes elevated Penn in their national college rankings. Nearly every list places Penn among the top 10, some going as far as placing the University among the top five. This universal growth resulted from a key change in most of these sources\u2019 metrics: greater consideration given to postgraduate salaries.\nPenn famously has one of the highest-earning alumni bodies in the country. Starting salaries for Penn graduates are often considered the highest in the Ivy League. By mid-career, the average Penn alum is raking in $165,000 annually, while the national average for a college graduate caps out at $74,000.\n\t\tPenn draws a great deal of prestige from its potential to produce high earners, which is a direct result of our school\u2019s preprofessional culture. Nearly 50% of all Penn graduates enter one of two career fields: consulting or finance. This pipeline allows most Penn alumni to matriculate into high-paying jobs shortly after graduation.\nI\u2019m usually a defender of preprofessionalism. It\u2019s crucial that Penn graduates are able to find good jobs, and high salary potential is an immense advantage. But those jobs aren\u2019t everything. Many universities are making gains in rankings and name recognition based on alumni outcomes in public service careers.\n\t\t\t\t\ufeffSEE MORE FROM JACK LAKIS:\ufeffDo we all hate Penn?Staying focused after Magill's resignation\ufeffFor example, Harvard University boasts about its eight presidential alumni. However, when 1968 Wharton graduate Donald Trump was elected president, Penn mostly ignored his history with the school. Given his proximity to controversy and his unconventional political history, Penn\u2019s bump in prestige was limited by Trump\u2019s election. Our second closest claim to the White House is the University\u2019s relationship with President Joe Biden and the opening of the Penn Biden Center. I argue that this is as far as Penn\u2019s ties to the presidency will go. Nowadays, Penn\u2019s laser focus on professional development might repel students who will one day have presidential potential.\nComparable institutions to Penn have high-earning graduates and prestigious placements throughout the government, nonprofit sector, and the advocacy space. For example, Georgetown University feeds graduates into congressional offices and many Fulbright programs. Princeton University also regularly features its flashy roster of graduates in powerful political offices. These universities maintain a strong presence in the private sector but are also actively represented in government positions.\n\tIn these examples, the institution itself sponsors an undergraduate school dedicated to public service. At Georgetown, it\u2019s the School of Foreign Service, while at Princeton the role is filled by the School of Public and International Affairs.\nI propose that Penn follow suit and create a fifth undergraduate school dedicated to public affairs. This new school could absorb Penn\u2019s wildly popular social science programs, like PPE (Philosophy, Politics and Economics), Political Science, and Economics. Currently, most students in these majors are scooped up by consulting firms and investment banks. If these students were given an intentional focus on service and social responsibility, perhaps they could feel empowered to use their degrees in a more meaningful way.\nThe least Penn can do is expand its current effort to bridge the gap between social science degree seekers and careers in government and nonprofits. It\u2019s crucial that our student body actively engages with the robust policy infrastructure that Penn has already made available: Civic House, Perry World House, opportunities like Penn in Washington, and extracurricular engagements offered by the Government and Politics Association. From what I\u2019ve seen, these resources are underutilized at Penn. By snubbing them, Penn students are working against the general interests of the University to gain prestige.\n\t\tGet our newsletter, DP Daybreak, delivered to your inbox every weekday morning.Besides, it's about more than just rankings. We have the potential to empower our students to become leaders in society. TIME Magazine ranks Penn as the third-best college for aspiring leaders. However, the article states its rationale for this placement as a concentration of graduates in business careers. Other chart-topping schools on this list were noted for their programs in law, medicine, and more.\nUltimately, private sector homogeneity marks one of Penn\u2019s key weaknesses. As we move forward, Penn has a duty to educate leaders in more than one field. If Penn strengthened its programs in civic engagement, more graduates would be inclined to pursue roles in government and could elevate Penn\u2019s cultural stature. We should be known for more than salaries. We can do more than business.\nJACK LAKIS is a College first year studying political science from Kennesaw, Ga.

          "title": "Mia Vesely | Black Penn is vibrant this month and every month",
          "article_content": "As of late, most of my columns have focused on things I take issue with: Whether it\u2019s Liz Magill\u2019s resignation and the threats to free speech on campus, or the lack of racial diversity in Panhellenic sororities. I haven't highlighted the things that I truly appreciate and, more specifically, the places in which I\u2019ve found community at Penn.\nLast February, I argued that Black history is important for everyone. Education surrounding Black people, their lives, and their contributions should be integrated into the standard curriculum. Black Penn shows up and shows out every month, but this month in particular, there are many events and ways that Penn student organizations uplift the community and come together.\u00a0\n\t\tIt would be impossible to touch on all of these amazing events and their impacts, but I\u2019d like to paint a picture of some of these groups and their initiatives during this month and beyond. Planning for these events takes months. For example, when Descendants of Afro-Americans at Penn (DAAP) \u2014 a club founded just last year \u2014 put on their first-ever gala on Feb. 1 to kick off the month, you better believe that the event was well-planned and executed.\u00a0\nThe gala \u2014 Red Carpet For A Cause \u2014 supported the Sickle Cell Disease Association of America's Philadelphia and Delaware Valley Chapter. The night included catered food, live performances from student groups like The Inspiration, wonderful community, and beautiful decor\u2014even including an ice sculpture of the DAAP logo. Over $1,700 was raised in support of the foundation.\n\t\t\t\tSEE MORE FROM MIA VESELY:\ufeffI dropped sorority rush and I\u2019m gladFirst Liz Magill, next free speechWhen asked about the impacts of the event, College sophomore and DAAP founding member Clarke Dickens said, \u201cWe wanted to bring the community together for a great cause, especially a cause that affects a lot of African Americans and Black people more broadly.\u201d\nSickle cell disease occurs in about one in every 365 Black babies born in the United States. The percentage of Black people who carry the trait is even higher, with one in 13 Black babies being born as carriers.\n\tDickens is not just involved with DAAP, but is also on the boards for QBlack and Shea Collective.\nThese clubs are all part of something commonly dubbed \u201cBlack Penn,\u201d which focuses on so many different aspects of identity. From cultural organizations like Penn African Student Association (PASA), to preprofessional organizations like Black Wharton and the Black Pre-Law Association (BPLA), to community service organizations like the NAACP, all of these organizations put an emphasis on service both inside the Penn community and out.\u00a0\nFor example, Campus Curlz \u2014 a club I serve on the board of \u2014 is, at first glance, a club centered around uplifting natural hair and embracing positivity. \u00a0But underlying hair mask making events and movie nights, there is a strong commitment to service. Just this month, the community service committee held an event where we made Valentine\u2019s Day cards for senior citizens at Mercy Life West Philadelphia.\nService by board members is a requirement to be part of funding organizations like UMOJA \u2014 the umbrella funding organization for Black clubs \u2014 and even beyond that, many clubs center service in every activity they partake in. Whether you\u2019re on the board of a club or not, there are many service opportunities available and encouraged.\nWhen asked what they wish people knew about Black Penn, Dickens said, \u201cClubs should make an effort to include grad students, it makes all the difference. I\u2019m able to say, \u2018This is what I would look like coming here for grad school,\u2019 and it can even offer opportunities for mentorship.\u201d\nWhat seems to drive Black Penn is first and foremost the students, then the supportive and involved faculty, as well as the local partnerships and opportunities the clubs find, build, and pursue for themselves. Many members of the DAAP board are native to Philadelphia, so that makes their work even more personal.\nWhile Black students do take initiative to realize what they need and create the spaces they want to see, there is so much room for improvement on behalf of Penn: whether it\u2019s stratifying the way funding is given to these clubs \u2014 they often can\u2019t fund silverware in UMOJA meetings if it can be provided elsewhere \u2014 or improving the cultural spaces available to students (we were promised the ARCH \u2018building,\u2019 not the ARCH \u2018basement\u2019). In months like February, Penn aims to spotlight their Black students. I just wish this recognition of the incredible community Black students forged for themselves, when they initially didn\u2019t see it on campus, came year-round.\n\t\tGet our newsletter, DP Daybreak, delivered to your inbox every weekday morning.Events like DAAP's gala happen every month, and it\u2019s important not to understate the role these organizations play in making Penn a welcoming and accepting place for students from marginalized backgrounds.\nI was happy to see Faces of Black Penn \u2014 a Black-run publication \u2014 highlighted in the DP last week. I hope people continue to uplift the work of these student groups going forward and make space to give all students their roses.

          "title": "Bernadine Kumi | I joined a sorority and I\u2019m glad",
          "article_content": "I\u2019ll be honest: I was not a fan of Greek life when I first got to Penn. My perception of Greek life was influenced by growing up in the South, mainly in suburban Georgia. This included a sorority scene of girls with fake spray tans and little to no personality. The images of sorority girls from the University of Georgia and Alabama screamed no diversity, which made me wary of joining a sorority at Penn. Being a First-Generation, Low-Income (FGLI) student made me especially hesitant. Even more so, coming from a Ghanaian household, the notion of a sorority was immediately dismissed as something against our Christian values. Thus, during my first year, I knew I would never, and I mean never, join a sorority.\u00a0\nHowever, by the beginning of sophomore year, my mindset began to change. After a year on campus, I had found a solid community of a small group of friends. But beyond that, I felt that I did not really know anyone. I couldn\u2019t name more than 20 people in my grade. Penn is known for being a networking school, and the \u201cSocial Ivy,\u201d so I began to question just how much I had taken advantage of that. That, along with most of the underclassmen party scene revolving around fraternities, made the idea of rushing even more appealing.\u00a0\n\t\tSo while most people were beginning their sophomore year with the friends they already had, I began to look for additional friends. My twin sister, who also goes to Penn, and I began attending open rush events, talking to sophomores in sororities, and involving ourselves in more social events. Over the next few months, my days consisted of talking to many girls, going to dinners, and putting myself out there in a way that I had been hesitant to do before. I made new friends, met fellow sophomores also in search of a bigger community, and found myself loving the idea of joining a sorority.\u00a0\nBut what made me even more eager was just how inclusive and diverse sororities were at Penn, more so than I had been expecting\u2014especially the off-campus sorority I ended up joining, OAX. I was still wary about rushing, but as soon as I got to the first event, I immediately felt comfortable. There were girls with different interests, passions, economic backgrounds, and personalities. Not a single conversation felt forced. Every girl I met had a unique and authentic story, and I felt like I could talk to them for hours.\n\t\t\t\tSEE MORE FROM BERNADINE KUMI:\ufeffDining hall workers at Penn Hillel demand better treatment from UniversityI was especially captivated by BLOAX (Black OAX), a community within OAX that includes fellow girls of Ghanaian descent and other Black girls who provided me with guidance on navigating Penn as a Black woman. OAX also has other smaller communities, such as LatinOAX and RainbOAX. Being able to find other people with similar backgrounds made the choice to join a sorority that much easier.\u00a0\nAs a FGLI student and Questbridge scholar, the idea of paying high dues out of my minimal work paychecks every month was unfathomable. I knew that joining a sorority would pose another financial burden, and even though I was loving the OAX community, the idea of paying dues scared me. Yet once again, OAX and other sororities surprised me with their understanding and financial transparency.

I was also able to prepare for my interview with girls in my sorority, who gave me the confidence I needed to land the opportunity. As a Black woman and FGLI student, I have truly benefited from joining Greek life. I hope students who are hesitant to rush, just as I once was, will see my experience and how transformative it can be. I hope others \u2014 whether they are Black women, FGLI students, or just Penn students in search of a greater community \u2014 can do the same.\nBERNADINE KUMI is a College junior studying political science and legal studies and history from Roswell, Ga.

          "article_content": "Columnist Jessey Shin explores the problem of disparate advising quality in the College and argues \nfor a more standardized experience.\u201cMy advisor lied to me?\u201d\nI remember someone saying this to me in complete disbelief, but I can\u2019t say I\u2019m surprised. Advisors can be as misleading as they are helpful, and this is a widespread problem that needs addressing.\n\t\tIn the College, students typically have between 15 and 20 credits outside of their primary major to meet the graduation requirement. These are used to fulfill general education requirements, pursue a second major or minor, or take elective courses that align with a student\u2019s interests.\nThe freedom to pursue one\u2019s intellectual pursuits is, of course, one of the draws of the College. I am looking to pursue two majors myself, in somewhat interconnected but disparate fields of study: the flexibility offered by the curriculum allows me to explore these interests without taking an obscene number of classes.\n\t\t\t\tSEE MORE FROM JESSEY SHIN:Making a case for the less popular college housesNavigating the maze of Penn's resources\ufeffThe problem is few students go into their first year knowing which major they would like to pursue, much less exactly which courses to take.\u00a0\nThe College puts a lot of effort into informing incoming students about the curriculum and what they have to offer, such as through the Compass module on Canvas that gives a foray into some aspects of the College experience (something that other schools do not offer). However, the sheer number of options can be overwhelming, giving rise to a unique need for personalized, one-on-one guidance. This is where pre-major advisors come in.\u00a0\n\tPre-major advisors, assigned to each student before they start their first semester at Penn, are a vital resource for College students. They guide students through the course selection process, encouraging and helping them as they explore their various interests and eventually settle on a major.\nI can say that I have had a relatively good experience with my pre-major advisor. However, I also found that some of the advice offered was not fully applicable to my circumstance, because of the recent transition from Penn InTouch to Path@Penn.\nOther students, however, are not as lucky. I have heard stories about advisors making their students cry, spreading misinformation, jeopardizing their advisees\u2019 course registration, you name it.\nIn an interview, one student (who requested anonymity) shared that they have had trouble reaching their pre-major advisor from the get-go. College students must meet with their advisor one-on-one to get their course registration hold lifted; without this, they are not eligible to participate in advance registration. The student was only able to reach their advisor a day or so before the deadline and has continued to have trouble with availability.\nOf course, their pre-major advisor experience was less than ideal. \u201cHer guidance wasn\u2019t so much guidance as it was looking at the boxes and seeing if I checked them,\u201d they said. \u201cI don\u2019t think I would feel comfortable going to her for personal issues, such as which major to pursue or how to explore [some of my interests], because I don\u2019t think she would point me [in] the right direction.\u201d Instead, they had been utilizing their PennCAP advisor (available for FGLI students) for these concerns.\nOn the other hand, some students are able to form a positive relationship with their advisor and find that they are helpful in navigating their interests. Rishi Dadlani, a College first year, described his advisor as \u201cfriendly and helpful. He gave me his phone number and told me to contact him if I [had] any questions \u2026 If I saw him around campus, I would say hi, and he always sends us a beginning-of-semester email.\u201d\n\t\tGet our newsletter, DP Daybreak, delivered to your inbox every weekday morning.This disparity in advising quality means that some students are at a great disadvantage compared to others. While some advisors are able to \u201cpoint students in the right direction,\u201d helping them take the right step forward in their college experience, others fall short. Their advisees must navigate the complicated process of learning about the majors, gen-ed requirements, and figuring out (the surprisingly difficult) advance registration process on their own.\nWhen done right, the freedom of the College curriculum can allow students to truly delve into their academic interests and eventually settle on the right path for them. However, that process requires a lot of research and planning that is supposed to be aided by a pre-major advisor. For incoming first years who are unfamiliar with the landscape at Penn and underclassmen students, this disparity in advising quality poses a challenge. Penn must ensure that all students are able to best utilize the resources at their disposal, and the first place to start is with the guidance they receive.\nJESSEY SHIN is a College first-year studying sociology and communications from Seongnam-si, South Korea.

This month offers an opportunity to delve into the depths of history: exploring narratives that challenge, inspire, and provoke thought. In the spirit of true academic inquiry and in honor of this significant month, I wish to highlight a selection of works by Black authors whose perspectives might diverge from the more commonly embraced interpretations of Black history and culture.\n\t\tIn recommending these texts, my intention is not to endorse every opinion expressed by the authors, but to underscore the importance of engaging with a diversity of viewpoints. These authors challenge us to look beyond the prevailing orthodoxy and to question the narratives that have become commonplace within academic circles. They remind us that the Black American experience, like any aspect of human history, is richly diverse and complex.\nAs members of an academic community that prides itself on intellectual rigor and openness, it is our responsibility to explore a broad spectrum of perspectives, especially those that provoke debate and reflection.

          "article_content": "\u201cWelcome to Penn! You are the most diverse class we ever admitted!\u201d The convocation rhetoric makes you feel so special. Penn is diverse because a student comes from Wisconsin and another from Kazakhstan. One plays the flute, one plays squash. Never mind that all of them want to be bankers or consultants. I wish someone had told me that nearly every other person sitting at Convocation with me would end up in the funnel. That however diverse my first-year class was, my senior class would simply not be.\nAs a teaching assistant for Wharton\u2019s required \u201cBusiness and You\u201d leadership course, I mentor first years adjusting to college and exploring careers. Someone confessed, \u201cIf not banking, then what else could I possibly do?\u201d If the best business school in the world (U.S. News debates aside) makes you believe you only have one option from day one, the institution, culture, and entire system have fundamentally failed.\n\t\tOf course, there is nothing wrong with those jobs: The last thing we need is a trembling economic system and inefficient markets. The problem is blindly assuming that one in two employed Penn grads and 80% of Wharton grads woke up and consciously made such a decision. Unpacking our culture proves how little of a decision this is and how everything revolves around two words: prestige and control.\nIt is common knowledge by now that Penn students are privileged. However, you may not know that for every single student from the bottom 20%, over 21 people come from the top 20%, blithely offsetting their upbringing. The result? An abject elite detached from reality. Okay, perhaps this is cynical, but if we are known for our elitist \u201cseeing and being seen\u201d culture, is it a surprise that 25% of us are so disillusioned to think the average U.S. salary is above six figures? Of course not (both not surprising and not true).\n\t\t\t\tPenn\u2019s alarming lack of socioeconomic diversity (despite efforts acknowledged this) unequivocally creates a culture perpetuating the value of money at the expense of everything else. The people you sit next to in class distract you with their laptop screens: purchasing a Gucci bag or booking Airbnbs in Cancun. The emails you receive are about banking and consulting events. This is the model. The only one. The only one, right?\nLet\u2019s be honest, \u201cjust follow your passion\u201d won\u2019t pay the bills, and I cannot blame an indebted or underprivileged student for desiring financial freedom with a high-paying job. This is why I am not saying the Wall Street lifestyle is unethical, although like others, I could. I am saying this is only one way to live your life. One of infinitely many. Which one makes sense for YOU?\n\tEveryone at Penn is good at planning, several are good at doing, and almost none are good at reflecting. The purpose of your college education is not exclusively career preparation. If this is what they had you do, I hate to tell you that you have been robbed. As writer William Deresiewicz argues, \u201cWhat you should want to develop in college is the habit of reflection, which means the capacity for change because most of what you come across in college will inevitably fade from memory. What is left over, precisely, is you.\u201d A culture, even more so an institution, should give you the tools to understand what model of life you want to live, not impose the model on you.\nYet, my student's question is central and inevitable: What else if not banking?\nAsking yourself what truly energizes you is no easy task, because it requires the vulnerability to let go of the comforting lifetime certainty that the predetermined path gives you: 2025 summer recruiting, analyst, associate \u2026 Well, the desire to eliminate uncertainty eliminates life. What do you plan to do after \u201csome years of experience\u201d with your future free time and why on earth are you not doing it now?\nIn his book \u201cExcellent Sheep,\u201d Deresiewicz advocates for the importance of time off, slowing down, breaking the cycle of endless achievement, and acknowledging the existence of a world outside of your Ivy League. It may be scandalous to some and unmistakable to others, but what if you replaced your obsessive passion for finance with one that is harmonious, perhaps exploring capacities you have not had a chance to cultivate? What if you did something you purposefully cannot put on a resume or post on LinkedIn? Yes, you may be \u201cbehind\u201d those who doubtlessly persist in the hierarchy, but what is the purpose of being at the top if you are climbing the wrong mountain?\n\t\tGet our newsletter, DP Daybreak, delivered to your inbox every weekday morning.The main idea behind the Pathless Path is not to neglect the ambition that got us where we are (not even to stop using Path@Penn), but rather to remember that Penn is not a four-year treadmill to (and playground for) the American elite. Yes, it was founded for them, but Penn\u2019s core mission today is the pursuit, enhancement, and dissemination of knowledge.

          "article_content": "Columnist Mariana Martinez describes her personal experiences with Penn's dining services.A text from my friend lit up my phone.\u00a0\n\u201cDude, you\u2019re literally getting the reverse Freshman 15!\u201d\n\t\t\u201cThe what?\u201d I replied.\nAs an international student, I had no idea that Freshman 15 was a thing. But by the time I found out what it was, it was already too late. My eating schedule became very irregular: I skipped meals thinking it was more practical for me. Because of Penn\u2019s poor dining services and few inclusive food options, my physical and mental health were severely affected by the end of my first semester.\u00a0\n\t\t\t\t\ufeffBefore coming to Penn, when people asked me what I would miss most from Colombia, I usually answered by saying I'd miss the food. But as my first semester flew by, I realized it went beyond missing my country\u2019s food and more into an overwhelming transition and violent adjustment to the American diet, characterized by fast-food consumption, takeout over-reliance, and a lack of fresh food. It made my transition to college even more overwhelming than it already was.\u00a0\nI never expected diet to pose the challenge it did during my first semester. I didn\u2019t expect my food options to narrow so suddenly. The differences between the American and other countries\u2019 diets cause international students to mess up their meal structure. In the midst of the American diet, breakfast becomes the least important meal, meal times become arbitrary, and late dinners are frequent.\u00a0\n\tI found myself skipping breakfast because I couldn\u2019t tolerate American breakfast foods: bacon, potatoes, sausage, casseroles. I stopped eating fruit, and I started eating only one large meal a day. At the same time, I was pushing myself to be my best in my classes, clubs, and job while running on very little fuel. By winter break, my body was pretty much destroyed.\nAs I asked other international students about their dining habits, I found that my experience was not an isolated one. Some of them told me that they \u201cjust don\u2019t know what to eat anymore.\u201d Others said that because of their international status, they had a limited budget to eat off-campus and that relying on Penn\u2019s terrible food was torturous.\u00a0\nSurveys have shown that as international students transition into their lives at American universities, many face dietary challenges and health consequences. For instance, many international students report a halt in their fruit and vegetable consumption because they believe the United States\u2019 options are not as fresh. Others report severe weight loss/gain and stomach issues from struggling to adapt to an American diet that consists mainly of meals large in sugars and fat.\u00a0\nBack in Colombia, I was used to having almost five meals a day. My diet included cereals and a variety of meats, vegetables, and fruits. Other international students also report being accustomed to multi-course meals, often characterized by a careful, homemade preparation. On the other hand, the American diet narrows down choices abruptly. International students describe their choices as pizza, salad, pasta, French fries, sandwiches, and chicken \u2014 which holds true to the quintessential Penn dining experience.\u00a0\n\t\tGet our newsletter, DP Daybreak, delivered to your inbox every weekday morning.Being thrown into a poor dietary environment has a significant impact on students\u2019 mental health. Many studies show that students with poor dietary conditions are more likely to suffer from depression and anxiety. The dietary conditions at Penn have impacted my emotional well-being: It is very frustrating to feel like I have no high-quality dining options. The strain on my wallet as I buy groceries and off-campus food is also stressful, considering around a third of Penn\u2019s international students are on financial aid.\u00a0\nThe international student experience with the food at Penn can only be described as aggravating. Not only is the American diet more unhealthy than food in international students\u2019 countries, but it also causes disruptions in meal structure and health. As a school that prides itself on being diverse, Penn should really focus on making the dining experience more accessible for its international students. Not to mention an improvement in the food would benefit the whole student body, given recent events. It is clear that this becomes a matter beyond just food: it\u2019s also about inclusivity, general well-being, and enjoying the college experience.\u00a0\nMARIANA MARTINEZ is a College first year studying English and classics from Bogot\u00e1, Colombia.

          "title": "Chapin Lenthall-Cleary | The Penn administration farcically mistreats new student clubs",
          "article_content": "Guest Columnist Chapin Lenthall-Cleary highlights the bureaucratic hurdles that face student organizations and clubs at Penn.It's no secret that many of the University's student clubs are brutally exclusive \u2014 often demanding prospective members submit applications and participate in interviews \u2014 only to bar most of them from participating anyway. It's no secret that this system of club exclusivity inflicts a variety of harms on students: It deprives them of opportunities to participate in academic, service, recreational, and other activities. It shuts them out of a significant avenue of making friends. It pits students against each other. It furthers a culture obsessed with credentials over learning (or whatever a club's mission might be). And, as if all of that weren't damaging enough, it wastes non-trivial amounts of students' limited time at the University.\u00a0\nIt's far less well known, however, that the University's administration \u2014 especially the Office of Student Affairs \u2014 imposes numerous stringent, farcical, and sometimes nearly insurmountable hurdles upon new, often open-membership clubs.\u00a0\n\t\tIn October 2022, I founded Penn Humans vs. Zombies (HvZ), a (then-unofficial) club that held live-action zombie apocalypse games with Nerf blasters in David Rittenhouse Laboratory. The games were open to everyone and attracted a range of undergraduates across various schools, plus graduate students, alumni, a few students from nearby schools, and occasionally a professor. We required no applications or interviews, even for club leadership positions, which were filled by those willing to do the extra work to help run the games. Against even the advice of some club officers, I refused to charge admission.\u00a0\nI don't want to oversell this: Lance or not, I wasn't killing any windmills. One silly game with an earnest mission, of course, wasn't fixing a broken system, nor was HvZ the only open-membership club at Penn. But HvZ was at least one example of something the University desperately needs and badly, though not completely, lacks places for Penn students to find community and friends with shared interests, free from demands to run a marathon in a rat race just for a chance at being let in the gate. In fact, my uncompromisingly open-membership policies are exactly what even OSA claims to want.\n\t\t\t\tSEE MORE FROM \ufeffOPINION:\ufeffEmily Chang | No Senator, not all Asians are ChineseKiyah Akins | How I have been shaped by Black historyAbout a year passed before I realized that our zombies weren\u2019t the most soulless people HvZ would have to face. Last fall, after hearing about HvZ, the building manager contacted me, demanded that I stop the games, and revoked my 24/7 access to DRL. I reluctantly agreed to stop holding the games in DRL, but I reached out to the director of OSA to appeal the decision, where I was met with a tsunami of bureaucracy and an instruction to stop the games until they gave approval. The process involved meetings between multiple members of OSA, public safety, risk management, and others. When I asked to be involved in these discussions, I received the canned reply, \"[OSA has] not traditionally included students at this stage of conversation.\"\u00a0\nIt took over a month to get permission from OSA to continue the games and about as long to sort out the actual process of getting a space. There was just one problem: OSA's Kafka-and-friends committee decided that HvZ had to occur in an athletic space. When I tried to rent such a space, I discovered that doing so would cost $75 an hour, or around $4,500 per semester for a four-hour game once a week, an impossible cost for our club. When I told the OSA director that having to pay this fee to continue our game would be as good as a death sentence for HvZ and asked for the fee to be waived or paid, I was told to go find funding. I'll say that again: We spent months waiting, only to be told that we needed to find a way to get the University to pay us thousands of dollars \u2014 that we'd use to pay Penn the fee they decided to charge us \u2014 to play a game that costs them nothing.\n\tI did everything the OSA director suggested and more to try to get funding. As it currently stands, we have only a small fraction of what we actually need. And, I'm not hopeful, because this isn't the first time I've tried to get funding for a club.\u00a0\nLast winter, I founded Drone Club, another open-membership club. This one was dedicated to building drones, and I was willing to teach less experienced students the electronics, soldering, physics, and skills involved in doing so. Initially, I paid largely out-of-pocket for parts, but this wasn't ideal or particularly sustainable, so I sought club funding. With significant effort and about a month's delay, we got $220, about half of what we requested, from the Common Funding Application, the very funding source the OSA director suggested we use to find thousands of dollars for HvZ. In fall 2023, in order to secure larger, more regular funding, I applied for SAC recognition, the primary avenue for regular club funding, for Drone Club.\u00a0\nDrone Club was rejected for the sole reason of not having been on the PennClubs website since Oct. 31, 2022 (yes, that\u2019s over a year before we applied, and it\u2019s different from the deadline listed on the SAC website). The stated reason for the requirement that inspired that rejection is that \"student groups must be sustainable,\" which requiring students to check a box a year in advance obviously does little to confirm. Indeed, as I noted in Drone Club's application, where I asked SAC \"not to reject us upon a technicality, and instead judge us upon our merits,\" Drone Club's mostly underclassman membership is an infinitely better metric for sustainability.\u00a0\nEven clubs that are accepted still aren't written into the SAC budget until the school year after applying. Combined together, these requirements mean that, even if nothing goes wrong, a new club takes years to receive SAC budget funding. Under the current system, a sophomore who started a club now would graduate before having a chance at seeing any SAC budget funding.\u00a0\nThe above is only a small fraction of the examples of Penn institutions' hostility towards new clubs: being denied tables at the activity fair, having Drone Club removed from the PennClubs website for not getting Engineering Student Activities Council recognition (which, according to the PennClubs website, isn't a requirement), and more. If you're shocked by the severity and regularity of this problem, keep in mind that these are only examples of the University's administration\u2019s hostility towards new, open-membership clubs that I run (and therefore know about), which are doubtlessly a tiny subset of the full problem.\u00a0\n\t\tGet our newsletter, DP Daybreak, delivered to your inbox every weekday morning.Despite this relentless onslaught, I still don't know how this story ends. There's still a scenario where a powerful administrator decides to put the welfare of students above rules and diktats, and says, \"Enough of this nonsense,\" and HvZ gets to return triumphantly to DRL, or at least to another good location, free from extortionate fees. There's still a scenario where Drone Club secures its funding for parts, and the many other clubs doubtlessly facing similar farcical obstacles are instead met with a well-lit road, not numerous Harnwell-and-a-half-high hurdles. Heck, there's still a scenario where OSA lives up to its stated ideals and starts staunchly supporting open-membership clubs and exerting real force to get closed-membership clubs to open up.\u00a0\nThis hasn't been a happy story, and I'm frankly not betting on that changing. Nor, sadly, would a single exception for HvZ solve this massive harm to students, thrilled though I\u2019d be to get such an exception. But this story isn\u2019t over yet. If enough people, or even one person with enough power, decide to end this farce today and decide that doing right by students must always come first, there could yet be not only a happy ending to HvZ's struggle but also a bright future for all open-membership clubs at the University. To the administrators who\u2019ve caused this damage and to those who have the power to fix it, shape up.\nCHAPIN LENTHALL-CLEARY is a College senior studying physics and philosophy from Radnor, Pa.

          "article_content": "I support the use of ChatGPT.\nA statement that, said aloud, would garner me sidelong stares despite the website\u2019s appearance in many lecture halls.\n\t\tThe use of ChatGPT has raised much debate among students and become a topic of considerable contention. Similarly, many professors hold polarizing views, as the use of generative AI has been harshly rejected in some classrooms while others have tentative policies supporting its usage. The limitation of emerging technology in educational spaces should raise alarm bells, as we are rejecting tools that could be invaluable for facilitating learning. \u00a0\nTo be clear, I am against academic dishonesty, and I haven\u2019t used ChatGPT in a duplicitous manner. However, saying that ChatGPT is synonymous with academic misconduct is a remarkably weighty statement. I do assent that some individuals could use ChatGPT in an academically dishonest way, such as employing it to write papers in their stead. But, a similar result could be accomplished via other online tools, like Google. Just recently, we have become privy to accusations of plagiarism by former Harvard President Claudine Gay, revealing how this is not solely a ChatGPT issue. Thus, our viewpoint of the perpetrator should be reframed, delegating the fault to the person, not the tool.\n\t\t\n\t\nWith the release of GPT-4, many professors and students alike need to reconsider its benefits. Professors already recommend YouTube for content help, so why not ChatGPT?\nChatGPT can be a remarkable asset that provides an advantage to disadvantaged students. Since many Penn students come into university with a deep background in their chosen field of study, which they gained from their access to prep schools or private tutors, the bridge between these two groups is substantial. ChatGPT provides a way to somewhat balance the playing field.\n\tFor one, GPT-4\u2019s added feature of uploading PDFs makes it ridiculously simple to ask questions about lecture content, at any time of the day, while tailoring it to your level of understanding, a skill that many professors and teaching assistants lack. As several professors are utterly immersed in their fields and many TAs have an intuitive grasp of the subject, they are often incapable of making complex topics digestible. Unfortunately, there have been many instances where I gave up on asking questions to avoid receiving a convoluted response.\u00a0\nWith ChatGPT, feedback is immediate, allowing students to reflect on areas of improvement in their work, and providing them with mechanisms to improve over time. Why go through the hassle of setting up TA office hours to ask a simple question when ChatGPT can do it instantaneously?\u00a0\nStudents outside of Penn who do not have access to an educational institution with tutoring facilities also stand to attain so much from receiving academic help from ChatGPT. This is due to its similarity to using online services like Khan Academy, though ChatGPT is much more personalized.\nProfessors who reject the idea of incorporating ChatGPT into classrooms have not considered thinking critically of its beneficial uses. Instead, they are content with adhering to traditional practices, foregoing innovation for comfort. On the other hand, students who are against the usage of AI hold themselves to a higher standard for not relying on outside sources \u2014 similar to many Penn students' views of receiving academic help through services like Weingarten tutoring or office hours.

          "title": "Francesco Salamone | Let\u2019s talk about dying!",
          "article_content": "\u201cWhat do your parents do?\u201d someone seriously asked me during Wharton orientation. Fighting my brain's battle between an unforced desire to share and an aversion to the anticipated awkward look, I recognized that I would face a long, interminable moment of apnea trying to explain to the world that I do not have two parents because my dad died. Grief exists, and at Penn, it isolates.\nTo be clear, I do not intend to be a prophet speaking universal truths because loss looks different for everyone, but I hope you will find truth in my words nonetheless. Death is a sensitive topic, not the least because it intertwines with cultural, religious, spiritual, and socioeconomic aspects of our identity. Yet grief is undeniably omnipresent, and Penn is no exception, meaning I am not the first one to write (or talk) about it, nor will I be the last, unfortunately.\n\t\tAlmost 40% of college students have lost a family member or close friend within the last two years. Considering there are 18.58 million college students, that makes us more than 7 million grievers. I guess we are not a minority, are we?\u00a0\nWharton senior Pranavi Karnati lost her father last December after a battle with glioblastoma. She bravely watched him suffer for more than a year and a half, but \u201cdespite the pain he felt, he always managed to make us smile.\u201d She experienced a slower, anticipatory death and described her grief as \u201cisolating.\u201d\n\t\t\t\tSEE MORE FROM FRANCESCO SALAMONE: \ufeffIs Penn about liberal arts or elite jobs?There is no definitively designated place to grieve at Penn. Yes, Student Health and Counseling helps (if you are lucky), but 61% of college counselors in the United States report feeling \u201csomewhat, little, or not comfortable at all\u201d with supporting students primarily on grief. Unlike peer institutions like Princeton that offer grief-focused support groups, Penn lacks such infrastructure. The only comparable program that existed was Actively Move Forward, but it has been inactive since 2019.\nWhat about Philadelphia-based groups? As Karnati shared, before you even get a chance to talk about grief, you may face an identity crisis. \u201cThere are groups for children and groups for adults. What am I? Where are college students supposed to sign up?\u201d\n\tThe result explains why grief feels isolating. Naturally, some prefer to process on their own, but sooner or later, we crave feeling less like an alien and more like we are not the only ones experiencing excruciating pain. And support groups are one easy way to find others who relate.\nOf course, this is only half the problem. Remember, I believe Penn is a detached elite. Having two parents is a privilege: emotionally but interestingly also economically, and substantially so. I cannot blame you for having a privilege you did not choose, but I can and will invite you to reflect on it.\u00a0\nAfter Karnati posted her terrible news, she received several supportive messages: \u201cLmk if you need anything\u201d stood out. She mentioned, \u201cMy loss is making me realize who my true friends really are.\u201d\u00a0\nCan Penn students only support one another through hasty texts with cheap acronyms?\nWe know your \u201cI\u2019m here if you need me\u201d is well-intentioned, but understand that it creates a dilemma by putting the onus of starting the conversation on us, inadvertently burdening the griever even more. The individualistically expeditious culture of Penn is inevitably in direct contrast to the prolonged nonlinear path that grievers experience. At best, Penn students are awkwardly unequipped to support a grieving friend and at worst, fundamentally incapable of slowing down to care and empathize. You can do better.\nLike what? Be present with your friend\u2019s pain, listen with the heart, respect disordered confusion, and discover the gifts of sacred silence over filling words. That is what grief counselor Dr. Alan Wolfelt calls companioning. I wish my friends knew about companionship to ask me about my dad. Ask me what he was like, what he liked to do, what his quirks were. God, just ask me what his name was. When you ask, you are not reminding me that he died (trust me, I know), you are letting me know that you acknowledge that he lived.\nThe truth is I cannot blame them. Part of the matter is institutional and part of it is cultural: Many of us are used to the high school familiarity of knowing at least some family members of our friends. For better or for worse, in college, you are nothing more to others than what you present. And unlike your Canada Goose, you cannot wear your invisible grief when you walk down Locust. What you can wear is a Penn Face and pretend no one died, even with your closest friends, because it is profoundly easier and more tempting than the unfathomable truth.\nSo please, I beg you, next time you come across a griever, think twice before ending the conversation out of discomfort or sending the \u201cI\u2019m here if you need me\u201d text. Think beyond and think deeper. Perhaps take the simplest approach: Sit down with them and see where they will bring you.\n\t\tGet our newsletter, DP Daybreak, delivered to your inbox every weekday morning.If we collectively accept death as a mainstream topic of social dialogue, grief will be easier to handle than to hide. Harvard professor and happiness expert Arthur Brooks says: \u201cGrief does not have to be a private misery and net harm to our lives. We can learn to comprehend it, manage it, and grow from it. And in understanding our own grief, we can help others heal and thrive as well.\u201d\nAfter seven years, I understand my grief, and it is my hope (and Karnati\u2019s recent hope) that these words will help somebody.\nFRANCESCO SALAMONE is a Wharton sophomore from Palermo, Italy.

          "article_content": "This semester, I somehow ended up with four out of my five classes being either directly or indirectly about ethics. As a political science major, I was really excited to take these classes, since whenever people talk about ethics nowadays, it mostly has to do with politics or international relations.\nAt a time when our reality changes so rapidly because of technology, and when we are faced with a number of global challenges, some people have forgotten about the importance of acting morally. Especially at a place like Penn, where everyone seems to be extremely worried about their future and their careers, people often disregard these values when they are caught up by the competitive environment. Because of this, one would think that ethics classes would be extremely beneficial for all, but do they actually contribute to making students more ethical individuals?\n\t\tAccording to my professors, they don\u2019t.\nIn all four ethics classes, my professors started the semester by telling us that ethics classes will not make most of us more ethical. I sat there, listening to all of them, and I just could not understand why they would say something like that. If I wasn\u2019t going to learn anything, what was the point of taking these classes?\n\t\t\t\tSEE MORE FROM ZARA TENA:The urgent need for younger voices in politics\ufeffIt\u2019s okay to be ordinaryThat\u2019s where I was wrong: I have been learning a lot. While perhaps the main goal of ethics classes is not to turn students into more ethical people, they definitely give us the tools we need to critically engage with ethical dilemmas. By taking these classes, I might not become a better person, but they have given me a space where I can explore, discuss, and reflect about where I stand on so many issues and what my beliefs about morality actually are.\nEthics is not a subject that can be forcefully taught through lectures and readings. There is no way that we can sit down for three hours every week and magically become more ethical just because we memorize theories and read long papers written by old white men. The goal of these classes is not to tell us what is \u2018right\u2019 or \u2018wrong,\u2019 \u00a0but to give us the skills to navigate the gray areas in ethical decision making.\n\tThese classes encourage self reflection and personal growth. Even when analyzing big case studies or exploring different theories, students are pushed to question their own values, beliefs, and biases. While this may not guarantee that we will completely transform our moral compasses, the self awareness that comes from these reflections creates a great foundation for understanding why we act the way we do and also invites us to try to understand others.\nThe fact that ethics classes begin with a warning \u2014 that you won\u2019t become more ethical by taking them \u2014 should not stop anyone from giving them a chance. The ability to think critically, understand different values and perspectives, and have the skills to self reflect are essential parts of any college education. They prepare students for the complicated moral dilemmas they might face in their personal and professional lives \u2014 especially when most people at Penn will end up with jobs that are notorious for their ethical scandals!\nZARA TENA is a College sophomore studying political science from Puebla, Mexico.

          "article_content": "How many times have you found yourself in a never-ending cycle of back-and-forth messages, trying to pin down a date for a long overdue catch up with a friend? Every get together begins to feel as if it requires intricate planning and strips away the simplicity of social connection. This routine becomes stifling, lacking spontaneity and authenticity; you\u2019re constrained to coordinating with the same faces in the same places.\u00a0\nThis is what I like to call scheduling fatigue.\u00a0\n\t\tAs a result of this phenomenon, gatherings among friends are beginning to resemble scheduled business meetings, meticulously arranged via tools like When2Meet or synchronized Google Calendars.\nWhile resorting to scheduling may seem like the only viable option to maintain a semblance of social connection, perhaps it's time to embrace the idea of venturing out solo: I\u2019m challenging you to go on an unplanned side quest all by yourself to a third place.\u00a0\n\t\t\t\tMORE FROM LALA MUSTAFA:A nation on defense: Dismantling misinformation against Azerbaijan in the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict\ufeff\ufeffAllow me to explain. Picture the first place as your home and the second as your place of education or work. Now, the third place emerges as a public sphere where individuals congregate, not out of any obligation like in the previously mentioned locations, but, for lack of a more precise term, to simply vibe. It could be the cozy corner of a cafe, a communal park, or even the neighborhood barbershop \u2014 anywhere that\u2019ll allow you to interact with people outside your usual circles.\u00a0\nYet, at many universities like Penn, the concept of a third place seems all but lost as our lives remain restricted to school grounds, causing even our first and second places to converge into one. While spots on campus \u2014 like Stommons, Pret, or the cultural centers in ARCH \u2014 can offer some respite, they often come with the latent pressure of being on the clock. Conversations here revolve around assignments, internships, and the intricacies of Penn culture. The chances of an unexpected encounter dwindle given that most people in attendance will be other Penn students. As we\u2019re cocooned in the Penn bubble, it comes as no surprise that many students spend their four years in Philadelphia without ever fully exploring it.\u00a0\n\tYet, this insulation comes at a cost that extends far beyond what we realize.\u00a0\nIt severs our connection not only from the outside world but also from ourselves. That is, within such limits, our individuality dwindles, reducing us to mere roles influenced by our peers. By excluding ourselves from a wider social sphere, we inhibit opportunities to engage with diverse perspectives, trap ourselves in a cycle of familiarity, and risk leading monotonous lives that pave the way to burnout.\nHowever, in our lives, both intimacy and affiliation with broader communities are essential. While intimacy often stems from our immediate circles, affiliation thrives in third places where spontaneous interactions occur. These spaces facilitate easy contact with new individuals on a regular basis, without the need for prior scheduling. As they consistently offer an opportunity for interaction with others, they end up cultivating the most reliable form of socialization.\u00a0\nSo, if you are keen on exploring new horizons and getting involved in the Philadelphia community, I suggest checking out the many informative articles dedicated to bursting the Penn bubble.\nNevertheless, I want to avoid confining third places to physical locations. They\u2019re more of a mindset, a willingness to embrace spontaneity wherever it may arise. They don't have to be far from campus or require spending money. Instead, third places can be any informal spots you visit \u2014 whether it's your student lounge, the library, or a community center.\u00a0\n\t\tGet our newsletter, DP Daybreak, delivered to your inbox every weekday morning.We often find ourselves caught up in the routines of daily life, clinging to familiar patterns of scheduling and social interaction.

          "title": "Beatriz B\u00e1ez | No closed captioning available",
          "article_content": "Columnist Beatriz B\u00e1ez explains her experience with language fatigue at Penn.On my first day at Penn, I called my father in distress, telling him I needed to move back home and study there as I was going to die alone at this university. My father asked why, and I quickly responded, \u201cI haven\u2019t met anybody in three hours. I have no friends. It\u2019s over for me.\u201d\u00a0\nThat very same night, I went to a New Student Orientation event at Houston Hall. As I nervously paced the floor in my Crocs, I overheard some students speaking Spanish and immediately gravitated toward them. Confessing, \u201cI heard Spanish, and I feel saved,\u201d I ended up meeting three genuine individuals, all from various parts of Latin America. Having arrived in the United States, it felt comforting to hear voices that reminded me of home. This comfort is priceless in such a foreign environment.\n\t\tAll my life, I\u2019ve taken courses in Spanish, spoken Spanish at home, and been berated by my grandmother whenever I spoke too much English. Arriving at Penn, I didn\u2019t anticipate the struggle I would face taking classes taught in English, as I had been lucky enough to have been extensively taught English from a very young age.\nBut speaking in a second language most of the time, even as a fluent speaker, is incredibly draining. Meeting native Spanish speakers at Penn was truly a blessing. However, I have found that some people react adversely to me speaking my primary language. These are not continuous reactions of a high degree, but there have been enough small instances to mark me.\u00a0\n\t\t\t\tMORE ON THIS TOPIC:Students celebrate 40th annual Festival Latinx, honoring Latinx culture on campusLa Casa Latina celebrates 2023 Latinx Heritage Month at PennOn various occasions, I have had Latinx friends say, \u201cLet\u2019s speak English so X person doesn\u2019t feel excluded,\u201d or even resort to English for \u201cconvenience\u201d when we\u2019re alone. For the former, I understand the sentiment. I wouldn\u2019t want someone to be excluded from a conversation in such a way. However, when I\u2019m naturally speaking Spanish, having my speech interpreted as a personal offense is off-putting.\u00a0\nIn one instance, I met a student through a mutual friend on a night out. This friend and I speak fluent Spanish; the person I had just met did not. Throughout the night, I had various conversations with my new acquaintance \u2014 who I found quite amicable \u2014 and my friend. I would naturally speak Spanish with the latter, not thinking much of it. The next morning, my friend told me how the new acquaintance felt I hated them for speaking Spanish in front of them, knowing they didn\u2019t speak the language.\u00a0\n\tI was shocked by the assumption and, in all honesty, a little offended. I found it quite conceited that one would think another person is speaking in their first language to actively exclude them. Speaking in a first language, for me, is purely a relief issue. Although I am fluent in English, after an entire week of speaking it, it can be extremely draining; thus, particularly in a social setting, I don\u2019t want to add to the exhaustion.\u00a0\nIt is more than fine to be curious about what somebody is saying and ask for a translation. However, immediately expressing discomfort upon hearing another language and presuming the other person is talking badly about you is inconsiderate toward them. More often than not, this language switch is for comfort. This was the first of sufficient instances that exposed a pattern in my time at Penn. In another class, I grew close to a few other Spanish-speaking students. One of them continuously suggested we switch back to English for seemingly no valid reason and would reply to any comment of mine in English.\u00a0\nThis harsh reality on campus expands into the club scene. In one instance, a native English speaker attended a club meeting primarily led in Spanish. Within this meeting, if club members asked questions in Spanish, any other members who answered quickly switched to English. Evidently, the intent is to have everybody be able to partake in conversation. However, members within a Spanish-led group should be able to detach from English formalities within club meetings, particularly if the club seeks to embrace Latinx heritage.\u00a0\nSpeaking in my primary language is the greatest manifestation of my culture, particularly since Spanish accents are so diverse throughout Latin America. Having to switch to English not only in academic settings but in seemingly every other sphere of Penn life further disconnects me from the culture I\u2019ve been surrounded by my entire life until now. This applies to any person whose main language isn\u2019t English, not only to Spanish speakers.\u00a0\n\t\tGet our newsletter, DP Daybreak, delivered to your inbox every weekday morning.Penn has students from over 100 countries, with around 19% of the student body being international. If one truly wants to immerse themselves in Penn\u2019s multilingual community, one needs to recognize that a language barrier works both ways. Just as an English speaker may be tired from learning another language, a non-English speaker can be drained from constantly speaking English. It\u2019s crucial to recognize that for the latter, multilingualism surpasses a simple language requirement and spills over to nearly every sector of their life at Penn.\u00a0\nLanguage fatigue is a true reality, especially for individuals who haven\u2019t learned English from a young age. Thus, if somebody within your social group is speaking their first language, which you are not fluent in, it does not give you the right to feel offended or urge them to speak in a tongue you understand. And, if you are a non-native English speaker, as much as you can, \"habla en tu primer idioma y que los dem\u00e1s se ubiquen.\"\nBEATRIZ B\u00c1EZ is a College first year studying mathematics and political science from San Juan, Puerto Rico.

In our instruction at the University of Pennsylvania, we were told to reach for safety and to secure our decadence. So are the students now, but they are not nearly as certain that this is the road they\u2019d really like to walk. The students I knew have already paid that price for that ticket, and their horizons, on a human level, look bleak.\u00a0\n\t\tPhiladelphia is not a college town.

The crisis is deepening, and history is accelerating.\n\t\t\n\t\nFewer illusions are possible for the young mind in Philadelphia, which tempers and sharpens it like metal on metal.

The scramble for acceptance into mediocre clubs and fraternities is insufferable, and the false authority these groups stand on in order to make these judgments is embarrassing.

          "article_content": "At this point, many Penn students have lived the terrible dining stories at a number of halls across campus. While it\u2019s important to discuss the health and sanitary risks associated with some of these concerns, it\u2019s also necessary to break down how this problem factors into students\u2019 academic and mental well-being.\u00a0\nOpening Sidechat every few days to see yet another picture of undercooked meat or hearing horror stories from my friends dissuades me from trekking across campus to eat at many of our dining halls. Oftentimes, I find myself skipping meals or stretching the time out between each one \u2014 until I accept the fact that I\u2019ll be eating the same food I already ate a couple times that week. Does this mean that I\u2019m probably missing out on some of the necessary vitamins or fiber I should be getting daily? Probably.\n\t\tNumerous Penn Dining Wellness emails live in our inboxes with tips on improving digestive health and practicing better healthy habits in our daily lives. Additionally, the official page for Penn Dining boasts awards and recognitions for sustainability and top college dining. However, the pristine and glossy promotional pictures of sandwiches, smoothies, and breakfast bowls tell a completely different story from the reality on campus.\nWith two of the most historical repeat offenders \u2014 Hill House and 1920 Commons \u2014 being the only consistent options available for on campus dining during the weekend, it\u2019s much more convenient to resort to the other retail spots scattered around campus. However, some of these locations are far apart, depending on where you live, and can add additional costs to weekly expenses. \u00a0\n\t\t\t\tSEE MORE FROM HANADI ABDULKADIR:\ufeffPenn should require an African American history courseWhy social media and Palestinian activism goes hand in handAdditionally, for students who are dishing out a hefty sum of money to enroll in the dining plan, going out of their way to seek expensive alternatives takes away money that could\u2019ve been better spent elsewhere. Considering that first years and sophomores are required to pick a dining plan for their first two years at Penn, it\u2019s no wonder that students have consistently called for the food standards to match the high prices of these meal swipes. Ideally, no student should feel like they need to resort to options outside of Penn; rather, outside options should be supplemental to an already quality level of options at all dining halls.\u00a0\nSince coming to Penn, my relationship with food has become much more complex. I need to look twice when picking out a seemingly clean utensil to eat whatever is on my plate or stare extra hard at my salad with suspicion before consuming it. But growing up, food was always a way for me to connect with my family and friends, to bring us back together even when we hadn\u2019t seen each other in a long time. Yet the food at Penn, at its worst, has left me frustrated and succeeded at suppressing my appetite \u2014 something I actually can relate to other students about.\n\tAlthough certain foods are scientifically linked to improving mental clarity and focus, I hesitate in reaching for those vegetables because they don\u2019t look as fresh or appetizing when lined up on display in Kings Court English House. As a result, I look for short-term solutions in coffee, which leaves me feeling tired earlier in the day or exhausted while trying to tackle my assignments at night. In order to meet my immediate deadlines, I prioritize some assignments over others, meaning some classes suffer in academic performance and perpetuate an almost never-ending cycle of playing catch-up. I believe that the root cause of all these problems can be traced back to the lack of decent dining.\u00a0\nThis same sentiment has been echoed by many of my friends and peers. But the dining quality at Penn can be mitigated if the University addresses the root problem. Whether that be promoting clean and sanitary workspaces when handling food or streamlining student complaints to Penn Dining other than through email, the University can restore student faith in the system. When it comes to campus dining, Penn can improve upon our experiences by implementing the changes that students deserve to enjoy, especially at the height of midterm season.\nHANADI ABDULKADIR is a College sophomore studying international relations from Philadelphia.

And yes, Penn is actually active in areas outside of Wharton\u2019s finance programs.\nSo, when Penn Engineering announced its new undergraduate program in artificial intelligence, many of us were enthusiastic about the University\u2019s growing role in the innovation sector: a space thought to be dominated by less business-oriented institutions.\n\t\t\t\tSEE MORE FROM MRITIKA SENTHIL: Removing legacy admissions will align Penn\u2019s actions more closely with its educational missionWhy changing leadership won\u2019t eliminate antisemitism at PennBut Penn\u2019s realization, of possibly its most practical initiative, begs the question: Is the University actually necessary in DevOps? Does sitting in a classroom \u2014 let alone one that\u2019s in the midst of a campus known for its influx of finance bros \u2014 really supersede what can be MacGyvered by a tech junkie with only a laptop, caffeine, and time? I want to give a definite \u201cno.\u201d Otherwise, I would need to hold my classmates and myself accountable for upholding all the exclusivity that comes with attending Penn. And yet, there are a frustrating number of anonymous netizens, D-list journalists, and LinkedIn bards who call Ivy League universities like Penn \u201cout of touch\u201d \u2014 remnants of centuries-old American elitism in an era of bottom-up grassroots movements.\nOne C-suite executive anticipates that \u201cthe best AI engineers and builders won\u2019t graduate Penn Engineering. They'll be global, builders and in the right group chats.\u201d His readers agree, with one commenter further emphasizing that \u201cuniversities cannot keep up with the pace of free market innovation.\u201d When these schools attempt to go against the grain and align with consumer needs, \u201cit genuinely looks embarrassing and out of date.\u201d\n\tIn an environment where the use of AI models is largely democratized, we\u2019re naturally drawn to the trope of a layperson who forgoes bureaucratic systems to channel their intelligence: creating life-changing inventions that would have never come to be under self-serving corporate and political influences. And when ignoring cases of succor \u2014 as mainstream media unfortunately does \u2014 there are many examples of such successes. Bill Gates and Paul Allen, co-founders of Microsoft, were university dropouts. So were Meta Platforms co-founders Mark Zuckerberg and Dustin Moskovitz. As Penn\u2019s over reliance on donors came to light earlier this school year, critics of the upper crust have continued to group Penn with other perpetrators of social stratification. The field of AI is, by nature, continuously evolving. And limiting growth in the discipline to those who can afford, and then succeed in Penn\u2019s Department of Computer and Information Science courses is counterproductive.\nHowever, these narratives misrepresent the intentions of Penn\u2019s AI program.\nTo make a better case for Penn\u2019s AI major, I spoke with Robert Ghrist, Andrea Mitchell Professor and associate dean for undergraduate education at Penn Engineering. He describes how the process of integrating AI in education is similar to the effects of increasing access to music recording and playback technologies. Now, there is \u201cmore music for everyone at much lower prices,\u201d he told me. Nonetheless, \u201cartists at the very top of the industry\u201d are increasingly the benefactors of \u201ca concentration of rewards.\u201d Taylor Swift is, as any current news feed can attest to, perhaps the most prolific embodiment of such phenomena. And professor Ghrist strives to make Penn an incubator of sorts for the \u201cTaylor Swifts of AI\u201d that seek avenues for academic growth, to actually be the \u201cleading edge where the best thrive.\u201d\nAnd to thrive in this discipline, aspiring AI mavens are off course by simply memorizing browser instructions in JavaScript and praying for a tech equivalent of the coveted Goldman Sachs internship. After all, studying AI is a philosophical pursuit: an inquiry into the nature of consciousness and ethics of creating sentient machines. It\u2019s also a political pursuit, for AI poses challenges in regulatory compliance. There are countless possible liabilities for even the most basic ChatGPT input, such as unprotected user data and violations of intellectual property rights. \u00a0\n\t\tGet our newsletter, DP Daybreak, delivered to your inbox every weekday morning.Needless to say, as you might have noticed in my earlier columns, I am not an AI major. I\u2019m not even enrolled in Penn Engineering. Am I, of all students, in the right to quash critics of the Penn AI major when I dropped AP Computer Science in high school (with no regrets)?\nYet, it\u2019s clearly irresponsible to follow the well-intentioned advice from tech capitalists when constant innovation is not particularly ideal for society. Maybe I\u2019m just afraid of a \"Black Mirror\"-esque dystopia, but there is a kind of ominous quality to the idea of highly skilled AI scientists off the reins. Penn, however, is cultivating an ecosystem that nurtures AI talent, albeit not by stifling the next Elon Musk or Sam Altman with red-tape-ridden academics; instead, Penn fosters ethically conscious innovation that addresses complex societal challenges. And so, the fact that I can engage with the Penn curricula across departments has a surprising beauty. The opportunity to become a part of this technological movement \u2014 or, dare I say, revolution \u2014 is the gift of studying AI at Penn.\nMRITIKA SENTHIL is a first year studying management and Russian and east European studies from Columbia, S.C.

          "title": "Akiva Berkowitz | An AI major by any other name ",
          "article_content": "Artificial intelligence is a topic we can\u2019t seem to get enough of. From frequent announcements regarding policies within classrooms to endless professors and visiting scholars weighing in on the unprecedented effect large language models will have on our lives, I\u2019m sure we\u2019ve all discussed to death how revolutionary ChatGPT has become for college students.\u00a0\nMany of us have even had the chance to firmly establish positions on whether the University should embrace the technology wholeheartedly or put in place safeguards to prevent it from eroding the value of a college education, but up until now, the vast majority of conversations have been on a non-technical level.\n\t\tThat all potentially changed in this past month when Penn announced their first Bachelor of Science in Engineering in AI. Thankfully for us, Penn has chosen to launch this interdisciplinary degree at the \u201coptimal time\u201d to \u201ccreate a society where AI isn\u2019t just a tool, but a fundamental force for good to advance society.\u201d But at what cost? To what extent should we be using college as an opportunity to hyperfocus on not just a certain field (computer science), but a field within a field? Majoring in AI panders to the pre-professionalism Penn is known for and removes many of the foundational elements of the field that underlie innovation.\u00a0\nIn an interesting recent LinkedIn post, David Magerman pondered the implications of a university building complete undergraduate curriculums around a \u201cmodern business tool that is a niche application of computer science, diverting students away from a broad education in computer science.\u201d He went on to ask pointedly, \u201cWhat's next? A Bachelor of Arts in Blogging from the Annenberg School? A Wharton BS in Quantitative Trading?\u201d\n\t\t\t\tSEE MORE FROM AKIVA BERKOWITZ:The newsletter is dead\ufeffIsrael under attack: What do you stand for?As a current computer science major, I\u2019ll admit the AI curriculum looks fascinating. There is such an array of eye-catching electives (from Deep Generative Models to Natural Language Processing) that, if I were doing my degree all over again, I suspect I would have been swayed to switch into the major. But as a recently graduated computer and information science friend put it, the degree \u201cseems like the cool parts of CIS\u201d without the heavier basics like operating systems, computer systems, and physics \u2014 building blocks on the entire computer domain. \u00a0\nThe question I ask myself is whether artificial intelligence is really enough of an independent field that it transcends computer science and necessitates its own major. Is the relatively new field of AI established enough, broad enough, and unique enough such that the skills we gain through taking just those mostly career-focused courses today will undoubtedly remain relevant in 30 years and justify the $84,600 a year sticker price? I simply wonder how likely it may be that AI will become so unrecognizable in 20 or even 10 years, given its breakneck pace of innovation, that students may have wished that their majors in college focused on more fundamental elements of the field that innovators keep turning back to for insight.\u00a0\n\tAside from long-term career effectiveness an AI degree would have compared to computer science or electrical engineering, Penn is known for its pre-professional student body, and this new major shows signs of that sentiment leaking into the curriculum as well. In contrast to the Penn Integrates Knowledge professorships that bring in academic leaders who deeply understand multiple fields to better spark insight between them, this new major filters various courses of study to pluck out the elements we find valuable today.\u00a0\nIn this line of thinking, maybe we should consider the true value of a groundbreaking Wharton degree in quant trading that would promise to \u201csculpt the financial moguls of tomorrow\u201d with unparalleled prowess in algorithmic trading strategies and quantitative analysis.\u00a0\nAll this is to say, I immediately understand the value the current AI concentration within the larger CIS curriculum has. And I appreciate the Ph.D. programs that take students to a higher level of understanding, once they\u2019ve taken the time in their undergraduate training to build the broad foundations. I simply remain curious of the true value an AI undergraduate degree offers us as students over other forms of study within the field and the certain level of indulgence in pre-professionalism that it plays into on Penn\u2019s campus. I truly hope that I\u2019m proven wrong.\nAKIVA BERKOWITZ is an Engineering junior studying computer science from Silver Spring, Md.

          "title": "Eric Najera | Penn must take action to enhance the dining experience",
          "article_content": "As busy college students, most of us do not have time to cook our own meals, and if you are anything like me, cooking is far from your forte. The hassle of having to go to the grocery store, cook, and clean can be time consuming and even more difficult when you\u2019re overwhelmed with classes, clubs, and homework. For the many students without access to a kitchen in their dorm, this presents an even bigger challenge. Luckily, college campuses have dining halls! Students simply swipe their card to get access to an all-you-care-to-eat dining experience. Dining halls provide easy access meals to students\u2014but what happens when that food is inedible?\nAs a picky eater, I know that simply because I do not like a dish does not mean it is unsafe to eat, but food with cockroaches and glass is unsafe for anyone. A seemingly obvious underlying assumption in dining is that food is safe to eat. College dining halls should be a place where students go to eat well-cooked, hairless, and insect-free food. However, that is not the case at Penn: There is a lack of responsibility to make sure the food is meeting basic standards for, let alone satisfying, all students.\u00a0\n\t\tMeal plans are far from cheap. For the sticker price, students would expect quality food, but they would be wrong. Both of the first-year student meal plan options cost $6,330, with the maximum amount of swipes being 296. Each meal swipe equates to roughly $17, which is about the same price as a Caniac Combo at Raising Cane's. As previously stated, Penn dining hall food is far from gourmet, and its price is too high for the quality delivered.\u00a0\nExpensive dining plan meals are not unique to Penn, but other Ivy League schools have similar prices for better quality food. Cornell University offers an unlimited meal plan, so students may visit the dining halls as much as they want with a fixed cost of $6,942 for food ranked second-best in the nation. So, for roughly 600 more dollars, Cornell students have access to unlimited meals and substantially better quality dining.\u00a0\n\t\t\t\tSEE MORE FROM ERIC NAJERA: \ufeffWe should be grateful to attend PennPenn clubs should have an assigned faculty member\ufeffAside from price and quality, weekend dining is another struggle. With the popular McClelland Sushi & Market and Houston Market being closed on Saturdays and the other dining halls closing at 8 p.m., food options are limited. Late-night study sessions means having to resort to local food places that remain open, and unlike nearby schools such as Drexel, our dining dollars do not work at off-campus restaurants and out-of-pocket money spent on takeout can add up quickly.\nBefore every school break, Sidechat is flooded with posts of excitement for home-cooked meals. In my classes, when asked what we are excited for, most students reply being able to eat good food. It is not uncommon for college students to miss their home-cooked meals, but when students are excited to actually eat food that is not served alongside insects, it signifies a problem.\n\tWith Penn\u2019s Bon App\u00e9tit contract still in place, we may not know how much Penn can do to change the dining experience. Safe, clean food should not be an unreasonable expectation. In order to enhance a student's experience outside the classroom, Penn must budget for an edible food experience for all students.\nERIC NAJERA is a College sophomore studying history from Rolling Meadows, Ill.

          "title": "Zaid Alsubaiei | Does Penn\u2019s diversity represent its sense of community?",
          "article_content": "We all know the typical \u201ctypes\u201d of high schoolers, the different clich\u00e9s: Where are my nerds at? But, another attribute of student groups that has become increasingly relevant in the 21st century United States is the diverse ethnic makeup of its population. And, frankly, do we as a campus mirror all that comes with that national trend of diversity?\nThink of the friends with whom you often hang out. Then, ask those friends with whom they usually go out. Finally, think of the groups you are a part of, the extracurriculars in which you partake. Notice a pattern?\n\t\t\u201c[D]espite increased opportunity to live and work in mixed-race settings, Americans remain racially segregated in their friendship patterns,\u201d a study published by the National Institutes of Health found. \u201cSpatial racism, cultural encapsulation, and personal choice are contributing factors for patterns of same-race friendships.\u201d\u00a0\nThis pattern seems to reflect the divisions present in Penn\u2019s social scene as well. Despite coming from all sorts of backgrounds across the world, the University\u2019s students appear to have unconsciously adopted a policy of self segregation. In other words, we like to \u201cstick to our own\u201d by socializing with others to whom we relate to on a cultural, ethnic, or religious basis. So, regardless of Penn\u2019s efforts to integrate people of differing experiences and beliefs, there still remains a degree of resistance by individuals themselves to cross those racial or cultural lines.\n\t\t\n\t\nAs a result, the potential for diversity of thought is threatened. A narrow mindset develops within these groups that students pledge to, and they effectively act as echo chambers that exacerbate already crippling political polarization. We relate to each other less, rely on our \u201cown\u201d more, and become less tolerant of the views, and thus experiences, of those who do not necessarily look, think, or speak like us.\nThis kind of thinking \u2014 whether manifested in the form of race, religion, or otherwise \u2014 has led to serious tension at times and enabled a distorted view of certain communities and how they experience Penn. I attribute part of that thinking not to the identity groups we are a part of, but to how much we value them over who we are as individuals.\n\tHomogenous communities definitely have their place in the college experience: They help ease our transition when we first arrive at Penn, and their role cannot be replaced. I say this as an international student myself, who had a hard time acclimating to an entirely different culture and, most radically, diet. Nonetheless, we should treat these organizations as an aid to finding belonging on campus, not a substitute for individual thought and expression.\nHowever, none of this means individuals can\u2019t agree or always need to separate themselves from the group. The use of a large, collective voice can benefit our campus much more than we realize. What is important to note is that there lies a clear distinction between acknowledging the views of others and forcing ourselves to accept those views for the sake of conformity.\nThere is nothing wrong with disagreeing with the majority, whether it is one against two or one against a nation (though some may try to tell you otherwise). As long as you are respectful and driven by a desire to learn rather than defend, there are no limits on what perspective you may question. So, challenge your beliefs, reevaluate your viewpoint, challenge that of others (no matter who they are), and then reevaluate yourself again. It\u2019ll be hard at first, to express your precise, genuine thoughts without fear. But, remember that you\u2019re not alone (I struggle sometimes myself) and that it\u2019s a process you won\u2019t always get right.\n\t\tGet our newsletter, DP Daybreak, delivered to your inbox every weekday morning.The hardest part of breaking out of groupthink, after realizing it, is talking about it. My advice? Take the plunge and never look back. The next time you are in a group and the majority agrees with an idea you don\u2019t like, let it be known. Talk about it and explain why you think the way you do. Don\u2019t worry if some get offended or others simply do not agree; it is normal and, in fact, expected.\u00a0\nNever forget that disputes you engage in are an opportunity, not a challenge, and our differences are enlightening, not threatening. Only then will we begin to understand and appreciate each other more as unique actors in a truly historic community.\nZAID ALSUBAIEI is a College first year studying economics from Al-Khobar, Saudi Arabia.

          "article_content": "I downloaded Sidechat this fall after my friends sent me too many screenshots of funny memes or jokes posted on the anonymous app. I figured that doing so would simply remove the middleman. I was already being exposed to the same jokes, memes, comments and judgements as those on the app anyway \u2026 right?\u00a0\nIn December, I returned home for reading days and fell into an easy pattern of studying. Nothing I did was wildly exciting or social, but I instead found myself enjoying the routine and satisfaction of productivity. During my study breaks, I would scroll on Sidechat \u2014 and from the comfort of my home, I felt myself spiraling into anxious dread about returning to Penn. Each time I opened the app, I was faced with a barrage of posts all echoing the same sentiment: Penn is awful and depressing. Without a second thought, I accepted those posts as fact, and in doing so, I allowed Sidechat to have more power than it deserves. In other words, I subscribed to the complaining culture that is pervasive on Sidechat.\u00a0\n\t\tUsing Sidechat, especially without intentional thought, is a way of looking at Penn through hypercritical glasses. Perhaps this is because negativity has been normalized and cynicism gets more upvotes. To some extent, this pessimistic messaging is diluted with the insertion of mildly entertaining memes or jokes, but the result is still the same. With each scroll, Sidechat is perpetuating a defeatist perspective of Penn.\u00a0\nSo, I arrived back at Penn to take my final exam: openly unhappy about returning to what I thought would be a bleak campus as a result of discourse on Sidechat. But to my surprise, it was not horrific, and I was able to enjoy my weekend of studying just as I had my week at home. The sheer volume of disheartening posts on Sidechat had clouded my perspective and ability to see the best in the situation. Sure, I was becoming one with a Huntsman GSR while others were at home enjoying break, but on the other hand, I was with my friends and able to have a sleepy campus all to myself.\n\t\t\t\tAs is the case with most other social media platforms, Sidechat is consumed passively and without a second thought \u2014 it\u2019s used to pass time, curb boredom, and satiate our addictions to our phones. And yet, students are absorbing and internalizing content more quickly than they can truly digest it.\u00a0\nGiven the bandwagon culture on Sidechat, users often build off of one another, creating a chaotic, and often dismal, echo chamber that does not truly represent life at Penn. Whether or not college is the best four years of your life, it is at least what you make of it, and Sidechat enables students to feel like victims of an unknown cause. For those who are actually struggling, Sidechat acts not as a productive outlet, but rather as a meta ether that provides no remedy other than the satisfaction that others are unhappy too.\u00a0\n\tSince winter break, I have in fact deleted Sidechat and am all the better for it. I still get sent the best and the brightest jokes by my friends, but I am no longer overwhelmed by unsolicited complaints on an hourly basis. Without Sidechat, my thoughts on the housing lottery, the floods in the Quad, and upcoming midterms are completely my own. Deleting Sidechat may not be for everyone, but it\u2019s imperative for those who chose to use Sidechat to take a more critical view of what is being circulated and evaluate whether or not they are benefiting from it. It may just change the way they see Penn.\u00a0\nELIZA CARROLL is a College first year studying international relations and art history from Greenwich, Conn.

          "title": "Cathy Li and Liala Sofi | History can\u2019t repeat itself; stand with Chinatown",
          "article_content": "Students for the Preservation of Chinatown protested outside the Board of Trustees meeting held at the Inn at Penn on Mar. 3, 2023. \nA few weeks ago, the streets of Chinatown came to life with firecrackers and lion dances ringing in the year of the dragon. As you walk through the brightly colored 40-foot paifang \u2014 known to most as Chinatown\u2019s Friendship Gate \u2014 you enter into a cultural oasis that has stood strong in the heart of Philadelphia for nearly 150 years. Beyond this fixture, Chinatown serves as a home to nearly 3,000 residents and numerous family-owned businesses, restaurants, shops, and community organizations. Whether you are going to Ken\u2019s Seafood Restaurant for a fun night out or Heng Fa for groceries, Chinatown feels like home.\u00a0\nUnfortunately, this community has been under constant attack for decades and is once again facing the threat of displacement and gentrification from a plan to develop an arena for the Philadelphia 76ers merely a block away. We firmly stand with the Students for the Preservation of Chinatown and urge you to do the same. \u00a0\n\t\tSince the early 1900s, Chinatown has been a victim of gentrification often driven by predatory infrastructure projects. In 1932, the construction of subway infrastructure at Ridge and Eighth streets \u2014 and the subsequent development of the Vine Street Expressway from 1957 to 1991 \u2014 resulted in the destruction of buildings and severe divisions within the community. Bringing in noise and pollution, the expressway eroded neighborhoods and people's quality of life. This was not Chinatown's sole battle, however, as it also faced multiple proposals of developments for a federal prison in 1992, a baseball stadium in 2000, and a casino in 2008.\u00a0\nThe story of Philadelphia's Chinatown mirrors other Chinatowns across the nation. Amid the 1994 fiscal crisis in Washington, D.C., then-Washington Wizards owner Abe Pollin negotiated a deal for the downtown Capital One Arena, where the city covered pre-development costs to acquire and demolish properties. Entrepreneurs in Washington's Chinatown voiced concerns about prices of real estate skyrocketing and parking impacts on businesses in the area. A decade later, most Chinese residents were forced to move out due to unaffordable housing. The parking shortage led to the closure of the last Chinese grocery store, accelerating the decline of the Chinese American population in the area to fewer than 400 residents today. Ironically, as D.C.\u2019s arena now relocates to the suburbs, the community is left behind, having endured irreversible destruction while in the midst of its recovery from the pandemic.\u00a0\n\t\t\t\tMORE FROM LIALA SOFI AND CATHY LI:Liala Sofi | The hypocrisy of billionaire philanthropistsCathy Li | Philadelphia\u2019s changing tastesIn New York\u2019s Chinatown, threats of displacement and economic insecurity also loom high. In 2021, the Museum of Chinese in America accepted a donation of $35 million in support of a borough-based jail complex which would displace Chinese American working-class people in the area. On top of that, its board executives were connected to the closing of the last unionized restaurant, beloved Jing Fong banquet hall, and construction of luxury towers that are actively raising rent and real estate taxes in the area.\nIn Philadelphia, the current 76Place project is being developed by 76 DevCo, an initiative by 76ers managing partners Josh Harris, David Blitzer, and David Adelman. Adelman is at the forefront of the construction of the arena and has promised not to displace the residents or businesses in Chinatown, but his past actions speak louder than his current words. Adelman works closely with Brett Altman, who also owns the University City Townhomes, and was a key figure behind the demolition and end of affordable housing in the West Philadelphia area that was previously known as the \"Black Bottom.\u201d This constant cycle of displacing residents and communities that have lived in the area for generations must end, and we must be the voice to make this happen.\n\tDevelopers of the project have stated that the arena will \u201cserve as a model for an equitable & inclusive community,\u201d yet there is not a single mention of Chinatown in the proposal. Efforts to ensure communities can benefit from this project read as empty promises when nearly 95% of residents, business owners, and visitors oppose the arena\u2019s construction.\nMany questions posed by residents have also gone unanswered by 76 DevCo. How will restaurants and small businesses in the surrounding area be protected? Who will clean the streets after huge events?\u00a0\nPreserving Philadelphia's architectural heritage demands careful consideration in urban development, but the development of the arena does the exact opposite \u2014 jeopardizing accessible low-income and senior housing complexes, healthcare clinics, and schools for children.\nPenn has direct ties to the developers in the area, and students should be cognizant of the situation. Adelman currently sits on Penn Medicine Board of Trustees and is the CEO of Campus Apartments, which houses many Penn students off-campus. But more importantly, Penn students are directly and indirectly involved in the Chinatown community, whether that be Penn Lions performing all throughout the city for Lunar New Year, or student groups like SPOC organizing initiatives to honor traditions celebrating the multi-ethnic communities that reside there.\u00a0\nDespite what greedy developers may suggest, Chinatown is not an ethnic theme park but a home. It\u2019s more than just a place to eat, it\u2019s a support network and a cultural hub for immigrants and visitors alike.\nIn the face of ongoing threats, Chinatown has demonstrated remarkable resilience and activism, advocating for the needs of all diverse communities of color that are integrated into the cultural fabric of our city. The next time you are in Chinatown, take a look around at all the place has to offer. Venture into Ebisu for some home decor and enjoy a Mochinut donut as you shop. Come by Dae Bak for soul-nourishing Korean barbecue. The opportunities to support your favorite restaurants and local businesses are endless.\nPlease don't turn a blind eye to what is happening outside the Penn bubble. Pay attention to what SPOC and other organizers are doing in the fight for the preservation of Chinatown. Educate yourself on what is going on in Chinatowns across the country. If you can, participate in programming like Crane Chinatown Community Center art exhibitions or Show Your Love for Chinatown events to learn more about the challenges facing the neighborhood. Sign petitions. \u00a0\nAdorned with dragon motifs, and gorgeous ornamental roof tiles, the Friendship Archway is not only an architectural masterpiece, but a labor of love \u2014\u00a0created for community by community. The engineers and artisans from Tianjin, China \u2014 Philadelphia\u2019s sister city \u2014 came together with residents and the city of Philadelphia to fund and invest in Chinatown, and you should too.\u00a0\nThe next time you walk through the gate, remember that the fight for Philadelphia\u2019s Chinatown, and Chinatowns everywhere, is not over.

The former president of Harvard, Claudine Gay, was ousted in part due to plagiarism concerns, and Business Insider found that former MIT professor Neri Oxman (the wife of billionaire Bill Ackman, who led the campaign against Gay) \u201cstole sentences and whole paragraphs from Wikipedia, other scholars and technical documents in her academic writing.\u201d\n\t\tTo be clear, I believe that academic dishonesty at Penn \u2014 going against community standards that your professor has explicitly outlined \u2014 is unacceptable, and that we should be doing more to penalize and prevent it.\nNevertheless, we must also acknowledge that academic dishonesty is understandable, in that we can piece together students\u2019 rationales when they do cheat, and even sympathize with them in some cases.\n\t\t\t\tSEE MORE FROM CAROLINE MAGDOLEN:\ufeffThe Rat Kings of PennThere\u2019s no better time for climate education\ufeffTo dissuade academic dishonesty, we employ sayings like, \u201cIt will only hurt you in the long run to cheat,\u201d or \u201cYou\u2019re taking advantage of other students who've completed their work fairly.\u201d This is true in some circumstances. If you\u2019re an aspiring quant and you\u2019re asking ChatGPT to calculate all of the derivatives on your MATH 1400 homework, it\u2019s going to show: First in your exams for the class, then in every math class you take thereafter, and especially in your future career. And if MATH 1400 is curved, your dishonest success capitalizes on the honest failures of others \u2014 not cool.\nBut this is not true in all cases. Jane* was a first year in her spring term when she was taking CIS 1210: Data Structures and Algorithms \u2014 a famously challenging CIS course \u2014 with Rajiv Gandhi, a famously challenging professor.\u00a0\n\tShe cheated on her coding assignment late into the semester, and as per the professor\u2019s policy, received a -300/100 on the submitted homework and zeros on all previously submitted homework, receiving a D as her final grade in the course.\nBut Jane believes that what is more important to her story is not what happened, but why it happened.\u00a0\n\u201cWhat drove me to make a bad decision? Why are [these classes] so infamous? It\u2019s because of notorious policies where you cannot collaborate on many assignments. You are given long problem sets to do, on your own, each week, with desperate students in office hour queues that are two to four hours long. Many times, you will go to the TA and not get a clear answer. It is a profoundly isolating situation, particularly for freshmen just entering college, and that\u2019s what drives well-meaning people to cheat.\u201d\nBased on my conversation with Jane, it seemed that she felt isolated at the time and was struggling to reach out for the support that she needed, both in CIS 1210 and at Penn as a whole. And given the limited support Jane could receive from TAs and her instructor, backtracking her friend\u2019s code felt more conducive to her learning than doing nothing.\nJane expressed a lot of remorse over what happened, and said that she still has a lot of respect for Rajiv, maintaining a good relationship with him to this day. She was also grateful that Rajiv was willing to handle this internally, since a low grade in the class looks better than a formal statement on her transcript, detailing her violation of academic integrity.\n\u201cI deserved to be punished harshly,\u201d Jane said. \u201cBut the collaboration policies of these introductory courses, and the punishment I received, wrecked my self-esteem and my early college experience. I felt that there was no way out.\u201d\nAccording to Jane, Rajiv's philosophy is to \"let go of your grades early: the sooner you stop caring about your GPA and start caring about learning, the better.\" She agrees with this philosophy, especially since he curves his courses generously, but sees this as out of touch with the realities of many Penn students.\nAfter students have prioritized perfecting their grades and resumes (and have been praised for it) in high school, those habits won\u2019t get undone overnight. Even at Penn, there are many institutions and accolades that continue to reward \u201cperfect\u201d performance over pursuing difficult academic disciplines, experimenting, and invariably messing up sometimes.\nFrankly, for a pre-med student in computer science (a track which Jane was considering at the time), the adage that \u201ccheating will hurt you in the long run\u201d skill-wise doesn\u2019t hold much water. The skillset of a future doctor and a software engineer just don\u2019t overlap enough. What can hurt a pre-med in the long run is a low GPA.\nAnd while there are some students for whom projects, internships, and technical interviews will get them a lot further in guaranteeing their success, this is not true for everyone. For many preprofessional students who may want to challenge themselves with a major or minor in CIS, they risk getting shut out of the study altogether.\nWhat frustrates me most about this entire situation is not that such harsh action was taken, but that it appears ineffective in tackling the issue at hand. If a student wanted to cheat, they could just take CIS 1600 or CIS 1210 during a different semester, when a different instructor was in charge and penalties were anecdotally known for being less harsh.\nWhile Jane\u2019s actions were clearly wrong, I can\u2019t help thinking that she was just the unlucky example that had to face the music, and she said as much in our interview: \u201cEveryone cheats in this class. You don\u2019t survive [CIS 1600 or CIS 1210] without talking to people, it just depends on whether you get caught. That doesn\u2019t make cheating okay, but it does mean that we need to rethink how these courses operate.\u201d\nSo, what can we do so that not everyone cheats?\nThis is a complex question, and there is no easy answer. It is crucial that as we frame the issue of academic integrity violations, we look at both the violations themselves and the root motivations that drive them \u2014 these actions are not taking place in a vacuum.\u00a0\nAcademic integrity violations these days are, to an extent, simply easier to commit. ChatGPT has led to a surge in \u201cunfair advantage\u201d violations. And even before generative AI, the pandemic had uprooted our usual test-taking environment. Now that classes are in person again, we no longer need to have take-home or open-Internet exams, but these still persist in some classes, and are easier to cheat on. Penn, given its history of fraudulent alumni, isn\u2019t going to be a place where professors can blindly trust students to refrain from cheating when presented with the option, so professors should take some responsibility for leveling the playing field in the classroom too.\u00a0\nJulie Nettleton, the executive director of Penn\u2019s Center for Community Standards and Accountability (CSA), relayed over email that CSA already works closely with schools and centralized resources at Penn to discuss how to proctor exams, and with faculty to discuss exams, syllabi language, and classroom policies.\nWhat constitutes a violation itself is currently not standard across classes, or even across different sections of the same class. How to handle a concern of academic integrity falls to the professor first \u2014 this is how Jane completed CIS 1210 with a lower grade, rather than a formal sanction from the CSA. It makes sense to delegate this responsibility to professors: It is more efficient than having the CSA handle every case, and professors should have the freedom to decide what constitutes cheating in their classrooms.\nHowever, this does open the door to students deliberately choosing sections of a course with professors that have more relaxed academic integrity policies. Conversely, some professors can be overly harsh, to the point where they are acting unfairly towards their students.\u00a0\nJill*, another student that I interviewed for this article, was falsely accused by her professor of collaborating on her final exam with her peers. At the start of winter break, the professor sent a class-wide email imploring those who worked together on the take-home exam to turn themselves in or have the matter escalated. Jill recalls that for students that turned themselves in, the professor lowered their grades accordingly \u2014 everyone else was reported to the CSA.\nIn the end, Jill\u2019s name was cleared, but she was assigned a case manager that seemed to have assumed she was guilty by default. As the case progressed, many of the details that the professor used to build the case against her appeared superfluous \u2014 for example, she and her friends had all rounded to the same decimal place in their work. Jill suspects that the escalation may have been personal: she had previously asked the professor, on behalf of the class, if he could make changes to his teaching style to facilitate learning.\nIt seems wrong to me that a professor could accuse a student and cause such extensive stress when in the end, Jill turned out to be innocent. It reminded me of some other methods that professors use to catch students cheating, such as Turnitin\u2019s flawed AI detector.\nPart of the solution to rampant academic dishonesty may also lie in expanding our vocabulary to discuss the issue, as John McWhorter pointed out in The New York Times. A class-wide cheating ring, direct plagiarism of original ideas from a paper as one\u2019s own, and copying a line of someone\u2019s code all constitute academic dishonesty, but range broadly in terms of severity and \u201cease of catching.\u201d However, this is rarely reflected in academic integrity policies.\u00a0\nIt can be awkward to suggest that some forms of dishonesty are worse than others, and more awkward still to draw the line between different punishments for different violations, but we must still have these conversations.\u00a0\nWhat should constitute dishonesty at all? When speaking with Jane, she would often circle back to how isolating it was to work alone on her assignments as a first year in introductory computer science courses, particularly as a woman in STEM. Every day, she would walk out of class \u201cfeeling way worse about [her]self.\u201d Now exploring chemistry, physics, and biology courses, she greatly appreciates the change in her academic environment, where students are encouraged to openly collaborate. The grade medians in chemistry are similar to those in CIS (which is to say, not great), but Jane is not as stressed as she was in CIS 1210, since she studies with her friends, and they can struggle and ask for help together.\u00a0\nWhile it was dishonest of Jane to copy code when it was against CIS 1210 policy, perhaps CIS majors and minors would learn more from the course if they were in a more collaborative environment to begin with. Jane has suggested that CIS 1210 should find a middle ground where students can learn from each other, but not be overly reliant on collaboration to perform well on exams.\u00a0\nShe also argues that there should be more opportunities for students to admit to academic dishonesty \u2014 through a friend at Stanford, she heard that at the end of a computer science class, students can select the assignments they have cheated on and receive a negative score on them, or risk facing more uncertain penalties if they are later caught.\u00a0\n\u201cThis policy gives people a second chance to do the right thing, and I do believe that you learn from an experience if you own up to it,\u201d Jane said.\nDeliberations over how best to address academic dishonesty can go on without end, but unfortunately this column must do just that. So here, I want to leave you with a reminder of what I said at the beginning: Academic dishonesty is unacceptable, but it is also understandable.\n\t\tGet our newsletter, DP Daybreak, delivered to your inbox every weekday morning.The hard, but necessary, solution to \u201ceveryone cheating\u201d is taking a good look at the stories behind academic dishonesty, and listening to the students involved with sympathy.

          "title": "Jack Lakis | What we can learn from Penn\u2019s college ranking",
          "article_content": "Last fall, a plethora of new results from U.S. News & World Report, Wall Street Journal, and Forbes elevated Penn in their national college rankings. Nearly every list places Penn among the top 10, some going as far as placing the University among the top five. This universal growth resulted from a key change in most of these sources\u2019 metrics: greater consideration given to postgraduate salaries.\nPenn famously has one of the highest-earning alumni bodies in the country. Starting salaries for Penn graduates are often considered the highest in the Ivy League. By mid-career, the average Penn alum is raking in $165,000 annually, while the national average for a college graduate caps out at $74,000.\n\t\tPenn draws a great deal of prestige from its potential to produce high earners, which is a direct result of our school\u2019s preprofessional culture. Nearly 50% of all Penn graduates enter one of two career fields: consulting or finance. This pipeline allows most Penn alumni to matriculate into high-paying jobs shortly after graduation.\nI\u2019m usually a defender of preprofessionalism. It\u2019s crucial that Penn graduates are able to find good jobs, and high salary potential is an immense advantage. But those jobs aren\u2019t everything. Many universities are making gains in rankings and name recognition based on alumni outcomes in public service careers.\n\t\t\t\t\ufeffSEE MORE FROM JACK LAKIS:\ufeffDo we all hate Penn?Staying focused after Magill's resignation\ufeffFor example, Harvard University boasts about its eight presidential alumni. However, when 1968 Wharton graduate Donald Trump was elected president, Penn mostly ignored his history with the school. Given his proximity to controversy and his unconventional political history, Penn\u2019s bump in prestige was limited by Trump\u2019s election. Our second closest claim to the White House is the University\u2019s relationship with President Joe Biden and the opening of the Penn Biden Center. I argue that this is as far as Penn\u2019s ties to the presidency will go. Nowadays, Penn\u2019s laser focus on professional development might repel students who will one day have presidential potential.\nComparable institutions to Penn have high-earning graduates and prestigious placements throughout the government, nonprofit sector, and the advocacy space. For example, Georgetown University feeds graduates into congressional offices and many Fulbright programs. Princeton University also regularly features its flashy roster of graduates in powerful political offices. These universities maintain a strong presence in the private sector but are also actively represented in government positions.\n\tIn these examples, the institution itself sponsors an undergraduate school dedicated to public service. At Georgetown, it\u2019s the School of Foreign Service, while at Princeton the role is filled by the School of Public and International Affairs.\nI propose that Penn follow suit and create a fifth undergraduate school dedicated to public affairs. This new school could absorb Penn\u2019s wildly popular social science programs, like PPE (Philosophy, Politics and Economics), Political Science, and Economics. Currently, most students in these majors are scooped up by consulting firms and investment banks. If these students were given an intentional focus on service and social responsibility, perhaps they could feel empowered to use their degrees in a more meaningful way.\nThe least Penn can do is expand its current effort to bridge the gap between social science degree seekers and careers in government and nonprofits. It\u2019s crucial that our student body actively engages with the robust policy infrastructure that Penn has already made available: Civic House, Perry World House, opportunities like Penn in Washington, and extracurricular engagements offered by the Government and Politics Association. From what I\u2019ve seen, these resources are underutilized at Penn. By snubbing them, Penn students are working against the general interests of the University to gain prestige.\n\t\tGet our newsletter, DP Daybreak, delivered to your inbox every weekday morning.Besides, it's about more than just rankings. We have the potential to empower our students to become leaders in society. TIME Magazine ranks Penn as the third-best college for aspiring leaders. However, the article states its rationale for this placement as a concentration of graduates in business careers. Other chart-topping schools on this list were noted for their programs in law, medicine, and more.\nUltimately, private sector homogeneity marks one of Penn\u2019s key weaknesses. As we move forward, Penn has a duty to educate leaders in more than one field. If Penn strengthened its programs in civic engagement, more graduates would be inclined to pursue roles in government and could elevate Penn\u2019s cultural stature. We should be known for more than salaries. We can do more than business.\nJACK LAKIS is a College first year studying political science from Kennesaw, Ga.

          "title": "Mia Vesely | Black Penn is vibrant this month and every month",
          "article_content": "As of late, most of my columns have focused on things I take issue with: Whether it\u2019s Liz Magill\u2019s resignation and the threats to free speech on campus, or the lack of racial diversity in Panhellenic sororities. I haven't highlighted the things that I truly appreciate and, more specifically, the places in which I\u2019ve found community at Penn.\nLast February, I argued that Black history is important for everyone. Education surrounding Black people, their lives, and their contributions should be integrated into the standard curriculum. Black Penn shows up and shows out every month, but this month in particular, there are many events and ways that Penn student organizations uplift the community and come together.\u00a0\n\t\tIt would be impossible to touch on all of these amazing events and their impacts, but I\u2019d like to paint a picture of some of these groups and their initiatives during this month and beyond. Planning for these events takes months. For example, when Descendants of Afro-Americans at Penn (DAAP) \u2014 a club founded just last year \u2014 put on their first-ever gala on Feb. 1 to kick off the month, you better believe that the event was well-planned and executed.\u00a0\nThe gala \u2014 Red Carpet For A Cause \u2014 supported the Sickle Cell Disease Association of America's Philadelphia and Delaware Valley Chapter. The night included catered food, live performances from student groups like The Inspiration, wonderful community, and beautiful decor\u2014even including an ice sculpture of the DAAP logo. Over $1,700 was raised in support of the foundation.\n\t\t\t\tSEE MORE FROM MIA VESELY:\ufeffI dropped sorority rush and I\u2019m gladFirst Liz Magill, next free speechWhen asked about the impacts of the event, College sophomore and DAAP founding member Clarke Dickens said, \u201cWe wanted to bring the community together for a great cause, especially a cause that affects a lot of African Americans and Black people more broadly.\u201d\nSickle cell disease occurs in about one in every 365 Black babies born in the United States. The percentage of Black people who carry the trait is even higher, with one in 13 Black babies being born as carriers.\n\tDickens is not just involved with DAAP, but is also on the boards for QBlack and Shea Collective.\nThese clubs are all part of something commonly dubbed \u201cBlack Penn,\u201d which focuses on so many different aspects of identity. From cultural organizations like Penn African Student Association (PASA), to preprofessional organizations like Black Wharton and the Black Pre-Law Association (BPLA), to community service organizations like the NAACP, all of these organizations put an emphasis on service both inside the Penn community and out.\u00a0\nFor example, Campus Curlz \u2014 a club I serve on the board of \u2014 is, at first glance, a club centered around uplifting natural hair and embracing positivity. \u00a0But underlying hair mask making events and movie nights, there is a strong commitment to service. Just this month, the community service committee held an event where we made Valentine\u2019s Day cards for senior citizens at Mercy Life West Philadelphia.\nService by board members is a requirement to be part of funding organizations like UMOJA \u2014 the umbrella funding organization for Black clubs \u2014 and even beyond that, many clubs center service in every activity they partake in. Whether you\u2019re on the board of a club or not, there are many service opportunities available and encouraged.\nWhen asked what they wish people knew about Black Penn, Dickens said, \u201cClubs should make an effort to include grad students, it makes all the difference. I\u2019m able to say, \u2018This is what I would look like coming here for grad school,\u2019 and it can even offer opportunities for mentorship.\u201d\nWhat seems to drive Black Penn is first and foremost the students, then the supportive and involved faculty, as well as the local partnerships and opportunities the clubs find, build, and pursue for themselves. Many members of the DAAP board are native to Philadelphia, so that makes their work even more personal.\nWhile Black students do take initiative to realize what they need and create the spaces they want to see, there is so much room for improvement on behalf of Penn: whether it\u2019s stratifying the way funding is given to these clubs \u2014 they often can\u2019t fund silverware in UMOJA meetings if it can be provided elsewhere \u2014 or improving the cultural spaces available to students (we were promised the ARCH \u2018building,\u2019 not the ARCH \u2018basement\u2019). In months like February, Penn aims to spotlight their Black students. I just wish this recognition of the incredible community Black students forged for themselves, when they initially didn\u2019t see it on campus, came year-round.\n\t\tGet our newsletter, DP Daybreak, delivered to your inbox every weekday morning.Events like DAAP's gala happen every month, and it\u2019s important not to understate the role these organizations play in making Penn a welcoming and accepting place for students from marginalized backgrounds.\nI was happy to see Faces of Black Penn \u2014 a Black-run publication \u2014 highlighted in the DP last week. I hope people continue to uplift the work of these student groups going forward and make space to give all students their roses.

          "title": "Bernadine Kumi | I joined a sorority and I\u2019m glad",
          "article_content": "I\u2019ll be honest: I was not a fan of Greek life when I first got to Penn. My perception of Greek life was influenced by growing up in the South, mainly in suburban Georgia. This included a sorority scene of girls with fake spray tans and little to no personality. The images of sorority girls from the University of Georgia and Alabama screamed no diversity, which made me wary of joining a sorority at Penn. Being a First-Generation, Low-Income (FGLI) student made me especially hesitant. Even more so, coming from a Ghanaian household, the notion of a sorority was immediately dismissed as something against our Christian values. Thus, during my first year, I knew I would never, and I mean never, join a sorority.\u00a0\nHowever, by the beginning of sophomore year, my mindset began to change. After a year on campus, I had found a solid community of a small group of friends. But beyond that, I felt that I did not really know anyone. I couldn\u2019t name more than 20 people in my grade. Penn is known for being a networking school, and the \u201cSocial Ivy,\u201d so I began to question just how much I had taken advantage of that. That, along with most of the underclassmen party scene revolving around fraternities, made the idea of rushing even more appealing.\u00a0\n\t\tSo while most people were beginning their sophomore year with the friends they already had, I began to look for additional friends. My twin sister, who also goes to Penn, and I began attending open rush events, talking to sophomores in sororities, and involving ourselves in more social events. Over the next few months, my days consisted of talking to many girls, going to dinners, and putting myself out there in a way that I had been hesitant to do before. I made new friends, met fellow sophomores also in search of a bigger community, and found myself loving the idea of joining a sorority.\u00a0\nBut what made me even more eager was just how inclusive and diverse sororities were at Penn, more so than I had been expecting\u2014especially the off-campus sorority I ended up joining, OAX. I was still wary about rushing, but as soon as I got to the first event, I immediately felt comfortable. There were girls with different interests, passions, economic backgrounds, and personalities. Not a single conversation felt forced. Every girl I met had a unique and authentic story, and I felt like I could talk to them for hours.\n\t\t\t\tSEE MORE FROM BERNADINE KUMI:\ufeffDining hall workers at Penn Hillel demand better treatment from UniversityI was especially captivated by BLOAX (Black OAX), a community within OAX that includes fellow girls of Ghanaian descent and other Black girls who provided me with guidance on navigating Penn as a Black woman. OAX also has other smaller communities, such as LatinOAX and RainbOAX. Being able to find other people with similar backgrounds made the choice to join a sorority that much easier.\u00a0\nAs a FGLI student and Questbridge scholar, the idea of paying high dues out of my minimal work paychecks every month was unfathomable. I knew that joining a sorority would pose another financial burden, and even though I was loving the OAX community, the idea of paying dues scared me. Yet once again, OAX and other sororities surprised me with their understanding and financial transparency. They worked with me to develop an affordable monthly payment plan so that I, like every other girl interested in rushing, could also enjoy being in a sorority.\u00a0\n\tSince the morning of Bid Day when I got \u201cthe call,\u201d I know that I truly made the right decision by joining a sorority, for not only my social life but my professional life too. This past fall, I was able to land a summer internship in Los Angeles with the help of my grand-big. I was also able to prepare for my interview with girls in my sorority, who gave me the confidence I needed to land the opportunity. As a Black woman and FGLI student, I have truly benefited from joining Greek life. I hope students who are hesitant to rush, just as I once was, will see my experience and how transformative it can be. I hope others \u2014 whether they are Black women, FGLI students, or just Penn students in search of a greater community \u2014 can do the same.\nBERNADINE KUMI is a College junior studying political science and legal studies and history from Roswell, Ga.

          "title": "Jessey Shin | \u201cWhy is your pre-major advisor so much better than mine?\u201d",
          "article_content": "Columnist Jessey Shin explores the problem of disparate advising quality in the College and argues \nfor a more standardized experience.\u201cMy advisor lied to me?\u201d\nI remember someone saying this to me in complete disbelief, but I can\u2019t say I\u2019m surprised. Advisors can be as misleading as they are helpful, and this is a widespread problem that needs addressing.\n\t\tIn the College, students typically have between 15 and 20 credits outside of their primary major to meet the graduation requirement. These are used to fulfill general education requirements, pursue a second major or minor, or take elective courses that align with a student\u2019s interests.\nThe freedom to pursue one\u2019s intellectual pursuits is, of course, one of the draws of the College. I am looking to pursue two majors myself, in somewhat interconnected but disparate fields of study: the flexibility offered by the curriculum allows me to explore these interests without taking an obscene number of classes.\n\t\t\t\tSEE MORE FROM JESSEY SHIN:Making a case for the less popular college housesNavigating the maze of Penn's resources\ufeffThe problem is few students go into their first year knowing which major they would like to pursue, much less exactly which courses to take.\u00a0\nThe College puts a lot of effort into informing incoming students about the curriculum and what they have to offer, such as through the Compass module on Canvas that gives a foray into some aspects of the College experience (something that other schools do not offer). However, the sheer number of options can be overwhelming, giving rise to a unique need for personalized, one-on-one guidance. This is where pre-major advisors come in.\u00a0\n\tPre-major advisors, assigned to each student before they start their first semester at Penn, are a vital resource for College students. They guide students through the course selection process, encouraging and helping them as they explore their various interests and eventually settle on a major.\nI can say that I have had a relatively good experience with my pre-major advisor. However, I also found that some of the advice offered was not fully applicable to my circumstance, because of the recent transition from Penn InTouch to Path@Penn.\nOther students, however, are not as lucky. I have heard stories about advisors making their students cry, spreading misinformation, jeopardizing their advisees\u2019 course registration, you name it.\nIn an interview, one student (who requested anonymity) shared that they have had trouble reaching their pre-major advisor from the get-go. College students must meet with their advisor one-on-one to get their course registration hold lifted; without this, they are not eligible to participate in advance registration. The student was only able to reach their advisor a day or so before the deadline and has continued to have trouble with availability.\nOf course, their pre-major advisor experience was less than ideal. \u201cHer guidance wasn\u2019t so much guidance as it was looking at the boxes and seeing if I checked them,\u201d they said. \u201cI don\u2019t think I would feel comfortable going to her for personal issues, such as which major to pursue or how to explore [some of my interests], because I don\u2019t think she would point me [in] the right direction.\u201d Instead, they had been utilizing their PennCAP advisor (available for FGLI students) for these concerns.\nOn the other hand, some students are able to form a positive relationship with their advisor and find that they are helpful in navigating their interests. Rishi Dadlani, a College first year, described his advisor as \u201cfriendly and helpful. He gave me his phone number and told me to contact him if I [had] any questions \u2026 If I saw him around campus, I would say hi, and he always sends us a beginning-of-semester email.\u201d\n\t\tGet our newsletter, DP Daybreak, delivered to your inbox every weekday morning.This disparity in advising quality means that some students are at a great disadvantage compared to others. While some advisors are able to \u201cpoint students in the right direction,\u201d helping them take the right step forward in their college experience, others fall short. Their advisees must navigate the complicated process of learning about the majors, gen-ed requirements, and figuring out (the surprisingly difficult) advance registration process on their own.\nWhen done right, the freedom of the College curriculum can allow students to truly delve into their academic interests and eventually settle on the right path for them. However, that process requires a lot of research and planning that is supposed to be aided by a pre-major advisor. For incoming first years who are unfamiliar with the landscape at Penn and underclassmen students, this disparity in advising quality poses a challenge. Penn must ensure that all students are able to best utilize the resources at their disposal, and the first place to start is with the guidance they receive.\nJESSEY SHIN is a College first-year studying sociology and communications from Seongnam-si, South Korea.

          "article_content": "Guest Columnist Raheem Williams recommends three books for the Penn community to engage with this Black History Month.Dear Fellow Quakers,\nAs we celebrate Black History Month, it's crucial to recognize the multifaceted nature of the Black American experience. This month offers an opportunity to delve into the depths of history: exploring narratives that challenge, inspire, and provoke thought. In the spirit of true academic inquiry and in honor of this significant month, I wish to highlight a selection of works by Black authors whose perspectives might diverge from the more commonly embraced interpretations of Black history and culture.\n\t\tIn recommending these texts, my intention is not to endorse every opinion expressed by the authors, but to underscore the importance of engaging with a diversity of viewpoints. These authors challenge us to look beyond the prevailing orthodoxy and to question the narratives that have become commonplace within academic circles. They remind us that the Black American experience, like any aspect of human history, is richly diverse and complex.\nAs members of an academic community that prides itself on intellectual rigor and openness, it is our responsibility to explore a broad spectrum of perspectives, especially those that provoke debate and reflection. Let us take this Black History Month as an opportunity to broaden our horizons, engage with ideas that challenge us, and appreciate the rich tapestry of narratives that comprise Black history in America.\n\t\t\t\tRAHEEM WILLIAMS is an Executive MPA student at the Fels Institute of Government and a member of the Committee on Open Expression.

          "title": "Francesco Salamone | Is Penn about liberal arts or elite jobs?",
          "article_content": "\u201cWelcome to Penn! You are the most diverse class we ever admitted!\u201d The convocation rhetoric makes you feel so special. Penn is diverse because a student comes from Wisconsin and another from Kazakhstan. One plays the flute, one plays squash. Never mind that all of them want to be bankers or consultants. I wish someone had told me that nearly every other person sitting at Convocation with me would end up in the funnel. That however diverse my first-year class was, my senior class would simply not be.\nAs a teaching assistant for Wharton\u2019s required \u201cBusiness and You\u201d leadership course, I mentor first years adjusting to college and exploring careers. Someone confessed, \u201cIf not banking, then what else could I possibly do?\u201d If the best business school in the world (U.S. News debates aside) makes you believe you only have one option from day one, the institution, culture, and entire system have fundamentally failed.\n\t\tOf course, there is nothing wrong with those jobs: The last thing we need is a trembling economic system and inefficient markets. The problem is blindly assuming that one in two employed Penn grads and 80% of Wharton grads woke up and consciously made such a decision. Unpacking our culture proves how little of a decision this is and how everything revolves around two words: prestige and control.\nIt is common knowledge by now that Penn students are privileged. However, you may not know that for every single student from the bottom 20%, over 21 people come from the top 20%, blithely offsetting their upbringing. The result? An abject elite detached from reality. Okay, perhaps this is cynical, but if we are known for our elitist \u201cseeing and being seen\u201d culture, is it a surprise that 25% of us are so disillusioned to think the average U.S. salary is above six figures? Of course not (both not surprising and not true).\n\t\t\t\tPenn\u2019s alarming lack of socioeconomic diversity (despite efforts acknowledged this) unequivocally creates a culture perpetuating the value of money at the expense of everything else. The people you sit next to in class distract you with their laptop screens: purchasing a Gucci bag or booking Airbnbs in Cancun. The emails you receive are about banking and consulting events. This is the model. The only one. The only one, right?\nLet\u2019s be honest, \u201cjust follow your passion\u201d won\u2019t pay the bills, and I cannot blame an indebted or underprivileged student for desiring financial freedom with a high-paying job. This is why I am not saying the Wall Street lifestyle is unethical, although like others, I could. I am saying this is only one way to live your life. One of infinitely many. Which one makes sense for YOU?\n\tEveryone at Penn is good at planning, several are good at doing, and almost none are good at reflecting. The purpose of your college education is not exclusively career preparation. If this is what they had you do, I hate to tell you that you have been robbed. As writer William Deresiewicz argues, \u201cWhat you should want to develop in college is the habit of reflection, which means the capacity for change because most of what you come across in college will inevitably fade from memory. What is left over, precisely, is you.\u201d A culture, even more so an institution, should give you the tools to understand what model of life you want to live, not impose the model on you.\nYet, my student's question is central and inevitable: What else if not banking?\nAsking yourself what truly energizes you is no easy task, because it requires the vulnerability to let go of the comforting lifetime certainty that the predetermined path gives you: 2025 summer recruiting, analyst, associate \u2026 Well, the desire to eliminate uncertainty eliminates life. What do you plan to do after \u201csome years of experience\u201d with your future free time and why on earth are you not doing it now?\nIn his book \u201cExcellent Sheep,\u201d Deresiewicz advocates for the importance of time off, slowing down, breaking the cycle of endless achievement, and acknowledging the existence of a world outside of your Ivy League. It may be scandalous to some and unmistakable to others, but what if you replaced your obsessive passion for finance with one that is harmonious, perhaps exploring capacities you have not had a chance to cultivate? What if you did something you purposefully cannot put on a resume or post on LinkedIn? Yes, you may be \u201cbehind\u201d those who doubtlessly persist in the hierarchy, but what is the purpose of being at the top if you are climbing the wrong mountain?\n\t\tGet our newsletter, DP Daybreak, delivered to your inbox every weekday morning.The main idea behind the Pathless Path is not to neglect the ambition that got us where we are (not even to stop using Path@Penn), but rather to remember that Penn is not a four-year treadmill to (and playground for) the American elite. Yes, it was founded for them, but Penn\u2019s core mission today is the pursuit, enhancement, and dissemination of knowledge. We need to be aware of and manage our bewitching instinct to desire control and the social need for status. The truth is you cannot eradicate control and prestige. Just stop watering them. Like the French say, \u201cl\u00e2cher prise.\u201d\nLiberal education puts everything at risk and requires you to risk everything. The process is by no means comfortable, but it is liberating and extraordinary. If it happens right, it feels like giving birth to yourself. Or at least this is how I feel and the only obsession I have is ensuring everyone gets not the opportunity, but rather the choice of feeling this way, too.\nFRANCESCO SALAMONE is a Wharton sophomore from Palermo, Italy.

          "title": "Sose Hovannisian | A love letter to Philadelphia",
          "article_content": "Upon my acceptance to Penn a couple of years back, I was overwhelmed by an abundance of snooty comments and remarks relating to the city of Philadelphia, sentiments I could not visualize or understand. \u201cHave fun in Filthadelphia!\u201d or \u201cDon\u2019t get shot!\u201d often followed the congrats I received from most people. Not having had a proper vision of Philadelphia\u2019s layout or culture, I soon fell victim to my peers' alarming warnings and became rather cautious and overly attentive in my first weeks as a Quaker. Of course, the University alerts about various armed robberies or the occasional escaped prisoner did not help this berated city\u2019s case.\nWhile Philadelphia does have its safety hazards and concerning instances, I\u2019ve learned that just may be the price of living in a big city \u2014 the sixth biggest in the nation, in fact. Not to fluff up the real and present dangers, but it also should be said that Philadelphia is not much more dangerous than living in San Francisco, Chicago, or Miami, all of which are regarded as highly attractive places to live.\u00a0\n\t\tMany Penn students, coming from places of privilege and very comfortable livelihoods, are quick to harp on and nitpick at Philadelphia\u2019s imperfections. Jokes are constantly made about living in Philadelphia, comparing it to a punishment or drag. Most students are eager to move out, with their eyes set on New York City or Washington D.C., completely blind to the bevy of opportunities offered right here in Philadelphia. What many Penn students seem to overlook is the fact that Philadelphia is an esteemed, bustling, and charming city that many people dream of moving to and working in. Sure, Philadelphia is no tropical paradise, but it serves its purpose as a solid, spiffing city with so much to offer.\u00a0\nSo, instead of joining my peers in badgering on the City of Brotherly Love, I\u2019d like to take this time to highlight the best parts about living in Philadelphia, and hopefully convince you that we are extremely lucky to be going to school in such a vibrant and lively city.\u00a0\n\t\t\t\tSEE MORE FROM SOSE HOVANNISIAN:Penn students deserve more time off from their corporate-style academic calendarsThe pedagogic power of InstagramThe first thing that comes to mind when family or friends ask what I love about Philadelphia is, more often than not, the incredible food scene. Almost every restaurant, cafe, and quick lunch spot I have tried has wowed me, and I\u2019d like to say that that\u2019s a lot coming from a Los Angeles native! Just last year, Philadelphia won four titles in the James Beard Awards, whose prestige can be compared to \u201cthe Oscars, but for food.\u201d Beyond the bevy of choices we have near campus in University City, there are countless hidden gems and highly acclaimed restaurants in Rittenhouse, Fishtown, Northern Liberties, Manayunk, and more. Philadelphia is known for its diversity, and its countless cuisines are here to prove it. \u00a0\nPhiladelphia\u2019s finest cheesesteaks and soft pretzels are great, and they\u2019re best when eaten in the stands of one of the city\u2019s stadiums. Philadelphians beam with pride every time the Phillies, Eagles, Flyers, and 76ers play. Living in a city with this much athletic pride is not only great for our college experience, but it\u2019s also just a good time. Being able to go to these games, engage in the city\u2019s love for the teams, and enjoy city-wide celebrations is something we\u2019re very lucky to have at Penn, where school-wide athletic spirit is low.\u00a0\n\tEven if you\u2019re not one to appreciate sports, you can easily be one to appreciate Philadelphia\u2019s teams in a different way, perhaps by admiring one of the big Phillies murals on the Walnut Street walk to Center City. Philadelphia\u2019s streets are decorated with many murals and public art, coloring the city and demonstrating civic engagement through the expressions of many local artists. What\u2019s more, Philadelphia also offers many outlets to enjoy fine arts, whether it's through a day spent at the Philadelphia Museum of Art or a night at one of its many popular jazz clubs. Last year, Philadelphia was named the Public Art Capital of America, and the Best City in America for Street Art. And to top these accolades, Philadelphia is constantly celebrated for its memorialized history.\nNamed the Nation's First World Heritage City, Philadelphia is also known as the birthplace of the United States. In a city with a history so rich, every building, street, and alleyway has a story worth telling. Independence Hall, Benjamin Franklin, and the Liberty Bell all make this city the perfect historical backdrop for college students, offering countless opportunities to engage with the legacy of this country\u2019s founding fathers and their work. In particular, Philadelphia\u2019s long history of Black trials and tribulations is a key feature of the city\u2019s development. What\u2019s more, Philadelphia has grown into an unbelievably diverse city, boasting a great range of racial, socioeconomic, cultural, sexual, and religious representation. \u00a0\nWhile I have only touched upon some of the things that make Philadelphia so great, every Penn student has the opportunity to explore this big city and discover its many wonders for themselves. Penn\u2019s location, being right across the bridge from Center City, gives all able students the opportunity to just take a brisk walk out of the Penn Bubble and enter a realm of possibilities, opportunities, and new experiences. And for those of you who would rather not get on your feet, the city can just as easily be explored with the comprehensive and convenient SEPTA system.\u00a0\nI call on each and every one of you to take a moment the next time you\u2019re about to bash Philadelphia and consider the validity of what you\u2019re about to say, while also acknowledging our privilege of being here. Learn to love this city, for we know it loves you!\nSOSE HOVANNISIAN is a College sophomore majoring in communications and minoring in history and consumer psychology from Los Angeles, Calif.

          "title": "Kaynath Chowdhury | I am pro-ChatGPT",
          "article_content": "I support the use of ChatGPT.\nA statement that, said aloud, would garner me sidelong stares despite the website\u2019s appearance in many lecture halls.\n\t\tThe use of ChatGPT has raised much debate among students and become a topic of considerable contention. Similarly, many professors hold polarizing views, as the use of generative AI has been harshly rejected in some classrooms while others have tentative policies supporting its usage. The limitation of emerging technology in educational spaces should raise alarm bells, as we are rejecting tools that could be invaluable for facilitating learning. \u00a0\nTo be clear, I am against academic dishonesty, and I haven\u2019t used ChatGPT in a duplicitous manner. However, saying that ChatGPT is synonymous with academic misconduct is a remarkably weighty statement. I do assent that some individuals could use ChatGPT in an academically dishonest way, such as employing it to write papers in their stead. But, a similar result could be accomplished via other online tools, like Google. Just recently, we have become privy to accusations of plagiarism by former Harvard President Claudine Gay, revealing how this is not solely a ChatGPT issue. Thus, our viewpoint of the perpetrator should be reframed, delegating the fault to the person, not the tool.\n\t\t\n\t\nWith the release of GPT-4, many professors and students alike need to reconsider its benefits. Professors already recommend YouTube for content help, so why not ChatGPT?\nChatGPT can be a remarkable asset that provides an advantage to disadvantaged students. Since many Penn students come into university with a deep background in their chosen field of study, which they gained from their access to prep schools or private tutors, the bridge between these two groups is substantial. ChatGPT provides a way to somewhat balance the playing field.\n\tFor one, GPT-4\u2019s added feature of uploading PDFs makes it ridiculously simple to ask questions about lecture content, at any time of the day, while tailoring it to your level of understanding, a skill that many professors and teaching assistants lack. As several professors are utterly immersed in their fields and many TAs have an intuitive grasp of the subject, they are often incapable of making complex topics digestible. Unfortunately, there have been many instances where I gave up on asking questions to avoid receiving a convoluted response.\u00a0\nWith ChatGPT, feedback is immediate, allowing students to reflect on areas of improvement in their work, and providing them with mechanisms to improve over time. Why go through the hassle of setting up TA office hours to ask a simple question when ChatGPT can do it instantaneously?\u00a0\nStudents outside of Penn who do not have access to an educational institution with tutoring facilities also stand to attain so much from receiving academic help from ChatGPT. This is due to its similarity to using online services like Khan Academy, though ChatGPT is much more personalized.\nProfessors who reject the idea of incorporating ChatGPT into classrooms have not considered thinking critically of its beneficial uses. Instead, they are content with adhering to traditional practices, foregoing innovation for comfort. On the other hand, students who are against the usage of AI hold themselves to a higher standard for not relying on outside sources \u2014 similar to many Penn students' views of receiving academic help through services like Weingarten tutoring or office hours. For many, receiving outside help is equated to a lack of intelligence. As with the many Penn students of privileged backgrounds, they do not require additional help and thus look down on disadvantaged students who do require these services.\u00a0\n\t\tGet our newsletter, DP Daybreak, delivered to your inbox every weekday morning.In the end, humans are meant to be adaptable and always have been. Rejecting technological advancements accomplishes nothing; rather, it is actively harmful to many students who lose out on such a beneficial tool.\nWith that said, we should all sit to reflect on the valuable uses of ChatGPT.\nKAYNATH CHOWDHURY is a College sophomore studying political science and computer science from Detroit, Mich.

          "title": "Francesco Salamone | Let\u2019s talk about dying!",
          "article_content": "\u201cWhat do your parents do?\u201d someone seriously asked me during Wharton orientation. Fighting my brain's battle between an unforced desire to share and an aversion to the anticipated awkward look, I recognized that I would face a long, interminable moment of apnea trying to explain to the world that I do not have two parents because my dad died. Grief exists, and at Penn, it isolates.\nTo be clear, I do not intend to be a prophet speaking universal truths because loss looks different for everyone, but I hope you will find truth in my words nonetheless. Death is a sensitive topic, not the least because it intertwines with cultural, religious, spiritual, and socioeconomic aspects of our identity. Yet grief is undeniably omnipresent, and Penn is no exception, meaning I am not the first one to write (or talk) about it, nor will I be the last, unfortunately.\n\t\tAlmost 40% of college students have lost a family member or close friend within the last two years. Considering there are 18.58 million college students, that makes us more than 7 million grievers. I guess we are not a minority, are we?\u00a0\nWharton senior Pranavi Karnati lost her father last December after a battle with glioblastoma. She bravely watched him suffer for more than a year and a half, but \u201cdespite the pain he felt, he always managed to make us smile.\u201d She experienced a slower, anticipatory death and described her grief as \u201cisolating.\u201d\n\t\t\t\tSEE MORE FROM FRANCESCO SALAMONE: \ufeffIs Penn about liberal arts or elite jobs?There is no definitively designated place to grieve at Penn. Yes, Student Health and Counseling helps (if you are lucky), but 61% of college counselors in the United States report feeling \u201csomewhat, little, or not comfortable at all\u201d with supporting students primarily on grief. Unlike peer institutions like Princeton that offer grief-focused support groups, Penn lacks such infrastructure. The only comparable program that existed was Actively Move Forward, but it has been inactive since 2019.\nWhat about Philadelphia-based groups? As Karnati shared, before you even get a chance to talk about grief, you may face an identity crisis. \u201cThere are groups for children and groups for adults. What am I? Where are college students supposed to sign up?\u201d\n\tThe result explains why grief feels isolating. Naturally, some prefer to process on their own, but sooner or later, we crave feeling less like an alien and more like we are not the only ones experiencing excruciating pain. And support groups are one easy way to find others who relate.\nOf course, this is only half the problem. Remember, I believe Penn is a detached elite. Having two parents is a privilege: emotionally but interestingly also economically, and substantially so. I cannot blame you for having a privilege you did not choose, but I can and will invite you to reflect on it.\u00a0\nAfter Karnati posted her terrible news, she received several supportive messages: \u201cLmk if you need anything\u201d stood out. She mentioned, \u201cMy loss is making me realize who my true friends really are.\u201d\u00a0\nCan Penn students only support one another through hasty texts with cheap acronyms?\nWe know your \u201cI\u2019m here if you need me\u201d is well-intentioned, but understand that it creates a dilemma by putting the onus of starting the conversation on us, inadvertently burdening the griever even more. The individualistically expeditious culture of Penn is inevitably in direct contrast to the prolonged nonlinear path that grievers experience. At best, Penn students are awkwardly unequipped to support a grieving friend and at worst, fundamentally incapable of slowing down to care and empathize. You can do better.\nLike what? Be present with your friend\u2019s pain, listen with the heart, respect disordered confusion, and discover the gifts of sacred silence over filling words. That is what grief counselor Dr. Alan Wolfelt calls companioning. I wish my friends knew about companionship to ask me about my dad. Ask me what he was like, what he liked to do, what his quirks were. God, just ask me what his name was. When you ask, you are not reminding me that he died (trust me, I know), you are letting me know that you acknowledge that he lived.\nThe truth is I cannot blame them. Part of the matter is institutional and part of it is cultural: Many of us are used to the high school familiarity of knowing at least some family members of our friends. For better or for worse, in college, you are nothing more to others than what you present. And unlike your Canada Goose, you cannot wear your invisible grief when you walk down Locust. What you can wear is a Penn Face and pretend no one died, even with your closest friends, because it is profoundly easier and more tempting than the unfathomable truth.\nSo please, I beg you, next time you come across a griever, think twice before ending the conversation out of discomfort or sending the \u201cI\u2019m here if you need me\u201d text. Think beyond and think deeper. Perhaps take the simplest approach: Sit down with them and see where they will bring you.\n\t\tGet our newsletter, DP Daybreak, delivered to your inbox every weekday morning.If we collectively accept death as a mainstream topic of social dialogue, grief will be easier to handle than to hide. Harvard professor and happiness expert Arthur Brooks says: \u201cGrief does not have to be a private misery and net harm to our lives. We can learn to comprehend it, manage it, and grow from it. And in understanding our own grief, we can help others heal and thrive as well.\u201d\nAfter seven years, I understand my grief, and it is my hope (and Karnati\u2019s recent hope) that these words will help somebody.\nFRANCESCO SALAMONE is a Wharton sophomore from Palermo, Italy.

          "title": "Zara Tena | You should take an ethics class at Penn",
          "article_content": "This semester, I somehow ended up with four out of my five classes being either directly or indirectly about ethics. As a political science major, I was really excited to take these classes, since whenever people talk about ethics nowadays, it mostly has to do with politics or international relations.\nAt a time when our reality changes so rapidly because of technology, and when we are faced with a number of global challenges, some people have forgotten about the importance of acting morally. Especially at a place like Penn, where everyone seems to be extremely worried about their future and their careers, people often disregard these values when they are caught up by the competitive environment. Because of this, one would think that ethics classes would be extremely beneficial for all, but do they actually contribute to making students more ethical individuals?\n\t\tAccording to my professors, they don\u2019t.\nIn all four ethics classes, my professors started the semester by telling us that ethics classes will not make most of us more ethical. I sat there, listening to all of them, and I just could not understand why they would say something like that. If I wasn\u2019t going to learn anything, what was the point of taking these classes?\n\t\t\t\tSEE MORE FROM ZARA TENA:The urgent need for younger voices in politics\ufeffIt\u2019s okay to be ordinaryThat\u2019s where I was wrong: I have been learning a lot. While perhaps the main goal of ethics classes is not to turn students into more ethical people, they definitely give us the tools we need to critically engage with ethical dilemmas. By taking these classes, I might not become a better person, but they have given me a space where I can explore, discuss, and reflect about where I stand on so many issues and what my beliefs about morality actually are.\nEthics is not a subject that can be forcefully taught through lectures and readings. There is no way that we can sit down for three hours every week and magically become more ethical just because we memorize theories and read long papers written by old white men. The goal of these classes is not to tell us what is \u2018right\u2019 or \u2018wrong,\u2019 \u00a0but to give us the skills to navigate the gray areas in ethical decision making.\n\tThese classes encourage self reflection and personal growth. Even when analyzing big case studies or exploring different theories, students are pushed to question their own values, beliefs, and biases. While this may not guarantee that we will completely transform our moral compasses, the self awareness that comes from these reflections creates a great foundation for understanding why we act the way we do and also invites us to try to understand others.\nThe fact that ethics classes begin with a warning \u2014 that you won\u2019t become more ethical by taking them \u2014 should not stop anyone from giving them a chance. The ability to think critically, understand different values and perspectives, and have the skills to self reflect are essential parts of any college education. They prepare students for the complicated moral dilemmas they might face in their personal and professional lives \u2014 especially when most people at Penn will end up with jobs that are notorious for their ethical scandals!\nZARA TENA is a College sophomore studying political science from Puebla, Mexico.

          "title": "Lala Mustafa | Breaking our social routine",
          "article_content": "How many times have you found yourself in a never-ending cycle of back-and-forth messages, trying to pin down a date for a long overdue catch up with a friend? Every get together begins to feel as if it requires intricate planning and strips away the simplicity of social connection. This routine becomes stifling, lacking spontaneity and authenticity; you\u2019re constrained to coordinating with the same faces in the same places.\u00a0\nThis is what I like to call scheduling fatigue.\u00a0\n\t\tAs a result of this phenomenon, gatherings among friends are beginning to resemble scheduled business meetings, meticulously arranged via tools like When2Meet or synchronized Google Calendars.\nWhile resorting to scheduling may seem like the only viable option to maintain a semblance of social connection, perhaps it's time to embrace the idea of venturing out solo: I\u2019m challenging you to go on an unplanned side quest all by yourself to a third place.\u00a0\n\t\t\t\tMORE FROM LALA MUSTAFA:A nation on defense: Dismantling misinformation against Azerbaijan in the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict\ufeff\ufeffAllow me to explain. Picture the first place as your home and the second as your place of education or work. Now, the third place emerges as a public sphere where individuals congregate, not out of any obligation like in the previously mentioned locations, but, for lack of a more precise term, to simply vibe. It could be the cozy corner of a cafe, a communal park, or even the neighborhood barbershop \u2014 anywhere that\u2019ll allow you to interact with people outside your usual circles.\u00a0\nYet, at many universities like Penn, the concept of a third place seems all but lost as our lives remain restricted to school grounds, causing even our first and second places to converge into one. While spots on campus \u2014 like Stommons, Pret, or the cultural centers in ARCH \u2014 can offer some respite, they often come with the latent pressure of being on the clock. Conversations here revolve around assignments, internships, and the intricacies of Penn culture. The chances of an unexpected encounter dwindle given that most people in attendance will be other Penn students. As we\u2019re cocooned in the Penn bubble, it comes as no surprise that many students spend their four years in Philadelphia without ever fully exploring it.\u00a0\n\tYet, this insulation comes at a cost that extends far beyond what we realize.\u00a0\nIt severs our connection not only from the outside world but also from ourselves. That is, within such limits, our individuality dwindles, reducing us to mere roles influenced by our peers. By excluding ourselves from a wider social sphere, we inhibit opportunities to engage with diverse perspectives, trap ourselves in a cycle of familiarity, and risk leading monotonous lives that pave the way to burnout.\nHowever, in our lives, both intimacy and affiliation with broader communities are essential. While intimacy often stems from our immediate circles, affiliation thrives in third places where spontaneous interactions occur. These spaces facilitate easy contact with new individuals on a regular basis, without the need for prior scheduling.

          "title": "Beatriz B\u00e1ez | No closed captioning available",
          "article_content": "Columnist Beatriz B\u00e1ez explains her experience with language fatigue at Penn.On my first day at Penn, I called my father in distress, telling him I needed to move back home and study there as I was going to die alone at this university. My father asked why, and I quickly responded, \u201cI haven\u2019t met anybody in three hours. I have no friends. It\u2019s over for me.\u201d\u00a0\nThat very same night, I went to a New Student Orientation event at Houston Hall. As I nervously paced the floor in my Crocs, I overheard some students speaking Spanish and immediately gravitated toward them. Confessing, \u201cI heard Spanish, and I feel saved,\u201d I ended up meeting three genuine individuals, all from various parts of Latin America. Having arrived in the United States, it felt comforting to hear voices that reminded me of home. This comfort is priceless in such a foreign environment.\n\t\tAll my life, I\u2019ve taken courses in Spanish, spoken Spanish at home, and been berated by my grandmother whenever I spoke too much English. Arriving at Penn, I didn\u2019t anticipate the struggle I would face taking classes taught in English, as I had been lucky enough to have been extensively taught English from a very young age.\nBut speaking in a second language most of the time, even as a fluent speaker, is incredibly draining. Meeting native Spanish speakers at Penn was truly a blessing. However, I have found that some people react adversely to me speaking my primary language. These are not continuous reactions of a high degree, but there have been enough small instances to mark me.\u00a0\n\t\t\t\tMORE ON THIS TOPIC:Students celebrate 40th annual Festival Latinx, honoring Latinx culture on campusLa Casa Latina celebrates 2023 Latinx Heritage Month at PennOn various occasions, I have had Latinx friends say, \u201cLet\u2019s speak English so X person doesn\u2019t feel excluded,\u201d or even resort to English for \u201cconvenience\u201d when we\u2019re alone. For the former, I understand the sentiment. I wouldn\u2019t want someone to be excluded from a conversation in such a way. However, when I\u2019m naturally speaking Spanish, having my speech interpreted as a personal offense is off-putting.\u00a0\nIn one instance, I met a student through a mutual friend on a night out. This friend and I speak fluent Spanish; the person I had just met did not. Throughout the night, I had various conversations with my new acquaintance \u2014 who I found quite amicable \u2014 and my friend. I would naturally speak Spanish with the latter, not thinking much of it. The next morning, my friend told me how the new acquaintance felt I hated them for speaking Spanish in front of them, knowing they didn\u2019t speak the language.\u00a0\n\tI was shocked by the assumption and, in all honesty, a little offended. I found it quite conceited that one would think another person is speaking in their first language to actively exclude them. Speaking in a first language, for me, is purely a relief issue. Although I am fluent in English, after an entire week of speaking it, it can be extremely draining; thus, particularly in a social setting, I don\u2019t want to add to the exhaustion.\u00a0\nIt is more than fine to be curious about what somebody is saying and ask for a translation. However, immediately expressing discomfort upon hearing another language and presuming the other person is talking badly about you is inconsiderate toward them. More often than not, this language switch is for comfort. This was the first of sufficient instances that exposed a pattern in my time at Penn. In another class, I grew close to a few other Spanish-speaking students. One of them continuously suggested we switch back to English for seemingly no valid reason and would reply to any comment of mine in English.\u00a0\nThis harsh reality on campus expands into the club scene. In one instance, a native English speaker attended a club meeting primarily led in Spanish. Within this meeting, if club members asked questions in Spanish, any other members who answered quickly switched to English. Evidently, the intent is to have everybody be able to partake in conversation. However, members within a Spanish-led group should be able to detach from English formalities within club meetings, particularly if the club seeks to embrace Latinx heritage.\u00a0\nSpeaking in my primary language is the greatest manifestation of my culture, particularly since Spanish accents are so diverse throughout Latin America. Having to switch to English not only in academic settings but in seemingly every other sphere of Penn life further disconnects me from the culture I\u2019ve been surrounded by my entire life until now. This applies to any person whose main language isn\u2019t English, not only to Spanish speakers.\u00a0\n\t\tGet our newsletter, DP Daybreak, delivered to your inbox every weekday morning.Penn has students from over 100 countries, with around 19% of the student body being international. If one truly wants to immerse themselves in Penn\u2019s multilingual community, one needs to recognize that a language barrier works both ways. Just as an English speaker may be tired from learning another language, a non-English speaker can be drained from constantly speaking English. It\u2019s crucial to recognize that for the latter, multilingualism surpasses a simple language requirement and spills over to nearly every sector of their life at Penn.\u00a0\nLanguage fatigue is a true reality, especially for individuals who haven\u2019t learned English from a young age. Thus, if somebody within your social group is speaking their first language, which you are not fluent in, it does not give you the right to feel offended or urge them to speak in a tongue you understand. And, if you are a non-native English speaker, as much as you can, \"habla en tu primer idioma y que los dem\u00e1s se ubiquen.\"\nBEATRIZ B\u00c1EZ is a College first year studying mathematics and political science from San Juan, Puerto Rico.

And, if white is a moral choice, there is an enormous challenge: then you're challenging an entire civilization,\u201d said James Baldwin.\nWhiteness is the myth we\u2019ve been sold and under which we live. In our instruction at the University of Pennsylvania, we were told to reach for safety and to secure our decadence. So are the students now, but they are not nearly as certain that this is the road they\u2019d really like to walk. The students I knew have already paid that price for that ticket, and their horizons, on a human level, look bleak.\u00a0\n\t\tPhiladelphia is not a college town. It is a real city, a Black city, a poor city whose reality reflects the depth of the American crisis and yet contains the possibilities of its salvation. From the soil of this city rose heroes like Teddy Pendergrass, The Delfonics, McCoy Tyner, and Alfie Pollitt. A friend, then a nursing student who had packed her bags for New York City after graduation and returned a few years later to work in the hospitals, remarked on her return, \"Philadelphia has soul.\"\u00a0\nIn the five years since I\u2019ve graduated, the tone of campus has shifted. Students are developing a new language in order to deal with existential questions: What is the purpose of education and the responsibility of students in the wake of war? More than in my time, it is now clear that we, the students, want to be free. The crisis is deepening, and history is accelerating.\n\t\t\n\t\nFewer illusions are possible for the young mind in Philadelphia, which tempers and sharpens it like metal on metal. What the path to whiteness and an invented safety then produces is a delusional and unfree state. My peers, who are banking, coding, and consulting their lives away, are living as prisoners to the choices they\u2019ve made.\u00a0\nAll the beauty, genius, and potential I witnessed when we were young together, freshman year before the vicious teeth of Penn successfully \u201csocialized\u201d most of us, has been wasted, whittled down into dust, and lost. My old friends might have money, but they didn\u2019t manage to save their souls, and some part of them knows this fact \u2014 that they are perishing. We were never meant to become the fools and tools of the mythic America: the one that is superior, war-hungry, greedy, and hypocritical. These choices did their damage. That was an aberration. Now, we are entering a time of correction.\u00a0\n\tWe want to know the meaning of our lives when we live in a country whose hand assassinates a man and poet as beautiful and courageous as Refaat Alareer, when we live in a society in which Aaron Bushnell had to die so that humanity could live. When the youngest students of Philadelphia stand to say they are no different from the children of Palestine, that the bombs dropped abroad also explode in our neighborhoods, we then know it is true for ourselves \u2014 that we bleed the same as these children in Palestine, as all the men and women we encounter in Philadelphia.\u00a0\nOur bondage to the genocide in Gaza is through the struggle to become moral human beings in America, and to relinquish our country from the myths that strangle us and our people.\u00a0\nIt is unmistakable that the education Penn offers is bankrupt, and that some cancer, invisible but detectable, poisons our relationships to each other and to ourselves. The scramble for acceptance into mediocre clubs and fraternities is insufferable, and the false authority these groups stand on in order to make these judgments is embarrassing.

          "title": "Hanadi Abdulkadir | How poor dining hall food shapes our mental and academic capabilities",
          "article_content": "At this point, many Penn students have lived the terrible dining stories at a number of halls across campus. While it\u2019s important to discuss the health and sanitary risks associated with some of these concerns, it\u2019s also necessary to break down how this problem factors into students\u2019 academic and mental well-being.\u00a0\nOpening Sidechat every few days to see yet another picture of undercooked meat or hearing horror stories from my friends dissuades me from trekking across campus to eat at many of our dining halls. Oftentimes, I find myself skipping meals or stretching the time out between each one \u2014 until I accept the fact that I\u2019ll be eating the same food I already ate a couple times that week. Does this mean that I\u2019m probably missing out on some of the necessary vitamins or fiber I should be getting daily? Probably.\n\t\tNumerous Penn Dining Wellness emails live in our inboxes with tips on improving digestive health and practicing better healthy habits in our daily lives. Additionally, the official page for Penn Dining boasts awards and recognitions for sustainability and top college dining. However, the pristine and glossy promotional pictures of sandwiches, smoothies, and breakfast bowls tell a completely different story from the reality on campus.\nWith two of the most historical repeat offenders \u2014 Hill House and 1920 Commons \u2014 being the only consistent options available for on campus dining during the weekend, it\u2019s much more convenient to resort to the other retail spots scattered around campus. However, some of these locations are far apart, depending on where you live, and can add additional costs to weekly expenses. \u00a0\n\t\t\t\tSEE MORE FROM HANADI ABDULKADIR:\ufeffPenn should require an African American history courseWhy social media and Palestinian activism goes hand in handAdditionally, for students who are dishing out a hefty sum of money to enroll in the dining plan, going out of their way to seek expensive alternatives takes away money that could\u2019ve been better spent elsewhere. Considering that first years and sophomores are required to pick a dining plan for their first two years at Penn, it\u2019s no wonder that students have consistently called for the food standards to match the high prices of these meal swipes. Ideally, no student should feel like they need to resort to options outside of Penn; rather, outside options should be supplemental to an already quality level of options at all dining halls.\u00a0\nSince coming to Penn, my relationship with food has become much more complex. I need to look twice when picking out a seemingly clean utensil to eat whatever is on my plate or stare extra hard at my salad with suspicion before consuming it. But growing up, food was always a way for me to connect with my family and friends, to bring us back together even when we hadn\u2019t seen each other in a long time. Yet the food at Penn, at its worst, has left me frustrated and succeeded at suppressing my appetite \u2014 something I actually can relate to other students about.\n\tAlthough certain foods are scientifically linked to improving mental clarity and focus, I hesitate in reaching for those vegetables because they don\u2019t look as fresh or appetizing when lined up on display in Kings Court English House. As a result, I look for short-term solutions in coffee, which leaves me feeling tired earlier in the day or exhausted while trying to tackle my assignments at night. In order to meet my immediate deadlines, I prioritize some assignments over others, meaning some classes suffer in academic performance and perpetuate an almost never-ending cycle of playing catch-up. I believe that the root cause of all these problems can be traced back to the lack of decent dining.\u00a0\nThis same sentiment has been echoed by many of my friends and peers. But the dining quality at Penn can be mitigated if the University addresses the root problem. Whether that be promoting clean and sanitary workspaces when handling food or streamlining student complaints to Penn Dining other than through email, the University can restore student faith in the system. When it comes to campus dining, Penn can improve upon our experiences by implementing the changes that students deserve to enjoy, especially at the height of midterm season.\nHANADI ABDULKADIR is a College sophomore studying international relations from Philadelphia.

          "article_content": "During Penn\u2019s recent administrative upheaval, the University community found an unexpected silver lining: For the first time, Penn was making headlines alongside Harvard and MIT.\u00a0\nThe presidents of these three institutions were at the center of an infamous congressional hearing in December after their alleged missteps on campus antisemitism. I\u2019ll admit, there is something far more distasteful about chaos at the Capitol than the collective HYPSM prestige.\n\t\tBut many of us are taking our education at Penn for granted, shedding our \u201cque ser\u00e1, ser\u00e1\u201d optimism, and wondering at times what it would be like to go to a more recognizable Ivy. For decades, we\u2019ve all but exhausted our morale by clarifying to passersby that no, Penn State and Penn are not the same university. And yes, Penn is actually active in areas outside of Wharton\u2019s finance programs.\nSo, when Penn Engineering announced its new undergraduate program in artificial intelligence, many of us were enthusiastic about the University\u2019s growing role in the innovation sector: a space thought to be dominated by less business-oriented institutions.\n\t\t\t\tSEE MORE FROM MRITIKA SENTHIL: Removing legacy admissions will align Penn\u2019s actions more closely with its educational missionWhy changing leadership won\u2019t eliminate antisemitism at PennBut Penn\u2019s realization, of possibly its most practical initiative, begs the question: Is the University actually necessary in DevOps? Does sitting in a classroom \u2014 let alone one that\u2019s in the midst of a campus known for its influx of finance bros \u2014 really supersede what can be MacGyvered by a tech junkie with only a laptop, caffeine, and time? I want to give a definite \u201cno.\u201d Otherwise, I would need to hold my classmates and myself accountable for upholding all the exclusivity that comes with attending Penn. And yet, there are a frustrating number of anonymous netizens, D-list journalists, and LinkedIn bards who call Ivy League universities like Penn \u201cout of touch\u201d \u2014 remnants of centuries-old American elitism in an era of bottom-up grassroots movements.\nOne C-suite executive anticipates that \u201cthe best AI engineers and builders won\u2019t graduate Penn Engineering. They'll be global, builders and in the right group chats.\u201d His readers agree, with one commenter further emphasizing that \u201cuniversities cannot keep up with the pace of free market innovation.\u201d When these schools attempt to go against the grain and align with consumer needs, \u201cit genuinely looks embarrassing and out of date.\u201d\n\tIn an environment where the use of AI models is largely democratized, we\u2019re naturally drawn to the trope of a layperson who forgoes bureaucratic systems to channel their intelligence: creating life-changing inventions that would have never come to be under self-serving corporate and political influences. And when ignoring cases of succor \u2014 as mainstream media unfortunately does \u2014 there are many examples of such successes. Bill Gates and Paul Allen, co-founders of Microsoft, were university dropouts. So were Meta Platforms co-founders Mark Zuckerberg and Dustin Moskovitz. As Penn\u2019s over reliance on donors came to light earlier this school year, critics of the upper crust have continued to group Penn with other perpetrators of social stratification. The field of AI is, by nature, continuously evolving. And limiting growth in the discipline to those who can afford, and then succeed in Penn\u2019s Department of Computer and Information Science courses is counterproductive.\nHowever, these narratives misrepresent the intentions of Penn\u2019s AI program.\nTo make a better case for Penn\u2019s AI major, I spoke with Robert Ghrist, Andrea Mitchell Professor and associate dean for undergraduate education at Penn Engineering. He describes how the process of integrating AI in education is similar to the effects of increasing access to music recording and playback technologies. Now, there is \u201cmore music for everyone at much lower prices,\u201d he told me. Nonetheless, \u201cartists at the very top of the industry\u201d are increasingly the benefactors of \u201ca concentration of rewards.\u201d Taylor Swift is, as any current news feed can attest to, perhaps the most prolific embodiment of such phenomena. And professor Ghrist strives to make Penn an incubator of sorts for the \u201cTaylor Swifts of AI\u201d that seek avenues for academic growth, to actually be the \u201cleading edge where the best thrive.\u201d\nAnd to thrive in this discipline, aspiring AI mavens are off course by simply memorizing browser instructions in JavaScript and praying for a tech equivalent of the coveted Goldman Sachs internship. After all, studying AI is a philosophical pursuit: an inquiry into the nature of consciousness and ethics of creating sentient machines. It\u2019s also a political pursuit, for AI poses challenges in regulatory compliance. There are countless possible liabilities for even the most basic ChatGPT input, such as unprotected user data and violations of intellectual property rights. \u00a0\n\t\tGet our newsletter, DP Daybreak, delivered to your inbox every weekday morning.Needless to say, as you might have noticed in my earlier columns, I am not an AI major. I\u2019m not even enrolled in Penn Engineering. Am I, of all students, in the right to quash critics of the Penn AI major when I dropped AP Computer Science in high school (with no regrets)?\nYet, it\u2019s clearly irresponsible to follow the well-intentioned advice from tech capitalists when constant innovation is not particularly ideal for society. Maybe I\u2019m just afraid of a \"Black Mirror\"-esque dystopia, but there is a kind of ominous quality to the idea of highly skilled AI scientists off the reins. Penn, however, is cultivating an ecosystem that nurtures AI talent, albeit not by stifling the next Elon Musk or Sam Altman with red-tape-ridden academics; instead, Penn fosters ethically conscious innovation that addresses complex societal challenges. And so, the fact that I can engage with the Penn curricula across departments has a surprising beauty. The opportunity to become a part of this technological movement \u2014 or, dare I say, revolution \u2014 is the gift of studying AI at Penn.\nMRITIKA SENTHIL is a first year studying management and Russian and east European studies from Columbia, S.C.

          "article_content": "Artificial intelligence is a topic we can\u2019t seem to get enough of. From frequent announcements regarding policies within classrooms to endless professors and visiting scholars weighing in on the unprecedented effect large language models will have on our lives, I\u2019m sure we\u2019ve all discussed to death how revolutionary ChatGPT has become for college students.\u00a0\nMany of us have even had the chance to firmly establish positions on whether the University should embrace the technology wholeheartedly or put in place safeguards to prevent it from eroding the value of a college education, but up until now, the vast majority of conversations have been on a non-technical level.\n\t\tThat all potentially changed in this past month when Penn announced their first Bachelor of Science in Engineering in AI. Thankfully for us, Penn has chosen to launch this interdisciplinary degree at the \u201coptimal time\u201d to \u201ccreate a society where AI isn\u2019t just a tool, but a fundamental force for good to advance society.\u201d But at what cost? To what extent should we be using college as an opportunity to hyperfocus on not just a certain field (computer science), but a field within a field? Majoring in AI panders to the pre-professionalism Penn is known for and removes many of the foundational elements of the field that underlie innovation.\u00a0\nIn an interesting recent LinkedIn post, David Magerman pondered the implications of a university building complete undergraduate curriculums around a \u201cmodern business tool that is a niche application of computer science, diverting students away from a broad education in computer science.\u201d He went on to ask pointedly, \u201cWhat's next? A Bachelor of Arts in Blogging from the Annenberg School? A Wharton BS in Quantitative Trading?\u201d\n\t\t\t\tSEE MORE FROM AKIVA BERKOWITZ:The newsletter is dead\ufeffIsrael under attack: What do you stand for?As a current computer science major, I\u2019ll admit the AI curriculum looks fascinating. There is such an array of eye-catching electives (from Deep Generative Models to Natural Language Processing) that, if I were doing my degree all over again, I suspect I would have been swayed to switch into the major. But as a recently graduated computer and information science friend put it, the degree \u201cseems like the cool parts of CIS\u201d without the heavier basics like operating systems, computer systems, and physics \u2014 building blocks on the entire computer domain. \u00a0\nThe question I ask myself is whether artificial intelligence is really enough of an independent field that it transcends computer science and necessitates its own major. Is the relatively new field of AI established enough, broad enough, and unique enough such that the skills we gain through taking just those mostly career-focused courses today will undoubtedly remain relevant in 30 years and justify the $84,600 a year sticker price? I simply wonder how likely it may be that AI will become so unrecognizable in 20 or even 10 years, given its breakneck pace of innovation, that students may have wished that their majors in college focused on more fundamental elements of the field that innovators keep turning back to for insight.\u00a0\n\tAside from long-term career effectiveness an AI degree would have compared to computer science or electrical engineering, Penn is known for its pre-professional student body, and this new major shows signs of that sentiment leaking into the curriculum as well. In contrast to the Penn Integrates Knowledge professorships that bring in academic leaders who deeply understand multiple fields to better spark insight between them, this new major filters various courses of study to pluck out the elements we find valuable today.\u00a0\nIn this line of thinking, maybe we should consider the true value of a groundbreaking Wharton degree in quant trading that would promise to \u201csculpt the financial moguls of tomorrow\u201d with unparalleled prowess in algorithmic trading strategies and quantitative analysis.\u00a0\nAll this is to say, I immediately understand the value the current AI concentration within the larger CIS curriculum has. And I appreciate the Ph.D. programs that take students to a higher level of understanding, once they\u2019ve taken the time in their undergraduate training to build the broad foundations. I simply remain curious of the true value an AI undergraduate degree offers us as students over other forms of study within the field and the certain level of indulgence in pre-professionalism that it plays into on Penn\u2019s campus.

          "title": "Eric Najera | Penn must take action to enhance the dining experience",
          "article_content": "As busy college students, most of us do not have time to cook our own meals, and if you are anything like me, cooking is far from your forte. The hassle of having to go to the grocery store, cook, and clean can be time consuming and even more difficult when you\u2019re overwhelmed with classes, clubs, and homework. For the many students without access to a kitchen in their dorm, this presents an even bigger challenge. Luckily, college campuses have dining halls! Students simply swipe their card to get access to an all-you-care-to-eat dining experience. Dining halls provide easy access meals to students\u2014but what happens when that food is inedible?\nAs a picky eater, I know that simply because I do not like a dish does not mean it is unsafe to eat, but food with cockroaches and glass is unsafe for anyone. A seemingly obvious underlying assumption in dining is that food is safe to eat. College dining halls should be a place where students go to eat well-cooked, hairless, and insect-free food. However, that is not the case at Penn: There is a lack of responsibility to make sure the food is meeting basic standards for, let alone satisfying, all students.\u00a0\n\t\tMeal plans are far from cheap. For the sticker price, students would expect quality food, but they would be wrong. Both of the first-year student meal plan options cost $6,330, with the maximum amount of swipes being 296. Each meal swipe equates to roughly $17, which is about the same price as a Caniac Combo at Raising Cane's. As previously stated, Penn dining hall food is far from gourmet, and its price is too high for the quality delivered.\u00a0\nExpensive dining plan meals are not unique to Penn, but other Ivy League schools have similar prices for better quality food. Cornell University offers an unlimited meal plan, so students may visit the dining halls as much as they want with a fixed cost of $6,942 for food ranked second-best in the nation. So, for roughly 600 more dollars, Cornell students have access to unlimited meals and substantially better quality dining.\u00a0\n\t\t\t\tSEE MORE FROM ERIC NAJERA: \ufeffWe should be grateful to attend PennPenn clubs should have an assigned faculty member\ufeffAside from price and quality, weekend dining is another struggle. With the popular McClelland Sushi & Market and Houston Market being closed on Saturdays and the other dining halls closing at 8 p.m., food options are limited. Late-night study sessions means having to resort to local food places that remain open, and unlike nearby schools such as Drexel, our dining dollars do not work at off-campus restaurants and out-of-pocket money spent on takeout can add up quickly.\nBefore every school break, Sidechat is flooded with posts of excitement for home-cooked meals. In my classes, when asked what we are excited for, most students reply being able to eat good food. It is not uncommon for college students to miss their home-cooked meals, but when students are excited to actually eat food that is not served alongside insects, it signifies a problem.\n\tWith Penn\u2019s Bon App\u00e9tit contract still in place, we may not know how much Penn can do to change the dining experience. Safe, clean food should not be an unreasonable expectation.

          "title": "Zaid Alsubaiei | Does Penn\u2019s diversity represent its sense of community?",
          "article_content": "We all know the typical \u201ctypes\u201d of high schoolers, the different clich\u00e9s: Where are my nerds at? But, another attribute of student groups that has become increasingly relevant in the 21st century United States is the diverse ethnic makeup of its population. And, frankly, do we as a campus mirror all that comes with that national trend of diversity?\nThink of the friends with whom you often hang out. Then, ask those friends with whom they usually go out. Finally, think of the groups you are a part of, the extracurriculars in which you partake. Notice a pattern?\n\t\t\u201c[D]espite increased opportunity to live and work in mixed-race settings, Americans remain racially segregated in their friendship patterns,\u201d a study published by the National Institutes of Health found. \u201cSpatial racism, cultural encapsulation, and personal choice are contributing factors for patterns of same-race friendships.\u201d\u00a0\nThis pattern seems to reflect the divisions present in Penn\u2019s social scene as well. Despite coming from all sorts of backgrounds across the world, the University\u2019s students appear to have unconsciously adopted a policy of self segregation. In other words, we like to \u201cstick to our own\u201d by socializing with others to whom we relate to on a cultural, ethnic, or religious basis. So, regardless of Penn\u2019s efforts to integrate people of differing experiences and beliefs, there still remains a degree of resistance by individuals themselves to cross those racial or cultural lines.\n\t\t\n\t\nAs a result, the potential for diversity of thought is threatened. A narrow mindset develops within these groups that students pledge to, and they effectively act as echo chambers that exacerbate already crippling political polarization. We relate to each other less, rely on our \u201cown\u201d more, and become less tolerant of the views, and thus experiences, of those who do not necessarily look, think, or speak like us.\nThis kind of thinking \u2014 whether manifested in the form of race, religion, or otherwise \u2014 has led to serious tension at times and enabled a distorted view of certain communities and how they experience Penn. I attribute part of that thinking not to the identity groups we are a part of, but to how much we value them over who we are as individuals.\n\tHomogenous communities definitely have their place in the college experience: They help ease our transition when we first arrive at Penn, and their role cannot be replaced. I say this as an international student myself, who had a hard time acclimating to an entirely different culture and, most radically, diet. Nonetheless, we should treat these organizations as an aid to finding belonging on campus, not a substitute for individual thought and expression.\nHowever, none of this means individuals can\u2019t agree or always need to separate themselves from the group. The use of a large, collective voice can benefit our campus much more than we realize. What is important to note is that there lies a clear distinction between acknowledging the views of others and forcing ourselves to accept those views for the sake of conformity.\nThere is nothing wrong with disagreeing with the majority, whether it is one against two or one against a nation (though some may try to tell you otherwise). As long as you are respectful and driven by a desire to learn rather than defend, there are no limits on what perspective you may question. So, challenge your beliefs, reevaluate your viewpoint, challenge that of others (no matter who they are), and then reevaluate yourself again. It\u2019ll be hard at first, to express your precise, genuine thoughts without fear. But, remember that you\u2019re not alone (I struggle sometimes myself) and that it\u2019s a process you won\u2019t always get right.\n\t\tGet our newsletter, DP Daybreak, delivered to your inbox every weekday morning.The hardest part of breaking out of groupthink, after realizing it, is talking about it. My advice? Take the plunge and never look back. The next time you are in a group and the majority agrees with an idea you don\u2019t like, let it be known. Talk about it and explain why you think the way you do. Don\u2019t worry if some get offended or others simply do not agree; it is normal and, in fact, expected.\u00a0\nNever forget that disputes you engage in are an opportunity, not a challenge, and our differences are enlightening, not threatening. Only then will we begin to understand and appreciate each other more as unique actors in a truly historic community.\nZAID ALSUBAIEI is a College first year studying economics from Al-Khobar, Saudi Arabia.

          "title": "Eliza Carroll | You are what you read: Sidechat\u2019s impact on campus",
          "article_content": "I downloaded Sidechat this fall after my friends sent me too many screenshots of funny memes or jokes posted on the anonymous app. I figured that doing so would simply remove the middleman. I was already being exposed to the same jokes, memes, comments and judgements as those on the app anyway \u2026 right?\u00a0\nIn December, I returned home for reading days and fell into an easy pattern of studying. Nothing I did was wildly exciting or social, but I instead found myself enjoying the routine and satisfaction of productivity. During my study breaks, I would scroll on Sidechat \u2014 and from the comfort of my home, I felt myself spiraling into anxious dread about returning to Penn. Each time I opened the app, I was faced with a barrage of posts all echoing the same sentiment: Penn is awful and depressing. Without a second thought, I accepted those posts as fact, and in doing so, I allowed Sidechat to have more power than it deserves. In other words, I subscribed to the complaining culture that is pervasive on Sidechat.\u00a0\n\t\tUsing Sidechat, especially without intentional thought, is a way of looking at Penn through hypercritical glasses. Perhaps this is because negativity has been normalized and cynicism gets more upvotes. To some extent, this pessimistic messaging is diluted with the insertion of mildly entertaining memes or jokes, but the result is still the same. With each scroll, Sidechat is perpetuating a defeatist perspective of Penn.\u00a0\nSo, I arrived back at Penn to take my final exam: openly unhappy about returning to what I thought would be a bleak campus as a result of discourse on Sidechat. But to my surprise, it was not horrific, and I was able to enjoy my weekend of studying just as I had my week at home. The sheer volume of disheartening posts on Sidechat had clouded my perspective and ability to see the best in the situation. Sure, I was becoming one with a Huntsman GSR while others were at home enjoying break, but on the other hand, I was with my friends and able to have a sleepy campus all to myself.\n\t\t\t\tAs is the case with most other social media platforms, Sidechat is consumed passively and without a second thought \u2014 it\u2019s used to pass time, curb boredom, and satiate our addictions to our phones. And yet, students are absorbing and internalizing content more quickly than they can truly digest it.\u00a0\nGiven the bandwagon culture on Sidechat, users often build off of one another, creating a chaotic, and often dismal, echo chamber that does not truly represent life at Penn. Whether or not college is the best four years of your life, it is at least what you make of it, and Sidechat enables students to feel like victims of an unknown cause. For those who are actually struggling, Sidechat acts not as a productive outlet, but rather as a meta ether that provides no remedy other than the satisfaction that others are unhappy too.\u00a0\n\tSince winter break, I have in fact deleted Sidechat and am all the better for it. I still get sent the best and the brightest jokes by my friends, but I am no longer overwhelmed by unsolicited complaints on an hourly basis. Without Sidechat, my thoughts on the housing lottery, the floods in the Quad, and upcoming midterms are completely my own. Deleting Sidechat may not be for everyone, but it\u2019s imperative for those who chose to use Sidechat to take a more critical view of what is being circulated and evaluate whether or not they are benefiting from it. It may just change the way they see Penn.\u00a0\nELIZA CARROLL is a College first year studying international relations and art history from Greenwich, Conn.

          "title": "Cathy Li and Liala Sofi | History can\u2019t repeat itself; stand with Chinatown",
          "article_content": "Students for the Preservation of Chinatown protested outside the Board of Trustees meeting held at the Inn at Penn on Mar. 3, 2023. \nA few weeks ago, the streets of Chinatown came to life with firecrackers and lion dances ringing in the year of the dragon. As you walk through the brightly colored 40-foot paifang \u2014 known to most as Chinatown\u2019s Friendship Gate \u2014 you enter into a cultural oasis that has stood strong in the heart of Philadelphia for nearly 150 years. Beyond this fixture, Chinatown serves as a home to nearly 3,000 residents and numerous family-owned businesses, restaurants, shops, and community organizations. Whether you are going to Ken\u2019s Seafood Restaurant for a fun night out or Heng Fa for groceries, Chinatown feels like home.\u00a0\nUnfortunately, this community has been under constant attack for decades and is once again facing the threat of displacement and gentrification from a plan to develop an arena for the Philadelphia 76ers merely a block away. We firmly stand with the Students for the Preservation of Chinatown and urge you to do the same. \u00a0\n\t\tSince the early 1900s, Chinatown has been a victim of gentrification often driven by predatory infrastructure projects. In 1932, the construction of subway infrastructure at Ridge and Eighth streets \u2014 and the subsequent development of the Vine Street Expressway from 1957 to 1991 \u2014 resulted in the destruction of buildings and severe divisions within the community. Bringing in noise and pollution, the expressway eroded neighborhoods and people's quality of life. This was not Chinatown's sole battle, however, as it also faced multiple proposals of developments for a federal prison in 1992, a baseball stadium in 2000, and a casino in 2008.\u00a0\nThe story of Philadelphia's Chinatown mirrors other Chinatowns across the nation. Amid the 1994 fiscal crisis in Washington, D.C., then-Washington Wizards owner Abe Pollin negotiated a deal for the downtown Capital One Arena, where the city covered pre-development costs to acquire and demolish properties. Entrepreneurs in Washington's Chinatown voiced concerns about prices of real estate skyrocketing and parking impacts on businesses in the area. A decade later, most Chinese residents were forced to move out due to unaffordable housing. The parking shortage led to the closure of the last Chinese grocery store, accelerating the decline of the Chinese American population in the area to fewer than 400 residents today. Ironically, as D.C.\u2019s arena now relocates to the suburbs, the community is left behind, having endured irreversible destruction while in the midst of its recovery from the pandemic.\u00a0\n\t\t\t\tMORE FROM LIALA SOFI AND CATHY LI:Liala Sofi | The hypocrisy of billionaire philanthropistsCathy Li | Philadelphia\u2019s changing tastesIn New York\u2019s Chinatown, threats of displacement and economic insecurity also loom high. In 2021, the Museum of Chinese in America accepted a donation of $35 million in support of a borough-based jail complex which would displace Chinese American working-class people in the area. On top of that, its board executives were connected to the closing of the last unionized restaurant, beloved Jing Fong banquet hall, and construction of luxury towers that are actively raising rent and real estate taxes in the area.\nIn Philadelphia, the current 76Place project is being developed by 76 DevCo, an initiative by 76ers managing partners Josh Harris, David Blitzer, and David Adelman. Adelman is at the forefront of the construction of the arena and has promised not to displace the residents or businesses in Chinatown, but his past actions speak louder than his current words. Adelman works closely with Brett Altman, who also owns the University City Townhomes, and was a key figure behind the demolition and end of affordable housing in the West Philadelphia area that was previously known as the \"Black Bottom.\u201d This constant cycle of displacing residents and communities that have lived in the area for generations must end, and we must be the voice to make this happen.\n\tDevelopers of the project have stated that the arena will \u201cserve as a model for an equitable & inclusive community,\u201d yet there is not a single mention of Chinatown in the proposal. Efforts to ensure communities can benefit from this project read as empty promises when nearly 95% of residents, business owners, and visitors oppose the arena\u2019s construction.\nMany questions posed by residents have also gone unanswered by 76 DevCo. How will restaurants and small businesses in the surrounding area be protected? Who will clean the streets after huge events?\u00a0\nPreserving Philadelphia's architectural heritage demands careful consideration in urban development, but the development of the arena does the exact opposite \u2014 jeopardizing accessible low-income and senior housing complexes, healthcare clinics, and schools for children.\nPenn has direct ties to the developers in the area, and students should be cognizant of the situation. Adelman currently sits on Penn Medicine Board of Trustees and is the CEO of Campus Apartments, which houses many Penn students off-campus. But more importantly, Penn students are directly and indirectly involved in the Chinatown community, whether that be Penn Lions performing all throughout the city for Lunar New Year, or student groups like SPOC organizing initiatives to honor traditions celebrating the multi-ethnic communities that reside there.\u00a0\nDespite what greedy developers may suggest, Chinatown is not an ethnic theme park but a home. It\u2019s more than just a place to eat, it\u2019s a support network and a cultural hub for immigrants and visitors alike.\nIn the face of ongoing threats, Chinatown has demonstrated remarkable resilience and activism, advocating for the needs of all diverse communities of color that are integrated into the cultural fabric of our city. The next time you are in Chinatown, take a look around at all the place has to offer. Venture into Ebisu for some home decor and enjoy a Mochinut donut as you shop. Come by Dae Bak for soul-nourishing Korean barbecue. The opportunities to support your favorite restaurants and local businesses are endless.\nPlease don't turn a blind eye to what is happening outside the Penn bubble. Pay attention to what SPOC and other organizers are doing in the fight for the preservation of Chinatown. Educate yourself on what is going on in Chinatowns across the country. If you can, participate in programming like Crane Chinatown Community Center art exhibitions or Show Your Love for Chinatown events to learn more about the challenges facing the neighborhood. Sign petitions. \u00a0\nAdorned with dragon motifs, and gorgeous ornamental roof tiles, the Friendship Archway is not only an architectural masterpiece, but a labor of love \u2014\u00a0created for community by community. The engineers and artisans from Tianjin, China \u2014 Philadelphia\u2019s sister city \u2014 came together with residents and the city of Philadelphia to fund and invest in Chinatown, and you should too.\u00a0\nThe next time you walk through the gate, remember that the fight for Philadelphia\u2019s Chinatown, and Chinatowns everywhere, is not over.

          "title": "Caroline Magdolen | \u201cEveryone cheats.\u201d What can we do about it?",
          "article_content": "My guess is that nearly everyone reading this article knows someone who has been academically disingenuous, or been that someone before. Being academically dishonest isn\u2019t all about flashy examples, like the two admitted Penn students accused of plagiarism and fabricating data in 2022. There are smaller violations that may feel less egregious, or even harmless, like querying ChatGPT for help completing your homework, peeking at a friend\u2019s lab assignment, or answering a PollEverywhere as if you\u2019re in class, when really, you\u2019re snoozing in your dorm.\nAcademic dishonesty is having a moment in the spotlight. The advent of generative AI, the use of which cannot be reliably detected by grading softwares, will likely upend student learning for better or worse. At the same time, examples of plagiarism by prominent academics are being dug up left and right. The former president of Harvard, Claudine Gay, was ousted in part due to plagiarism concerns, and Business Insider found that former MIT professor Neri Oxman (the wife of billionaire Bill Ackman, who led the campaign against Gay) \u201cstole sentences and whole paragraphs from Wikipedia, other scholars and technical documents in her academic writing.\u201d\n\t\tTo be clear, I believe that academic dishonesty at Penn \u2014 going against community standards that your professor has explicitly outlined \u2014 is unacceptable, and that we should be doing more to penalize and prevent it.\nNevertheless, we must also acknowledge that academic dishonesty is understandable, in that we can piece together students\u2019 rationales when they do cheat, and even sympathize with them in some cases.\n\t\t\t\tSEE MORE FROM CAROLINE MAGDOLEN:\ufeffThe Rat Kings of PennThere\u2019s no better time for climate education\ufeffTo dissuade academic dishonesty, we employ sayings like, \u201cIt will only hurt you in the long run to cheat,\u201d or \u201cYou\u2019re taking advantage of other students who've completed their work fairly.\u201d This is true in some circumstances. If you\u2019re an aspiring quant and you\u2019re asking ChatGPT to calculate all of the derivatives on your MATH 1400 homework, it\u2019s going to show: First in your exams for the class, then in every math class you take thereafter, and especially in your future career. And if MATH 1400 is curved, your dishonest success capitalizes on the honest failures of others \u2014 not cool.\nBut this is not true in all cases. Jane* was a first year in her spring term when she was taking CIS 1210: Data Structures and Algorithms \u2014 a famously challenging CIS course \u2014 with Rajiv Gandhi, a famously challenging professor.\u00a0\n\tShe cheated on her coding assignment late into the semester, and as per the professor\u2019s policy, received a -300/100 on the submitted homework and zeros on all previously submitted homework, receiving a D as her final grade in the course.\nBut Jane believes that what is more important to her story is not what happened, but why it happened.\u00a0\n\u201cWhat drove me to make a bad decision? Why are [these classes] so infamous? It\u2019s because of notorious policies where you cannot collaborate on many assignments. You are given long problem sets to do, on your own, each week, with desperate students in office hour queues that are two to four hours long. Many times, you will go to the TA and not get a clear answer. It is a profoundly isolating situation, particularly for freshmen just entering college, and that\u2019s what drives well-meaning people to cheat.\u201d\nBased on my conversation with Jane, it seemed that she felt isolated at the time and was struggling to reach out for the support that she needed, both in CIS 1210 and at Penn as a whole. And given the limited support Jane could receive from TAs and her instructor, backtracking her friend\u2019s code felt more conducive to her learning than doing nothing.\nJane expressed a lot of remorse over what happened, and said that she still has a lot of respect for Rajiv, maintaining a good relationship with him to this day. She was also grateful that Rajiv was willing to handle this internally, since a low grade in the class looks better than a formal statement on her transcript, detailing her violation of academic integrity.\n\u201cI deserved to be punished harshly,\u201d Jane said. \u201cBut the collaboration policies of these introductory courses, and the punishment I received, wrecked my self-esteem and my early college experience. I felt that there was no way out.\u201d\nAccording to Jane, Rajiv's philosophy is to \"let go of your grades early: the sooner you stop caring about your GPA and start caring about learning, the better.\" She agrees with this philosophy, especially since he curves his courses generously, but sees this as out of touch with the realities of many Penn students.\nAfter students have prioritized perfecting their grades and resumes (and have been praised for it) in high school, those habits won\u2019t get undone overnight. Even at Penn, there are many institutions and accolades that continue to reward \u201cperfect\u201d performance over pursuing difficult academic disciplines, experimenting, and invariably messing up sometimes.\nFrankly, for a pre-med student in computer science (a track which Jane was considering at the time), the adage that \u201ccheating will hurt you in the long run\u201d skill-wise doesn\u2019t hold much water. The skillset of a future doctor and a software engineer just don\u2019t overlap enough. What can hurt a pre-med in the long run is a low GPA.\nAnd while there are some students for whom projects, internships, and technical interviews will get them a lot further in guaranteeing their success, this is not true for everyone. For many preprofessional students who may want to challenge themselves with a major or minor in CIS, they risk getting shut out of the study altogether.\nWhat frustrates me most about this entire situation is not that such harsh action was taken, but that it appears ineffective in tackling the issue at hand. If a student wanted to cheat, they could just take CIS 1600 or CIS 1210 during a different semester, when a different instructor was in charge and penalties were anecdotally known for being less harsh.\nWhile Jane\u2019s actions were clearly wrong, I can\u2019t help thinking that she was just the unlucky example that had to face the music, and she said as much in our interview: \u201cEveryone cheats in this class. You don\u2019t survive [CIS 1600 or CIS 1210] without talking to people, it just depends on whether you get caught. That doesn\u2019t make cheating okay, but it does mean that we need to rethink how these courses operate.\u201d\nSo, what can we do so that not everyone cheats?\nThis is a complex question, and there is no easy answer. It is crucial that as we frame the issue of academic integrity violations, we look at both the violations themselves and the root motivations that drive them \u2014 these actions are not taking place in a vacuum.\u00a0\nAcademic integrity violations these days are, to an extent, simply easier to commit. ChatGPT has led to a surge in \u201cunfair advantage\u201d violations. And even before generative AI, the pandemic had uprooted our usual test-taking environment. Now that classes are in person again, we no longer need to have take-home or open-Internet exams, but these still persist in some classes, and are easier to cheat on. Penn, given its history of fraudulent alumni, isn\u2019t going to be a place where professors can blindly trust students to refrain from cheating when presented with the option, so professors should take some responsibility for leveling the playing field in the classroom too.\u00a0\nJulie Nettleton, the executive director of Penn\u2019s Center for Community Standards and Accountability (CSA), relayed over email that CSA already works closely with schools and centralized resources at Penn to discuss how to proctor exams, and with faculty to discuss exams, syllabi language, and classroom policies.\nWhat constitutes a violation itself is currently not standard across classes, or even across different sections of the same class. How to handle a concern of academic integrity falls to the professor first \u2014 this is how Jane completed CIS 1210 with a lower grade, rather than a formal sanction from the CSA. It makes sense to delegate this responsibility to professors: It is more efficient than having the CSA handle every case, and professors should have the freedom to decide what constitutes cheating in their classrooms.\nHowever, this does open the door to students deliberately choosing sections of a course with professors that have more relaxed academic integrity policies. Conversely, some professors can be overly harsh, to the point where they are acting unfairly towards their students.\u00a0\nJill*, another student that I interviewed for this article, was falsely accused by her professor of collaborating on her final exam with her peers. At the start of winter break, the professor sent a class-wide email imploring those who worked together on the take-home exam to turn themselves in or have the matter escalated. Jill recalls that for students that turned themselves in, the professor lowered their grades accordingly \u2014 everyone else was reported to the CSA.\nIn the end, Jill\u2019s name was cleared, but she was assigned a case manager that seemed to have assumed she was guilty by default. As the case progressed, many of the details that the professor used to build the case against her appeared superfluous \u2014 for example, she and her friends had all rounded to the same decimal place in their work. Jill suspects that the escalation may have been personal: she had previously asked the professor, on behalf of the class, if he could make changes to his teaching style to facilitate learning.\nIt seems wrong to me that a professor could accuse a student and cause such extensive stress when in the end, Jill turned out to be innocent. It reminded me of some other methods that professors use to catch students cheating, such as Turnitin\u2019s flawed AI detector.\nPart of the solution to rampant academic dishonesty may also lie in expanding our vocabulary to discuss the issue, as John McWhorter pointed out in The New York Times. A class-wide cheating ring, direct plagiarism of original ideas from a paper as one\u2019s own, and copying a line of someone\u2019s code all constitute academic dishonesty, but range broadly in terms of severity and \u201cease of catching.\u201d However, this is rarely reflected in academic integrity policies.\u00a0\nIt can be awkward to suggest that some forms of dishonesty are worse than others, and more awkward still to draw the line between different punishments for different violations, but we must still have these conversations.\u00a0\nWhat should constitute dishonesty at all? When speaking with Jane, she would often circle back to how isolating it was to work alone on her assignments as a first year in introductory computer science courses, particularly as a woman in STEM. Every day, she would walk out of class \u201cfeeling way worse about [her]self.\u201d Now exploring chemistry, physics, and biology courses, she greatly appreciates the change in her academic environment, where students are encouraged to openly collaborate. The grade medians in chemistry are similar to those in CIS (which is to say, not great), but Jane is not as stressed as she was in CIS 1210, since she studies with her friends, and they can struggle and ask for help together.\u00a0\nWhile it was dishonest of Jane to copy code when it was against CIS 1210 policy, perhaps CIS majors and minors would learn more from the course if they were in a more collaborative environment to begin with. Jane has suggested that CIS 1210 should find a middle ground where students can learn from each other, but not be overly reliant on collaboration to perform well on exams.\u00a0\nShe also argues that there should be more opportunities for students to admit to academic dishonesty \u2014 through a friend at Stanford, she heard that at the end of a computer science class, students can select the assignments they have cheated on and receive a negative score on them, or risk facing more uncertain penalties if they are later caught.\u00a0\n\u201cThis policy gives people a second chance to do the right thing, and I do believe that you learn from an experience if you own up to it,\u201d Jane said.\nDeliberations over how best to address academic dishonesty can go on without end, but unfortunately this column must do just that. So here, I want to leave you with a reminder of what I said at the beginning: Academic dishonesty is unacceptable, but it is also understandable.\n\t\tGet our newsletter, DP Daybreak, delivered to your inbox every weekday morning.The hard, but necessary, solution to \u201ceveryone cheating\u201d is taking a good look at the stories behind academic dishonesty, and listening to the students involved with sympathy.

          "title": "Jack Lakis | What we can learn from Penn\u2019s college ranking",
          "article_content": "Last fall, a plethora of new results from U.S. News & World Report, Wall Street Journal, and Forbes elevated Penn in their national college rankings. Nearly every list places Penn among the top 10, some going as far as placing the University among the top five. This universal growth resulted from a key change in most of these sources\u2019 metrics: greater consideration given to postgraduate salaries.\nPenn famously has one of the highest-earning alumni bodies in the country. Starting salaries for Penn graduates are often considered the highest in the Ivy League. By mid-career, the average Penn alum is raking in $165,000 annually, while the national average for a college graduate caps out at $74,000.\n\t\tPenn draws a great deal of prestige from its potential to produce high earners, which is a direct result of our school\u2019s preprofessional culture. Nearly 50% of all Penn graduates enter one of two career fields: consulting or finance. This pipeline allows most Penn alumni to matriculate into high-paying jobs shortly after graduation.\nI\u2019m usually a defender of preprofessionalism. It\u2019s crucial that Penn graduates are able to find good jobs, and high salary potential is an immense advantage. But those jobs aren\u2019t everything. Many universities are making gains in rankings and name recognition based on alumni outcomes in public service careers.\n\t\t\t\t\ufeffSEE MORE FROM JACK LAKIS:\ufeffDo we all hate Penn?Staying focused after Magill's resignation\ufeffFor example, Harvard University boasts about its eight presidential alumni. However, when 1968 Wharton graduate Donald Trump was elected president, Penn mostly ignored his history with the school. Given his proximity to controversy and his unconventional political history, Penn\u2019s bump in prestige was limited by Trump\u2019s election. Our second closest claim to the White House is the University\u2019s relationship with President Joe Biden and the opening of the Penn Biden Center. I argue that this is as far as Penn\u2019s ties to the presidency will go. Nowadays, Penn\u2019s laser focus on professional development might repel students who will one day have presidential potential.\nComparable institutions to Penn have high-earning graduates and prestigious placements throughout the government, nonprofit sector, and the advocacy space. For example, Georgetown University feeds graduates into congressional offices and many Fulbright programs. Princeton University also regularly features its flashy roster of graduates in powerful political offices. These universities maintain a strong presence in the private sector but are also actively represented in government positions.\n\tIn these examples, the institution itself sponsors an undergraduate school dedicated to public service. At Georgetown, it\u2019s the School of Foreign Service, while at Princeton the role is filled by the School of Public and International Affairs.\nI propose that Penn follow suit and create a fifth undergraduate school dedicated to public affairs. This new school could absorb Penn\u2019s wildly popular social science programs, like PPE (Philosophy, Politics and Economics), Political Science, and Economics. Currently, most students in these majors are scooped up by consulting firms and investment banks. If these students were given an intentional focus on service and social responsibility, perhaps they could feel empowered to use their degrees in a more meaningful way.\nThe least Penn can do is expand its current effort to bridge the gap between social science degree seekers and careers in government and nonprofits. It\u2019s crucial that our student body actively engages with the robust policy infrastructure that Penn has already made available: Civic House, Perry World House, opportunities like Penn in Washington, and extracurricular engagements offered by the Government and Politics Association. From what I\u2019ve seen, these resources are underutilized at Penn. By snubbing them, Penn students are working against the general interests of the University to gain prestige.\n\t\tGet our newsletter, DP Daybreak, delivered to your inbox every weekday morning.Besides, it's about more than just rankings. We have the potential to empower our students to become leaders in society. TIME Magazine ranks Penn as the third-best college for aspiring leaders. However, the article states its rationale for this placement as a concentration of graduates in business careers. Other chart-topping schools on this list were noted for their programs in law, medicine, and more.\nUltimately, private sector homogeneity marks one of Penn\u2019s key weaknesses. As we move forward, Penn has a duty to educate leaders in more than one field. If Penn strengthened its programs in civic engagement, more graduates would be inclined to pursue roles in government and could elevate Penn\u2019s cultural stature. We should be known for more than salaries. We can do more than business.\nJACK LAKIS is a College first year studying political science from Kennesaw, Ga.

          "title": "Mia Vesely | Black Penn is vibrant this month and every month",
          "article_content": "As of late, most of my columns have focused on things I take issue with: Whether it\u2019s Liz Magill\u2019s resignation and the threats to free speech on campus, or the lack of racial diversity in Panhellenic sororities. I haven't highlighted the things that I truly appreciate and, more specifically, the places in which I\u2019ve found community at Penn.\nLast February, I argued that Black history is important for everyone. Education surrounding Black people, their lives, and their contributions should be integrated into the standard curriculum. Black Penn shows up and shows out every month, but this month in particular, there are many events and ways that Penn student organizations uplift the community and come together.\u00a0\n\t\tIt would be impossible to touch on all of these amazing events and their impacts, but I\u2019d like to paint a picture of some of these groups and their initiatives during this month and beyond. Planning for these events takes months. For example, when Descendants of Afro-Americans at Penn (DAAP) \u2014 a club founded just last year \u2014 put on their first-ever gala on Feb. 1 to kick off the month, you better believe that the event was well-planned and executed.\u00a0\nThe gala \u2014 Red Carpet For A Cause \u2014 supported the Sickle Cell Disease Association of America's Philadelphia and Delaware Valley Chapter. The night included catered food, live performances from student groups like The Inspiration, wonderful community, and beautiful decor\u2014even including an ice sculpture of the DAAP logo. Over $1,700 was raised in support of the foundation.\n\t\t\t\tSEE MORE FROM MIA VESELY:\ufeffI dropped sorority rush and I\u2019m gladFirst Liz Magill, next free speechWhen asked about the impacts of the event, College sophomore and DAAP founding member Clarke Dickens said, \u201cWe wanted to bring the community together for a great cause, especially a cause that affects a lot of African Americans and Black people more broadly.\u201d\nSickle cell disease occurs in about one in every 365 Black babies born in the United States. The percentage of Black people who carry the trait is even higher, with one in 13 Black babies being born as carriers.\n\tDickens is not just involved with DAAP, but is also on the boards for QBlack and Shea Collective.\nThese clubs are all part of something commonly dubbed \u201cBlack Penn,\u201d which focuses on so many different aspects of identity. From cultural organizations like Penn African Student Association (PASA), to preprofessional organizations like Black Wharton and the Black Pre-Law Association (BPLA), to community service organizations like the NAACP, all of these organizations put an emphasis on service both inside the Penn community and out.\u00a0\nFor example, Campus Curlz \u2014 a club I serve on the board of \u2014 is, at first glance, a club centered around uplifting natural hair and embracing positivity. \u00a0But underlying hair mask making events and movie nights, there is a strong commitment to service. Just this month, the community service committee held an event where we made Valentine\u2019s Day cards for senior citizens at Mercy Life West Philadelphia.\nService by board members is a requirement to be part of funding organizations like UMOJA \u2014 the umbrella funding organization for Black clubs \u2014 and even beyond that, many clubs center service in every activity they partake in. Whether you\u2019re on the board of a club or not, there are many service opportunities available and encouraged.\nWhen asked what they wish people knew about Black Penn, Dickens said, \u201cClubs should make an effort to include grad students, it makes all the difference. I\u2019m able to say, \u2018This is what I would look like coming here for grad school,\u2019 and it can even offer opportunities for mentorship.\u201d\nWhat seems to drive Black Penn is first and foremost the students, then the supportive and involved faculty, as well as the local partnerships and opportunities the clubs find, build, and pursue for themselves. Many members of the DAAP board are native to Philadelphia, so that makes their work even more personal.\nWhile Black students do take initiative to realize what they need and create the spaces they want to see, there is so much room for improvement on behalf of Penn: whether it\u2019s stratifying the way funding is given to these clubs \u2014 they often can\u2019t fund silverware in UMOJA meetings if it can be provided elsewhere \u2014 or improving the cultural spaces available to students (we were promised the ARCH \u2018building,\u2019 not the ARCH \u2018basement\u2019). In months like February, Penn aims to spotlight their Black students. I just wish this recognition of the incredible community Black students forged for themselves, when they initially didn\u2019t see it on campus, came year-round.\n\t\tGet our newsletter, DP Daybreak, delivered to your inbox every weekday morning.Events like DAAP's gala happen every month, and it\u2019s important not to understate the role these organizations play in making Penn a welcoming and accepting place for students from marginalized backgrounds.\nI was happy to see Faces of Black Penn \u2014 a Black-run publication \u2014 highlighted in the DP last week. I hope people continue to uplift the work of these student groups going forward and make space to give all students their roses. Black History Month is not over, and the time to appreciate Black students and their work does not end come March.\nMIA VESELY is a College sophomore studying philosophy, politics, and economics from Phoenix, A.Z.

          "title": "Bernadine Kumi | I joined a sorority and I\u2019m glad",
          "article_content": "I\u2019ll be honest: I was not a fan of Greek life when I first got to Penn. My perception of Greek life was influenced by growing up in the South, mainly in suburban Georgia. This included a sorority scene of girls with fake spray tans and little to no personality. The images of sorority girls from the University of Georgia and Alabama screamed no diversity, which made me wary of joining a sorority at Penn. Being a First-Generation, Low-Income (FGLI) student made me especially hesitant. Even more so, coming from a Ghanaian household, the notion of a sorority was immediately dismissed as something against our Christian values. Thus, during my first year, I knew I would never, and I mean never, join a sorority.\u00a0\nHowever, by the beginning of sophomore year, my mindset began to change. After a year on campus, I had found a solid community of a small group of friends. But beyond that, I felt that I did not really know anyone. I couldn\u2019t name more than 20 people in my grade. Penn is known for being a networking school, and the \u201cSocial Ivy,\u201d so I began to question just how much I had taken advantage of that. That, along with most of the underclassmen party scene revolving around fraternities, made the idea of rushing even more appealing.\u00a0\n\t\tSo while most people were beginning their sophomore year with the friends they already had, I began to look for additional friends. My twin sister, who also goes to Penn, and I began attending open rush events, talking to sophomores in sororities, and involving ourselves in more social events. Over the next few months, my days consisted of talking to many girls, going to dinners, and putting myself out there in a way that I had been hesitant to do before. I made new friends, met fellow sophomores also in search of a bigger community, and found myself loving the idea of joining a sorority.\u00a0\nBut what made me even more eager was just how inclusive and diverse sororities were at Penn, more so than I had been expecting\u2014especially the off-campus sorority I ended up joining, OAX. I was still wary about rushing, but as soon as I got to the first event, I immediately felt comfortable. There were girls with different interests, passions, economic backgrounds, and personalities. Not a single conversation felt forced. Every girl I met had a unique and authentic story, and I felt like I could talk to them for hours.\n\t\t\t\tSEE MORE FROM BERNADINE KUMI:\ufeffDining hall workers at Penn Hillel demand better treatment from UniversityI was especially captivated by BLOAX (Black OAX), a community within OAX that includes fellow girls of Ghanaian descent and other Black girls who provided me with guidance on navigating Penn as a Black woman. OAX also has other smaller communities, such as LatinOAX and RainbOAX. Being able to find other people with similar backgrounds made the choice to join a sorority that much easier.\u00a0\nAs a FGLI student and Questbridge scholar, the idea of paying high dues out of my minimal work paychecks every month was unfathomable. I knew that joining a sorority would pose another financial burden, and even though I was loving the OAX community, the idea of paying dues scared me. Yet once again, OAX and other sororities surprised me with their understanding and financial transparency. They worked with me to develop an affordable monthly payment plan so that I, like every other girl interested in rushing, could also enjoy being in a sorority.\u00a0\n\tSince the morning of Bid Day when I got \u201cthe call,\u201d I know that I truly made the right decision by joining a sorority, for not only my social life but my professional life too. This past fall, I was able to land a summer internship in Los Angeles with the help of my grand-big. I was also able to prepare for my interview with girls in my sorority, who gave me the confidence I needed to land the opportunity. As a Black woman and FGLI student, I have truly benefited from joining Greek life. I hope students who are hesitant to rush, just as I once was, will see my experience and how transformative it can be. I hope others \u2014 whether they are Black women, FGLI students, or just Penn students in search of a greater community \u2014 can do the same.\nBERNADINE KUMI is a College junior studying political science and legal studies and history from Roswell, Ga.

          "article_content": "Columnist Jessey Shin explores the problem of disparate advising quality in the College and argues \nfor a more standardized experience.\u201cMy advisor lied to me?\u201d\nI remember someone saying this to me in complete disbelief, but I can\u2019t say I\u2019m surprised. Advisors can be as misleading as they are helpful, and this is a widespread problem that needs addressing.\n\t\tIn the College, students typically have between 15 and 20 credits outside of their primary major to meet the graduation requirement. These are used to fulfill general education requirements, pursue a second major or minor, or take elective courses that align with a student\u2019s interests.\nThe freedom to pursue one\u2019s intellectual pursuits is, of course, one of the draws of the College. I am looking to pursue two majors myself, in somewhat interconnected but disparate fields of study: the flexibility offered by the curriculum allows me to explore these interests without taking an obscene number of classes.\n\t\t\t\tSEE MORE FROM JESSEY SHIN:Making a case for the less popular college housesNavigating the maze of Penn's resources\ufeffThe problem is few students go into their first year knowing which major they would like to pursue, much less exactly which courses to take.\u00a0\nThe College puts a lot of effort into informing incoming students about the curriculum and what they have to offer, such as through the Compass module on Canvas that gives a foray into some aspects of the College experience (something that other schools do not offer). However, the sheer number of options can be overwhelming, giving rise to a unique need for personalized, one-on-one guidance. This is where pre-major advisors come in.\u00a0\n\tPre-major advisors, assigned to each student before they start their first semester at Penn, are a vital resource for College students. They guide students through the course selection process, encouraging and helping them as they explore their various interests and eventually settle on a major.\nI can say that I have had a relatively good experience with my pre-major advisor. However, I also found that some of the advice offered was not fully applicable to my circumstance, because of the recent transition from Penn InTouch to Path@Penn.\nOther students, however, are not as lucky. I have heard stories about advisors making their students cry, spreading misinformation, jeopardizing their advisees\u2019 course registration, you name it.\nIn an interview, one student (who requested anonymity) shared that they have had trouble reaching their pre-major advisor from the get-go. College students must meet with their advisor one-on-one to get their course registration hold lifted; without this, they are not eligible to participate in advance registration. The student was only able to reach their advisor a day or so before the deadline and has continued to have trouble with availability.\nOf course, their pre-major advisor experience was less than ideal. \u201cHer guidance wasn\u2019t so much guidance as it was looking at the boxes and seeing if I checked them,\u201d they said. \u201cI don\u2019t think I would feel comfortable going to her for personal issues, such as which major to pursue or how to explore [some of my interests], because I don\u2019t think she would point me [in] the right direction.\u201d Instead, they had been utilizing their PennCAP advisor (available for FGLI students) for these concerns.\nOn the other hand, some students are able to form a positive relationship with their advisor and find that they are helpful in navigating their interests. Rishi Dadlani, a College first year, described his advisor as \u201cfriendly and helpful. He gave me his phone number and told me to contact him if I [had] any questions \u2026 If I saw him around campus, I would say hi, and he always sends us a beginning-of-semester email.\u201d\n\t\tGet our newsletter, DP Daybreak, delivered to your inbox every weekday morning.This disparity in advising quality means that some students are at a great disadvantage compared to others. While some advisors are able to \u201cpoint students in the right direction,\u201d helping them take the right step forward in their college experience, others fall short. Their advisees must navigate the complicated process of learning about the majors, gen-ed requirements, and figuring out (the surprisingly difficult) advance registration process on their own.\nWhen done right, the freedom of the College curriculum can allow students to truly delve into their academic interests and eventually settle on the right path for them. However, that process requires a lot of research and planning that is supposed to be aided by a pre-major advisor. For incoming first years who are unfamiliar with the landscape at Penn and underclassmen students, this disparity in advising quality poses a challenge. Penn must ensure that all students are able to best utilize the resources at their disposal, and the first place to start is with the guidance they receive.\nJESSEY SHIN is a College first-year studying sociology and communications from Seongnam-si, South Korea.

This month offers an opportunity to delve into the depths of history: exploring narratives that challenge, inspire, and provoke thought. In the spirit of true academic inquiry and in honor of this significant month, I wish to highlight a selection of works by Black authors whose perspectives might diverge from the more commonly embraced interpretations of Black history and culture.\n\t\tIn recommending these texts, my intention is not to endorse every opinion expressed by the authors, but to underscore the importance of engaging with a diversity of viewpoints. These authors challenge us to look beyond the prevailing orthodoxy and to question the narratives that have become commonplace within academic circles. They remind us that the Black American experience, like any aspect of human history, is richly diverse and complex.\nAs members of an academic community that prides itself on intellectual rigor and openness, it is our responsibility to explore a broad spectrum of perspectives, especially those that provoke debate and reflection. Let us take this Black History Month as an opportunity to broaden our horizons, engage with ideas that challenge us, and appreciate the rich tapestry of narratives that comprise Black history in America.\n\t\t\t\tRAHEEM WILLIAMS is an Executive MPA student at the Fels Institute of Government and a member of the Committee on Open Expression.

          "article_content": "Upon my acceptance to Penn a couple of years back, I was overwhelmed by an abundance of snooty comments and remarks relating to the city of Philadelphia, sentiments I could not visualize or understand. \u201cHave fun in Filthadelphia!\u201d or \u201cDon\u2019t get shot!\u201d often followed the congrats I received from most people. Not having had a proper vision of Philadelphia\u2019s layout or culture, I soon fell victim to my peers' alarming warnings and became rather cautious and overly attentive in my first weeks as a Quaker. Of course, the University alerts about various armed robberies or the occasional escaped prisoner did not help this berated city\u2019s case.\nWhile Philadelphia does have its safety hazards and concerning instances, I\u2019ve learned that just may be the price of living in a big city \u2014 the sixth biggest in the nation, in fact. Not to fluff up the real and present dangers, but it also should be said that Philadelphia is not much more dangerous than living in San Francisco, Chicago, or Miami, all of which are regarded as highly attractive places to live.\u00a0\n\t\tMany Penn students, coming from places of privilege and very comfortable livelihoods, are quick to harp on and nitpick at Philadelphia\u2019s imperfections. Jokes are constantly made about living in Philadelphia, comparing it to a punishment or drag. Most students are eager to move out, with their eyes set on New York City or Washington D.C., completely blind to the bevy of opportunities offered right here in Philadelphia. What many Penn students seem to overlook is the fact that Philadelphia is an esteemed, bustling, and charming city that many people dream of moving to and working in. Sure, Philadelphia is no tropical paradise, but it serves its purpose as a solid, spiffing city with so much to offer.\u00a0\nSo, instead of joining my peers in badgering on the City of Brotherly Love, I\u2019d like to take this time to highlight the best parts about living in Philadelphia, and hopefully convince you that we are extremely lucky to be going to school in such a vibrant and lively city.\u00a0\n\t\t\t\tSEE MORE FROM SOSE HOVANNISIAN:Penn students deserve more time off from their corporate-style academic calendarsThe pedagogic power of InstagramThe first thing that comes to mind when family or friends ask what I love about Philadelphia is, more often than not, the incredible food scene. Almost every restaurant, cafe, and quick lunch spot I have tried has wowed me, and I\u2019d like to say that that\u2019s a lot coming from a Los Angeles native! Just last year, Philadelphia won four titles in the James Beard Awards, whose prestige can be compared to \u201cthe Oscars, but for food.\u201d Beyond the bevy of choices we have near campus in University City, there are countless hidden gems and highly acclaimed restaurants in Rittenhouse, Fishtown, Northern Liberties, Manayunk, and more. Philadelphia is known for its diversity, and its countless cuisines are here to prove it. \u00a0\nPhiladelphia\u2019s finest cheesesteaks and soft pretzels are great, and they\u2019re best when eaten in the stands of one of the city\u2019s stadiums. Philadelphians beam with pride every time the Phillies, Eagles, Flyers, and 76ers play. Living in a city with this much athletic pride is not only great for our college experience, but it\u2019s also just a good time. Being able to go to these games, engage in the city\u2019s love for the teams, and enjoy city-wide celebrations is something we\u2019re very lucky to have at Penn, where school-wide athletic spirit is low.\u00a0\n\tEven if you\u2019re not one to appreciate sports, you can easily be one to appreciate Philadelphia\u2019s teams in a different way, perhaps by admiring one of the big Phillies murals on the Walnut Street walk to Center City. Philadelphia\u2019s streets are decorated with many murals and public art, coloring the city and demonstrating civic engagement through the expressions of many local artists. What\u2019s more, Philadelphia also offers many outlets to enjoy fine arts, whether it's through a day spent at the Philadelphia Museum of Art or a night at one of its many popular jazz clubs. Last year, Philadelphia was named the Public Art Capital of America, and the Best City in America for Street Art. And to top these accolades, Philadelphia is constantly celebrated for its memorialized history.\nNamed the Nation's First World Heritage City, Philadelphia is also known as the birthplace of the United States. In a city with a history so rich, every building, street, and alleyway has a story worth telling. Independence Hall, Benjamin Franklin, and the Liberty Bell all make this city the perfect historical backdrop for college students, offering countless opportunities to engage with the legacy of this country\u2019s founding fathers and their work. In particular, Philadelphia\u2019s long history of Black trials and tribulations is a key feature of the city\u2019s development. What\u2019s more, Philadelphia has grown into an unbelievably diverse city, boasting a great range of racial, socioeconomic, cultural, sexual, and religious representation. \u00a0\nWhile I have only touched upon some of the things that make Philadelphia so great, every Penn student has the opportunity to explore this big city and discover its many wonders for themselves. Penn\u2019s location, being right across the bridge from Center City, gives all able students the opportunity to just take a brisk walk out of the Penn Bubble and enter a realm of possibilities, opportunities, and new experiences. And for those of you who would rather not get on your feet, the city can just as easily be explored with the comprehensive and convenient SEPTA system.\u00a0\nI call on each and every one of you to take a moment the next time you\u2019re about to bash Philadelphia and consider the validity of what you\u2019re about to say, while also acknowledging our privilege of being here. Learn to love this city, for we know it loves you!\nSOSE HOVANNISIAN is a College sophomore majoring in communications and minoring in history and consumer psychology from Los Angeles, Calif.

          "article_content": "I support the use of ChatGPT.\nA statement that, said aloud, would garner me sidelong stares despite the website\u2019s appearance in many lecture halls.\n\t\tThe use of ChatGPT has raised much debate among students and become a topic of considerable contention. Similarly, many professors hold polarizing views, as the use of generative AI has been harshly rejected in some classrooms while others have tentative policies supporting its usage. The limitation of emerging technology in educational spaces should raise alarm bells, as we are rejecting tools that could be invaluable for facilitating learning. \u00a0\nTo be clear, I am against academic dishonesty, and I haven\u2019t used ChatGPT in a duplicitous manner. However, saying that ChatGPT is synonymous with academic misconduct is a remarkably weighty statement. I do assent that some individuals could use ChatGPT in an academically dishonest way, such as employing it to write papers in their stead. But, a similar result could be accomplished via other online tools, like Google. Just recently, we have become privy to accusations of plagiarism by former Harvard President Claudine Gay, revealing how this is not solely a ChatGPT issue. Thus, our viewpoint of the perpetrator should be reframed, delegating the fault to the person, not the tool.\n\t\t\n\t\nWith the release of GPT-4, many professors and students alike need to reconsider its benefits. Professors already recommend YouTube for content help, so why not ChatGPT?\nChatGPT can be a remarkable asset that provides an advantage to disadvantaged students. Since many Penn students come into university with a deep background in their chosen field of study, which they gained from their access to prep schools or private tutors, the bridge between these two groups is substantial. ChatGPT provides a way to somewhat balance the playing field.\n\tFor one, GPT-4\u2019s added feature of uploading PDFs makes it ridiculously simple to ask questions about lecture content, at any time of the day, while tailoring it to your level of understanding, a skill that many professors and teaching assistants lack. As several professors are utterly immersed in their fields and many TAs have an intuitive grasp of the subject, they are often incapable of making complex topics digestible. Unfortunately, there have been many instances where I gave up on asking questions to avoid receiving a convoluted response.\u00a0\nWith ChatGPT, feedback is immediate, allowing students to reflect on areas of improvement in their work, and providing them with mechanisms to improve over time. Why go through the hassle of setting up TA office hours to ask a simple question when ChatGPT can do it instantaneously?\u00a0\nStudents outside of Penn who do not have access to an educational institution with tutoring facilities also stand to attain so much from receiving academic help from ChatGPT. This is due to its similarity to using online services like Khan Academy, though ChatGPT is much more personalized.\nProfessors who reject the idea of incorporating ChatGPT into classrooms have not considered thinking critically of its beneficial uses. Instead, they are content with adhering to traditional practices, foregoing innovation for comfort. On the other hand, students who are against the usage of AI hold themselves to a higher standard for not relying on outside sources \u2014 similar to many Penn students' views of receiving academic help through services like Weingarten tutoring or office hours. For many, receiving outside help is equated to a lack of intelligence. As with the many Penn students of privileged backgrounds, they do not require additional help and thus look down on disadvantaged students who do require these services.\u00a0\n\t\tGet our newsletter, DP Daybreak, delivered to your inbox every weekday morning.In the end, humans are meant to be adaptable and always have been.

Fighting my brain's battle between an unforced desire to share and an aversion to the anticipated awkward look, I recognized that I would face a long, interminable moment of apnea trying to explain to the world that I do not have two parents because my dad died. Grief exists, and at Penn, it isolates.\nTo be clear, I do not intend to be a prophet speaking universal truths because loss looks different for everyone, but I hope you will find truth in my words nonetheless. Death is a sensitive topic, not the least because it intertwines with cultural, religious, spiritual, and socioeconomic aspects of our identity.

Considering there are 18.58 million college students, that makes us more than 7 million grievers. I guess we are not a minority, are we?\u00a0\nWharton senior Pranavi Karnati lost her father last December after a battle with glioblastoma. She bravely watched him suffer for more than a year and a half, but \u201cdespite the pain he felt, he always managed to make us smile.\u201d She experienced a slower, anticipatory death and described her grief as \u201cisolating.\u201d\n\t\t\t\tSEE MORE FROM FRANCESCO SALAMONE: \ufeffIs Penn about liberal arts or elite jobs?There is no definitively designated place to grieve at Penn. Yes, Student Health and Counseling helps (if you are lucky), but 61% of college counselors in the United States report feeling \u201csomewhat, little, or not comfortable at all\u201d with supporting students primarily on grief. Unlike peer institutions like Princeton that offer grief-focused support groups, Penn lacks such infrastructure. The only comparable program that existed was Actively Move Forward, but it has been inactive since 2019.\nWhat about Philadelphia-based groups? As Karnati shared, before you even get a chance to talk about grief, you may face an identity crisis. \u201cThere are groups for children and groups for adults. What am I? Where are college students supposed to sign up?\u201d\n\tThe result explains why grief feels isolating. Naturally, some prefer to process on their own, but sooner or later, we crave feeling less like an alien and more like we are not the only ones experiencing excruciating pain. And support groups are one easy way to find others who relate.\nOf course, this is only half the problem. Remember, I believe Penn is a detached elite. Having two parents is a privilege: emotionally but interestingly also economically, and substantially so. I cannot blame you for having a privilege you did not choose, but I can and will invite you to reflect on it.\u00a0\nAfter Karnati posted her terrible news, she received several supportive messages: \u201cLmk if you need anything\u201d stood out. She mentioned, \u201cMy loss is making me realize who my true friends really are.\u201d\u00a0\nCan Penn students only support one another through hasty texts with cheap acronyms?\nWe know your \u201cI\u2019m here if you need me\u201d is well-intentioned, but understand that it creates a dilemma by putting the onus of starting the conversation on us, inadvertently burdening the griever even more. The individualistically expeditious culture of Penn is inevitably in direct contrast to the prolonged nonlinear path that grievers experience. At best, Penn students are awkwardly unequipped to support a grieving friend and at worst, fundamentally incapable of slowing down to care and empathize. You can do better.\nLike what? Be present with your friend\u2019s pain, listen with the heart, respect disordered confusion, and discover the gifts of sacred silence over filling words. That is what grief counselor Dr. Alan Wolfelt calls companioning. I wish my friends knew about companionship to ask me about my dad. Ask me what he was like, what he liked to do, what his quirks were. God, just ask me what his name was. When you ask, you are not reminding me that he died (trust me, I know), you are letting me know that you acknowledge that he lived.\nThe truth is I cannot blame them. Part of the matter is institutional and part of it is cultural: Many of us are used to the high school familiarity of knowing at least some family members of our friends. For better or for worse, in college, you are nothing more to others than what you present. And unlike your Canada Goose, you cannot wear your invisible grief when you walk down Locust. What you can wear is a Penn Face and pretend no one died, even with your closest friends, because it is profoundly easier and more tempting than the unfathomable truth.\nSo please, I beg you, next time you come across a griever, think twice before ending the conversation out of discomfort or sending the \u201cI\u2019m here if you need me\u201d text. Think beyond and think deeper. Perhaps take the simplest approach: Sit down with them and see where they will bring you.\n\t\tGet our newsletter, DP Daybreak, delivered to your inbox every weekday morning.If we collectively accept death as a mainstream topic of social dialogue, grief will be easier to handle than to hide. Harvard professor and happiness expert Arthur Brooks says: \u201cGrief does not have to be a private misery and net harm to our lives. We can learn to comprehend it, manage it, and grow from it. And in understanding our own grief, we can help others heal and thrive as well.\u201d\nAfter seven years, I understand my grief, and it is my hope (and Karnati\u2019s recent hope) that these words will help somebody.\nFRANCESCO SALAMONE is a Wharton sophomore from Palermo, Italy.

          "article_content": "This semester, I somehow ended up with four out of my five classes being either directly or indirectly about ethics. As a political science major, I was really excited to take these classes, since whenever people talk about ethics nowadays, it mostly has to do with politics or international relations.\nAt a time when our reality changes so rapidly because of technology, and when we are faced with a number of global challenges, some people have forgotten about the importance of acting morally. Especially at a place like Penn, where everyone seems to be extremely worried about their future and their careers, people often disregard these values when they are caught up by the competitive environment. Because of this, one would think that ethics classes would be extremely beneficial for all, but do they actually contribute to making students more ethical individuals?\n\t\tAccording to my professors, they don\u2019t.\nIn all four ethics classes, my professors started the semester by telling us that ethics classes will not make most of us more ethical. I sat there, listening to all of them, and I just could not understand why they would say something like that. If I wasn\u2019t going to learn anything, what was the point of taking these classes?\n\t\t\t\tSEE MORE FROM ZARA TENA:The urgent need for younger voices in politics\ufeffIt\u2019s okay to be ordinaryThat\u2019s where I was wrong: I have been learning a lot. While perhaps the main goal of ethics classes is not to turn students into more ethical people, they definitely give us the tools we need to critically engage with ethical dilemmas. By taking these classes, I might not become a better person, but they have given me a space where I can explore, discuss, and reflect about where I stand on so many issues and what my beliefs about morality actually are.\nEthics is not a subject that can be forcefully taught through lectures and readings. There is no way that we can sit down for three hours every week and magically become more ethical just because we memorize theories and read long papers written by old white men. The goal of these classes is not to tell us what is \u2018right\u2019 or \u2018wrong,\u2019 \u00a0but to give us the skills to navigate the gray areas in ethical decision making.\n\tThese classes encourage self reflection and personal growth. Even when analyzing big case studies or exploring different theories, students are pushed to question their own values, beliefs, and biases. While this may not guarantee that we will completely transform our moral compasses, the self awareness that comes from these reflections creates a great foundation for understanding why we act the way we do and also invites us to try to understand others.\nThe fact that ethics classes begin with a warning \u2014 that you won\u2019t become more ethical by taking them \u2014 should not stop anyone from giving them a chance. The ability to think critically, understand different values and perspectives, and have the skills to self reflect are essential parts of any college education. They prepare students for the complicated moral dilemmas they might face in their personal and professional lives \u2014 especially when most people at Penn will end up with jobs that are notorious for their ethical scandals!\nZARA TENA is a College sophomore studying political science from Puebla, Mexico.

          "article_content": "How many times have you found yourself in a never-ending cycle of back-and-forth messages, trying to pin down a date for a long overdue catch up with a friend? Every get together begins to feel as if it requires intricate planning and strips away the simplicity of social connection. This routine becomes stifling, lacking spontaneity and authenticity; you\u2019re constrained to coordinating with the same faces in the same places.\u00a0\nThis is what I like to call scheduling fatigue.\u00a0\n\t\tAs a result of this phenomenon, gatherings among friends are beginning to resemble scheduled business meetings, meticulously arranged via tools like When2Meet or synchronized Google Calendars.\nWhile resorting to scheduling may seem like the only viable option to maintain a semblance of social connection, perhaps it's time to embrace the idea of venturing out solo: I\u2019m challenging you to go on an unplanned side quest all by yourself to a third place.\u00a0\n\t\t\t\tMORE FROM LALA MUSTAFA:A nation on defense: Dismantling misinformation against Azerbaijan in the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict\ufeff\ufeffAllow me to explain. Picture the first place as your home and the second as your place of education or work. Now, the third place emerges as a public sphere where individuals congregate, not out of any obligation like in the previously mentioned locations, but, for lack of a more precise term, to simply vibe. It could be the cozy corner of a cafe, a communal park, or even the neighborhood barbershop \u2014 anywhere that\u2019ll allow you to interact with people outside your usual circles.\u00a0\nYet, at many universities like Penn, the concept of a third place seems all but lost as our lives remain restricted to school grounds, causing even our first and second places to converge into one. While spots on campus \u2014 like Stommons, Pret, or the cultural centers in ARCH \u2014 can offer some respite, they often come with the latent pressure of being on the clock. Conversations here revolve around assignments, internships, and the intricacies of Penn culture. The chances of an unexpected encounter dwindle given that most people in attendance will be other Penn students. As we\u2019re cocooned in the Penn bubble, it comes as no surprise that many students spend their four years in Philadelphia without ever fully exploring it.\u00a0\n\tYet, this insulation comes at a cost that extends far beyond what we realize.\u00a0\nIt severs our connection not only from the outside world but also from ourselves. That is, within such limits, our individuality dwindles, reducing us to mere roles influenced by our peers. By excluding ourselves from a wider social sphere, we inhibit opportunities to engage with diverse perspectives, trap ourselves in a cycle of familiarity, and risk leading monotonous lives that pave the way to burnout.\nHowever, in our lives, both intimacy and affiliation with broader communities are essential. While intimacy often stems from our immediate circles, affiliation thrives in third places where spontaneous interactions occur. These spaces facilitate easy contact with new individuals on a regular basis, without the need for prior scheduling. As they consistently offer an opportunity for interaction with others, they end up cultivating the most reliable form of socialization.\u00a0\nSo, if you are keen on exploring new horizons and getting involved in the Philadelphia community, I suggest checking out the many informative articles dedicated to bursting the Penn bubble.\nNevertheless, I want to avoid confining third places to physical locations. They\u2019re more of a mindset, a willingness to embrace spontaneity wherever it may arise. They don't have to be far from campus or require spending money. Instead, third places can be any informal spots you visit \u2014 whether it's your student lounge, the library, or a community center.\u00a0\n\t\tGet our newsletter, DP Daybreak, delivered to your inbox every weekday morning.We often find ourselves caught up in the routines of daily life, clinging to familiar patterns of scheduling and social interaction.

          "title": "Beatriz B\u00e1ez | No closed captioning available",
          "article_content": "Columnist Beatriz B\u00e1ez explains her experience with language fatigue at Penn.On my first day at Penn, I called my father in distress, telling him I needed to move back home and study there as I was going to die alone at this university. My father asked why, and I quickly responded, \u201cI haven\u2019t met anybody in three hours. I have no friends. It\u2019s over for me.\u201d\u00a0\nThat very same night, I went to a New Student Orientation event at Houston Hall. As I nervously paced the floor in my Crocs, I overheard some students speaking Spanish and immediately gravitated toward them. Confessing, \u201cI heard Spanish, and I feel saved,\u201d I ended up meeting three genuine individuals, all from various parts of Latin America. Having arrived in the United States, it felt comforting to hear voices that reminded me of home. This comfort is priceless in such a foreign environment.\n\t\tAll my life, I\u2019ve taken courses in Spanish, spoken Spanish at home, and been berated by my grandmother whenever I spoke too much English. Arriving at Penn, I didn\u2019t anticipate the struggle I would face taking classes taught in English, as I had been lucky enough to have been extensively taught English from a very young age.\nBut speaking in a second language most of the time, even as a fluent speaker, is incredibly draining. Meeting native Spanish speakers at Penn was truly a blessing. However, I have found that some people react adversely to me speaking my primary language. These are not continuous reactions of a high degree, but there have been enough small instances to mark me.\u00a0\n\t\t\t\tMORE ON THIS TOPIC:Students celebrate 40th annual Festival Latinx, honoring Latinx culture on campusLa Casa Latina celebrates 2023 Latinx Heritage Month at PennOn various occasions, I have had Latinx friends say, \u201cLet\u2019s speak English so X person doesn\u2019t feel excluded,\u201d or even resort to English for \u201cconvenience\u201d when we\u2019re alone. For the former, I understand the sentiment. I wouldn\u2019t want someone to be excluded from a conversation in such a way. However, when I\u2019m naturally speaking Spanish, having my speech interpreted as a personal offense is off-putting.\u00a0\nIn one instance, I met a student through a mutual friend on a night out. This friend and I speak fluent Spanish; the person I had just met did not. Throughout the night, I had various conversations with my new acquaintance \u2014 who I found quite amicable \u2014 and my friend. I would naturally speak Spanish with the latter, not thinking much of it. The next morning, my friend told me how the new acquaintance felt I hated them for speaking Spanish in front of them, knowing they didn\u2019t speak the language.\u00a0\n\tI was shocked by the assumption and, in all honesty, a little offended. I found it quite conceited that one would think another person is speaking in their first language to actively exclude them. Speaking in a first language, for me, is purely a relief issue. Although I am fluent in English, after an entire week of speaking it, it can be extremely draining; thus, particularly in a social setting, I don\u2019t want to add to the exhaustion.\u00a0\nIt is more than fine to be curious about what somebody is saying and ask for a translation. However, immediately expressing discomfort upon hearing another language and presuming the other person is talking badly about you is inconsiderate toward them. More often than not, this language switch is for comfort. This was the first of sufficient instances that exposed a pattern in my time at Penn. In another class, I grew close to a few other Spanish-speaking students. One of them continuously suggested we switch back to English for seemingly no valid reason and would reply to any comment of mine in English.\u00a0\nThis harsh reality on campus expands into the club scene. In one instance, a native English speaker attended a club meeting primarily led in Spanish. Within this meeting, if club members asked questions in Spanish, any other members who answered quickly switched to English. Evidently, the intent is to have everybody be able to partake in conversation. However, members within a Spanish-led group should be able to detach from English formalities within club meetings, particularly if the club seeks to embrace Latinx heritage.\u00a0\nSpeaking in my primary language is the greatest manifestation of my culture, particularly since Spanish accents are so diverse throughout Latin America. Having to switch to English not only in academic settings but in seemingly every other sphere of Penn life further disconnects me from the culture I\u2019ve been surrounded by my entire life until now. This applies to any person whose main language isn\u2019t English, not only to Spanish speakers.\u00a0\n\t\tGet our newsletter, DP Daybreak, delivered to your inbox every weekday morning.Penn has students from over 100 countries, with around 19% of the student body being international. If one truly wants to immerse themselves in Penn\u2019s multilingual community, one needs to recognize that a language barrier works both ways. Just as an English speaker may be tired from learning another language, a non-English speaker can be drained from constantly speaking English. It\u2019s crucial to recognize that for the latter, multilingualism surpasses a simple language requirement and spills over to nearly every sector of their life at Penn.\u00a0\nLanguage fatigue is a true reality, especially for individuals who haven\u2019t learned English from a young age. Thus, if somebody within your social group is speaking their first language, which you are not fluent in, it does not give you the right to feel offended or urge them to speak in a tongue you understand. And, if you are a non-native English speaker, as much as you can, \"habla en tu primer idioma y que los dem\u00e1s se ubiquen.\"\nBEATRIZ B\u00c1EZ is a College first year studying mathematics and political science from San Juan, Puerto Rico.

In our instruction at the University of Pennsylvania, we were told to reach for safety and to secure our decadence. So are the students now, but they are not nearly as certain that this is the road they\u2019d really like to walk. The students I knew have already paid that price for that ticket, and their horizons, on a human level, look bleak.\u00a0\n\t\tPhiladelphia is not a college town. It is a real city, a Black city, a poor city whose reality reflects the depth of the American crisis and yet contains the possibilities of its salvation.

The crisis is deepening, and history is accelerating.\n\t\t\n\t\nFewer illusions are possible for the young mind in Philadelphia, which tempers and sharpens it like metal on metal.

The scramble for acceptance into mediocre clubs and fraternities is insufferable, and the false authority these groups stand on in order to make these judgments is embarrassing.

          "title": "Hanadi Abdulkadir | How poor dining hall food shapes our mental and academic capabilities",
          "article_content": "At this point, many Penn students have lived the terrible dining stories at a number of halls across campus. While it\u2019s important to discuss the health and sanitary risks associated with some of these concerns, it\u2019s also necessary to break down how this problem factors into students\u2019 academic and mental well-being.\u00a0\nOpening Sidechat every few days to see yet another picture of undercooked meat or hearing horror stories from my friends dissuades me from trekking across campus to eat at many of our dining halls. Oftentimes, I find myself skipping meals or stretching the time out between each one \u2014 until I accept the fact that I\u2019ll be eating the same food I already ate a couple times that week. Does this mean that I\u2019m probably missing out on some of the necessary vitamins or fiber I should be getting daily? Probably.\n\t\tNumerous Penn Dining Wellness emails live in our inboxes with tips on improving digestive health and practicing better healthy habits in our daily lives. Additionally, the official page for Penn Dining boasts awards and recognitions for sustainability and top college dining. However, the pristine and glossy promotional pictures of sandwiches, smoothies, and breakfast bowls tell a completely different story from the reality on campus.\nWith two of the most historical repeat offenders \u2014 Hill House and 1920 Commons \u2014 being the only consistent options available for on campus dining during the weekend, it\u2019s much more convenient to resort to the other retail spots scattered around campus. However, some of these locations are far apart, depending on where you live, and can add additional costs to weekly expenses. \u00a0\n\t\t\t\tSEE MORE FROM HANADI ABDULKADIR:\ufeffPenn should require an African American history courseWhy social media and Palestinian activism goes hand in handAdditionally, for students who are dishing out a hefty sum of money to enroll in the dining plan, going out of their way to seek expensive alternatives takes away money that could\u2019ve been better spent elsewhere. Considering that first years and sophomores are required to pick a dining plan for their first two years at Penn, it\u2019s no wonder that students have consistently called for the food standards to match the high prices of these meal swipes. Ideally, no student should feel like they need to resort to options outside of Penn; rather, outside options should be supplemental to an already quality level of options at all dining halls.\u00a0\nSince coming to Penn, my relationship with food has become much more complex. I need to look twice when picking out a seemingly clean utensil to eat whatever is on my plate or stare extra hard at my salad with suspicion before consuming it. But growing up, food was always a way for me to connect with my family and friends, to bring us back together even when we hadn\u2019t seen each other in a long time. Yet the food at Penn, at its worst, has left me frustrated and succeeded at suppressing my appetite \u2014 something I actually can relate to other students about.\n\tAlthough certain foods are scientifically linked to improving mental clarity and focus, I hesitate in reaching for those vegetables because they don\u2019t look as fresh or appetizing when lined up on display in Kings Court English House. As a result, I look for short-term solutions in coffee, which leaves me feeling tired earlier in the day or exhausted while trying to tackle my assignments at night. In order to meet my immediate deadlines, I prioritize some assignments over others, meaning some classes suffer in academic performance and perpetuate an almost never-ending cycle of playing catch-up. I believe that the root cause of all these problems can be traced back to the lack of decent dining.\u00a0\nThis same sentiment has been echoed by many of my friends and peers. But the dining quality at Penn can be mitigated if the University addresses the root problem. Whether that be promoting clean and sanitary workspaces when handling food or streamlining student complaints to Penn Dining other than through email, the University can restore student faith in the system. When it comes to campus dining, Penn can improve upon our experiences by implementing the changes that students deserve to enjoy, especially at the height of midterm season.\nHANADI ABDULKADIR is a College sophomore studying international relations from Philadelphia.

They'll be global, builders and in the right group chats.\u201d His readers agree, with one commenter further emphasizing that \u201cuniversities cannot keep up with the pace of free market innovation.\u201d When these schools attempt to go against the grain and align with consumer needs, \u201cit genuinely looks embarrassing and out of date.\u201d\n\tIn an environment where the use of AI models is largely democratized, we\u2019re naturally drawn to the trope of a layperson who forgoes bureaucratic systems to channel their intelligence: creating life-changing inventions that would have never come to be under self-serving corporate and political influences. And when ignoring cases of succor \u2014 as mainstream media unfortunately does \u2014 there are many examples of such successes. Bill Gates and Paul Allen, co-founders of Microsoft, were university dropouts. So were Meta Platforms co-founders Mark Zuckerberg and Dustin Moskovitz. As Penn\u2019s over reliance on donors came to light earlier this school year, critics of the upper crust have continued to group Penn with other perpetrators of social stratification. The field of AI is, by nature, continuously evolving. And limiting growth in the discipline to those who can afford, and then succeed in Penn\u2019s Department of Computer and Information Science courses is counterproductive.\nHowever, these narratives misrepresent the intentions of Penn\u2019s AI program.\nTo make a better case for Penn\u2019s AI major, I spoke with Robert Ghrist, Andrea Mitchell Professor and associate dean for undergraduate education at Penn Engineering. He describes how the process of integrating AI in education is similar to the effects of increasing access to music recording and playback technologies. Now, there is \u201cmore music for everyone at much lower prices,\u201d he told me. Nonetheless, \u201cartists at the very top of the industry\u201d are increasingly the benefactors of \u201ca concentration of rewards.\u201d Taylor Swift is, as any current news feed can attest to, perhaps the most prolific embodiment of such phenomena. And professor Ghrist strives to make Penn an incubator of sorts for the \u201cTaylor Swifts of AI\u201d that seek avenues for academic growth, to actually be the \u201cleading edge where the best thrive.\u201d\nAnd to thrive in this discipline, aspiring AI mavens are off course by simply memorizing browser instructions in JavaScript and praying for a tech equivalent of the coveted Goldman Sachs internship. After all, studying AI is a philosophical pursuit: an inquiry into the nature of consciousness and ethics of creating sentient machines. It\u2019s also a political pursuit, for AI poses challenges in regulatory compliance. There are countless possible liabilities for even the most basic ChatGPT input, such as unprotected user data and violations of intellectual property rights. \u00a0\n\t\tGet our newsletter, DP Daybreak, delivered to your inbox every weekday morning.Needless to say, as you might have noticed in my earlier columns, I am not an AI major. I\u2019m not even enrolled in Penn Engineering. Am I, of all students, in the right to quash critics of the Penn AI major when I dropped AP Computer Science in high school (with no regrets)?\nYet, it\u2019s clearly irresponsible to follow the well-intentioned advice from tech capitalists when constant innovation is not particularly ideal for society. Maybe I\u2019m just afraid of a \"Black Mirror\"-esque dystopia, but there is a kind of ominous quality to the idea of highly skilled AI scientists off the reins. Penn, however, is cultivating an ecosystem that nurtures AI talent, albeit not by stifling the next Elon Musk or Sam Altman with red-tape-ridden academics; instead, Penn fosters ethically conscious innovation that addresses complex societal challenges. And so, the fact that I can engage with the Penn curricula across departments has a surprising beauty. The opportunity to become a part of this technological movement \u2014 or, dare I say, revolution \u2014 is the gift of studying AI at Penn.\nMRITIKA SENTHIL is a first year studying management and Russian and east European studies from Columbia, S.C.

          "title": "Akiva Berkowitz | An AI major by any other name ",
          "article_content": "Artificial intelligence is a topic we can\u2019t seem to get enough of. From frequent announcements regarding policies within classrooms to endless professors and visiting scholars weighing in on the unprecedented effect large language models will have on our lives, I\u2019m sure we\u2019ve all discussed to death how revolutionary ChatGPT has become for college students.\u00a0\nMany of us have even had the chance to firmly establish positions on whether the University should embrace the technology wholeheartedly or put in place safeguards to prevent it from eroding the value of a college education, but up until now, the vast majority of conversations have been on a non-technical level.\n\t\tThat all potentially changed in this past month when Penn announced their first Bachelor of Science in Engineering in AI. Thankfully for us, Penn has chosen to launch this interdisciplinary degree at the \u201coptimal time\u201d to \u201ccreate a society where AI isn\u2019t just a tool, but a fundamental force for good to advance society.\u201d But at what cost? To what extent should we be using college as an opportunity to hyperfocus on not just a certain field (computer science), but a field within a field? Majoring in AI panders to the pre-professionalism Penn is known for and removes many of the foundational elements of the field that underlie innovation.\u00a0\nIn an interesting recent LinkedIn post, David Magerman pondered the implications of a university building complete undergraduate curriculums around a \u201cmodern business tool that is a niche application of computer science, diverting students away from a broad education in computer science.\u201d He went on to ask pointedly, \u201cWhat's next? A Bachelor of Arts in Blogging from the Annenberg School? A Wharton BS in Quantitative Trading?\u201d\n\t\t\t\tSEE MORE FROM AKIVA BERKOWITZ:The newsletter is dead\ufeffIsrael under attack: What do you stand for?As a current computer science major, I\u2019ll admit the AI curriculum looks fascinating. There is such an array of eye-catching electives (from Deep Generative Models to Natural Language Processing) that, if I were doing my degree all over again, I suspect I would have been swayed to switch into the major. But as a recently graduated computer and information science friend put it, the degree \u201cseems like the cool parts of CIS\u201d without the heavier basics like operating systems, computer systems, and physics \u2014 building blocks on the entire computer domain. \u00a0\nThe question I ask myself is whether artificial intelligence is really enough of an independent field that it transcends computer science and necessitates its own major. Is the relatively new field of AI established enough, broad enough, and unique enough such that the skills we gain through taking just those mostly career-focused courses today will undoubtedly remain relevant in 30 years and justify the $84,600 a year sticker price? I simply wonder how likely it may be that AI will become so unrecognizable in 20 or even 10 years, given its breakneck pace of innovation, that students may have wished that their majors in college focused on more fundamental elements of the field that innovators keep turning back to for insight.\u00a0\n\tAside from long-term career effectiveness an AI degree would have compared to computer science or electrical engineering, Penn is known for its pre-professional student body, and this new major shows signs of that sentiment leaking into the curriculum as well. In contrast to the Penn Integrates Knowledge professorships that bring in academic leaders who deeply understand multiple fields to better spark insight between them, this new major filters various courses of study to pluck out the elements we find valuable today.\u00a0\nIn this line of thinking, maybe we should consider the true value of a groundbreaking Wharton degree in quant trading that would promise to \u201csculpt the financial moguls of tomorrow\u201d with unparalleled prowess in algorithmic trading strategies and quantitative analysis.\u00a0\nAll this is to say, I immediately understand the value the current AI concentration within the larger CIS curriculum has. And I appreciate the Ph.D. programs that take students to a higher level of understanding, once they\u2019ve taken the time in their undergraduate training to build the broad foundations. I simply remain curious of the true value an AI undergraduate degree offers us as students over other forms of study within the field and the certain level of indulgence in pre-professionalism that it plays into on Penn\u2019s campus. I truly hope that I\u2019m proven wrong.\nAKIVA BERKOWITZ is an Engineering junior studying computer science from Silver Spring, Md.

          "title": "Eric Najera | Penn must take action to enhance the dining experience",
          "article_content": "As busy college students, most of us do not have time to cook our own meals, and if you are anything like me, cooking is far from your forte. The hassle of having to go to the grocery store, cook, and clean can be time consuming and even more difficult when you\u2019re overwhelmed with classes, clubs, and homework. For the many students without access to a kitchen in their dorm, this presents an even bigger challenge. Luckily, college campuses have dining halls! Students simply swipe their card to get access to an all-you-care-to-eat dining experience. Dining halls provide easy access meals to students\u2014but what happens when that food is inedible?\nAs a picky eater, I know that simply because I do not like a dish does not mean it is unsafe to eat, but food with cockroaches and glass is unsafe for anyone. A seemingly obvious underlying assumption in dining is that food is safe to eat. College dining halls should be a place where students go to eat well-cooked, hairless, and insect-free food. However, that is not the case at Penn: There is a lack of responsibility to make sure the food is meeting basic standards for, let alone satisfying, all students.\u00a0\n\t\tMeal plans are far from cheap. For the sticker price, students would expect quality food, but they would be wrong. Both of the first-year student meal plan options cost $6,330, with the maximum amount of swipes being 296. Each meal swipe equates to roughly $17, which is about the same price as a Caniac Combo at Raising Cane's. As previously stated, Penn dining hall food is far from gourmet, and its price is too high for the quality delivered.\u00a0\nExpensive dining plan meals are not unique to Penn, but other Ivy League schools have similar prices for better quality food. Cornell University offers an unlimited meal plan, so students may visit the dining halls as much as they want with a fixed cost of $6,942 for food ranked second-best in the nation. So, for roughly 600 more dollars, Cornell students have access to unlimited meals and substantially better quality dining.\u00a0\n\t\t\t\tSEE MORE FROM ERIC NAJERA: \ufeffWe should be grateful to attend PennPenn clubs should have an assigned faculty member\ufeffAside from price and quality, weekend dining is another struggle. With the popular McClelland Sushi & Market and Houston Market being closed on Saturdays and the other dining halls closing at 8 p.m., food options are limited. Late-night study sessions means having to resort to local food places that remain open, and unlike nearby schools such as Drexel, our dining dollars do not work at off-campus restaurants and out-of-pocket money spent on takeout can add up quickly.\nBefore every school break, Sidechat is flooded with posts of excitement for home-cooked meals. In my classes, when asked what we are excited for, most students reply being able to eat good food. It is not uncommon for college students to miss their home-cooked meals, but when students are excited to actually eat food that is not served alongside insects, it signifies a problem.\n\tWith Penn\u2019s Bon App\u00e9tit contract still in place, we may not know how much Penn can do to change the dining experience. Safe, clean food should not be an unreasonable expectation. In order to enhance a student's experience outside the classroom, Penn must budget for an edible food experience for all students.\nERIC NAJERA is a College sophomore studying history from Rolling Meadows, Ill.

          "title": "Zaid Alsubaiei | Does Penn\u2019s diversity represent its sense of community?",
          "article_content": "We all know the typical \u201ctypes\u201d of high schoolers, the different clich\u00e9s: Where are my nerds at? But, another attribute of student groups that has become increasingly relevant in the 21st century United States is the diverse ethnic makeup of its population. And, frankly, do we as a campus mirror all that comes with that national trend of diversity?\nThink of the friends with whom you often hang out. Then, ask those friends with whom they usually go out. Finally, think of the groups you are a part of, the extracurriculars in which you partake. Notice a pattern?\n\t\t\u201c[D]espite increased opportunity to live and work in mixed-race settings, Americans remain racially segregated in their friendship patterns,\u201d a study published by the National Institutes of Health found. \u201cSpatial racism, cultural encapsulation, and personal choice are contributing factors for patterns of same-race friendships.\u201d\u00a0\nThis pattern seems to reflect the divisions present in Penn\u2019s social scene as well. Despite coming from all sorts of backgrounds across the world, the University\u2019s students appear to have unconsciously adopted a policy of self segregation. In other words, we like to \u201cstick to our own\u201d by socializing with others to whom we relate to on a cultural, ethnic, or religious basis. So, regardless of Penn\u2019s efforts to integrate people of differing experiences and beliefs, there still remains a degree of resistance by individuals themselves to cross those racial or cultural lines.\n\t\t\n\t\nAs a result, the potential for diversity of thought is threatened. A narrow mindset develops within these groups that students pledge to, and they effectively act as echo chambers that exacerbate already crippling political polarization. We relate to each other less, rely on our \u201cown\u201d more, and become less tolerant of the views, and thus experiences, of those who do not necessarily look, think, or speak like us.\nThis kind of thinking \u2014 whether manifested in the form of race, religion, or otherwise \u2014 has led to serious tension at times and enabled a distorted view of certain communities and how they experience Penn. I attribute part of that thinking not to the identity groups we are a part of, but to how much we value them over who we are as individuals.\n\tHomogenous communities definitely have their place in the college experience: They help ease our transition when we first arrive at Penn, and their role cannot be replaced. I say this as an international student myself, who had a hard time acclimating to an entirely different culture and, most radically, diet. Nonetheless, we should treat these organizations as an aid to finding belonging on campus, not a substitute for individual thought and expression.\nHowever, none of this means individuals can\u2019t agree or always need to separate themselves from the group. The use of a large, collective voice can benefit our campus much more than we realize. What is important to note is that there lies a clear distinction between acknowledging the views of others and forcing ourselves to accept those views for the sake of conformity.\nThere is nothing wrong with disagreeing with the majority, whether it is one against two or one against a nation (though some may try to tell you otherwise). As long as you are respectful and driven by a desire to learn rather than defend, there are no limits on what perspective you may question. So, challenge your beliefs, reevaluate your viewpoint, challenge that of others (no matter who they are), and then reevaluate yourself again. It\u2019ll be hard at first, to express your precise, genuine thoughts without fear. But, remember that you\u2019re not alone (I struggle sometimes myself) and that it\u2019s a process you won\u2019t always get right.\n\t\tGet our newsletter, DP Daybreak, delivered to your inbox every weekday morning.The hardest part of breaking out of groupthink, after realizing it, is talking about it. My advice? Take the plunge and never look back. The next time you are in a group and the majority agrees with an idea you don\u2019t like, let it be known. Talk about it and explain why you think the way you do. Don\u2019t worry if some get offended or others simply do not agree; it is normal and, in fact, expected.\u00a0\nNever forget that disputes you engage in are an opportunity, not a challenge, and our differences are enlightening, not threatening. Only then will we begin to understand and appreciate each other more as unique actors in a truly historic community.\nZAID ALSUBAIEI is a College first year studying economics from Al-Khobar, Saudi Arabia.

          "title": "Eliza Carroll | You are what you read: Sidechat\u2019s impact on campus",
          "article_content": "I downloaded Sidechat this fall after my friends sent me too many screenshots of funny memes or jokes posted on the anonymous app. I figured that doing so would simply remove the middleman. I was already being exposed to the same jokes, memes, comments and judgements as those on the app anyway \u2026 right?\u00a0\nIn December, I returned home for reading days and fell into an easy pattern of studying. Nothing I did was wildly exciting or social, but I instead found myself enjoying the routine and satisfaction of productivity. During my study breaks, I would scroll on Sidechat \u2014 and from the comfort of my home, I felt myself spiraling into anxious dread about returning to Penn. Each time I opened the app, I was faced with a barrage of posts all echoing the same sentiment: Penn is awful and depressing. Without a second thought, I accepted those posts as fact, and in doing so, I allowed Sidechat to have more power than it deserves. In other words, I subscribed to the complaining culture that is pervasive on Sidechat.\u00a0\n\t\tUsing Sidechat, especially without intentional thought, is a way of looking at Penn through hypercritical glasses. Perhaps this is because negativity has been normalized and cynicism gets more upvotes. To some extent, this pessimistic messaging is diluted with the insertion of mildly entertaining memes or jokes, but the result is still the same. With each scroll, Sidechat is perpetuating a defeatist perspective of Penn.\u00a0\nSo, I arrived back at Penn to take my final exam: openly unhappy about returning to what I thought would be a bleak campus as a result of discourse on Sidechat. But to my surprise, it was not horrific, and I was able to enjoy my weekend of studying just as I had my week at home. The sheer volume of disheartening posts on Sidechat had clouded my perspective and ability to see the best in the situation. Sure, I was becoming one with a Huntsman GSR while others were at home enjoying break, but on the other hand, I was with my friends and able to have a sleepy campus all to myself.\n\t\t\t\tAs is the case with most other social media platforms, Sidechat is consumed passively and without a second thought \u2014 it\u2019s used to pass time, curb boredom, and satiate our addictions to our phones. And yet, students are absorbing and internalizing content more quickly than they can truly digest it.\u00a0\nGiven the bandwagon culture on Sidechat, users often build off of one another, creating a chaotic, and often dismal, echo chamber that does not truly represent life at Penn. Whether or not college is the best four years of your life, it is at least what you make of it, and Sidechat enables students to feel like victims of an unknown cause. For those who are actually struggling, Sidechat acts not as a productive outlet, but rather as a meta ether that provides no remedy other than the satisfaction that others are unhappy too.\u00a0\n\tSince winter break, I have in fact deleted Sidechat and am all the better for it. I still get sent the best and the brightest jokes by my friends, but I am no longer overwhelmed by unsolicited complaints on an hourly basis. Without Sidechat, my thoughts on the housing lottery, the floods in the Quad, and upcoming midterms are completely my own. Deleting Sidechat may not be for everyone, but it\u2019s imperative for those who chose to use Sidechat to take a more critical view of what is being circulated and evaluate whether or not they are benefiting from it. It may just change the way they see Penn.\u00a0\nELIZA CARROLL is a College first year studying international relations and art history from Greenwich, Conn.

          "title": "Cathy Li and Liala Sofi | History can\u2019t repeat itself; stand with Chinatown",
          "article_content": "Students for the Preservation of Chinatown protested outside the Board of Trustees meeting held at the Inn at Penn on Mar. 3, 2023. \nA few weeks ago, the streets of Chinatown came to life with firecrackers and lion dances ringing in the year of the dragon. As you walk through the brightly colored 40-foot paifang \u2014 known to most as Chinatown\u2019s Friendship Gate \u2014 you enter into a cultural oasis that has stood strong in the heart of Philadelphia for nearly 150 years. Beyond this fixture, Chinatown serves as a home to nearly 3,000 residents and numerous family-owned businesses, restaurants, shops, and community organizations. Whether you are going to Ken\u2019s Seafood Restaurant for a fun night out or Heng Fa for groceries, Chinatown feels like home.\u00a0\nUnfortunately, this community has been under constant attack for decades and is once again facing the threat of displacement and gentrification from a plan to develop an arena for the Philadelphia 76ers merely a block away. We firmly stand with the Students for the Preservation of Chinatown and urge you to do the same. \u00a0\n\t\tSince the early 1900s, Chinatown has been a victim of gentrification often driven by predatory infrastructure projects. In 1932, the construction of subway infrastructure at Ridge and Eighth streets \u2014 and the subsequent development of the Vine Street Expressway from 1957 to 1991 \u2014 resulted in the destruction of buildings and severe divisions within the community. Bringing in noise and pollution, the expressway eroded neighborhoods and people's quality of life. This was not Chinatown's sole battle, however, as it also faced multiple proposals of developments for a federal prison in 1992, a baseball stadium in 2000, and a casino in 2008.\u00a0\nThe story of Philadelphia's Chinatown mirrors other Chinatowns across the nation. Amid the 1994 fiscal crisis in Washington, D.C., then-Washington Wizards owner Abe Pollin negotiated a deal for the downtown Capital One Arena, where the city covered pre-development costs to acquire and demolish properties. Entrepreneurs in Washington's Chinatown voiced concerns about prices of real estate skyrocketing and parking impacts on businesses in the area. A decade later, most Chinese residents were forced to move out due to unaffordable housing. The parking shortage led to the closure of the last Chinese grocery store, accelerating the decline of the Chinese American population in the area to fewer than 400 residents today. Ironically, as D.C.\u2019s arena now relocates to the suburbs, the community is left behind, having endured irreversible destruction while in the midst of its recovery from the pandemic.\u00a0\n\t\t\t\tMORE FROM LIALA SOFI AND CATHY LI:Liala Sofi | The hypocrisy of billionaire philanthropistsCathy Li | Philadelphia\u2019s changing tastesIn New York\u2019s Chinatown, threats of displacement and economic insecurity also loom high. In 2021, the Museum of Chinese in America accepted a donation of $35 million in support of a borough-based jail complex which would displace Chinese American working-class people in the area. On top of that, its board executives were connected to the closing of the last unionized restaurant, beloved Jing Fong banquet hall, and construction of luxury towers that are actively raising rent and real estate taxes in the area.\nIn Philadelphia, the current 76Place project is being developed by 76 DevCo, an initiative by 76ers managing partners Josh Harris, David Blitzer, and David Adelman. Adelman is at the forefront of the construction of the arena and has promised not to displace the residents or businesses in Chinatown, but his past actions speak louder than his current words. Adelman works closely with Brett Altman, who also owns the University City Townhomes, and was a key figure behind the demolition and end of affordable housing in the West Philadelphia area that was previously known as the \"Black Bottom.\u201d This constant cycle of displacing residents and communities that have lived in the area for generations must end, and we must be the voice to make this happen.\n\tDevelopers of the project have stated that the arena will \u201cserve as a model for an equitable & inclusive community,\u201d yet there is not a single mention of Chinatown in the proposal. Efforts to ensure communities can benefit from this project read as empty promises when nearly 95% of residents, business owners, and visitors oppose the arena\u2019s construction.\nMany questions posed by residents have also gone unanswered by 76 DevCo. How will restaurants and small businesses in the surrounding area be protected? Who will clean the streets after huge events?\u00a0\nPreserving Philadelphia's architectural heritage demands careful consideration in urban development, but the development of the arena does the exact opposite \u2014 jeopardizing accessible low-income and senior housing complexes, healthcare clinics, and schools for children.\nPenn has direct ties to the developers in the area, and students should be cognizant of the situation. Adelman currently sits on Penn Medicine Board of Trustees and is the CEO of Campus Apartments, which houses many Penn students off-campus. But more importantly, Penn students are directly and indirectly involved in the Chinatown community, whether that be Penn Lions performing all throughout the city for Lunar New Year, or student groups like SPOC organizing initiatives to honor traditions celebrating the multi-ethnic communities that reside there.\u00a0\nDespite what greedy developers may suggest, Chinatown is not an ethnic theme park but a home. It\u2019s more than just a place to eat, it\u2019s a support network and a cultural hub for immigrants and visitors alike.\nIn the face of ongoing threats, Chinatown has demonstrated remarkable resilience and activism, advocating for the needs of all diverse communities of color that are integrated into the cultural fabric of our city. The next time you are in Chinatown, take a look around at all the place has to offer. Venture into Ebisu for some home decor and enjoy a Mochinut donut as you shop. Come by Dae Bak for soul-nourishing Korean barbecue. The opportunities to support your favorite restaurants and local businesses are endless.\nPlease don't turn a blind eye to what is happening outside the Penn bubble. Pay attention to what SPOC and other organizers are doing in the fight for the preservation of Chinatown. Educate yourself on what is going on in Chinatowns across the country. If you can, participate in programming like Crane Chinatown Community Center art exhibitions or Show Your Love for Chinatown events to learn more about the challenges facing the neighborhood. Sign petitions. \u00a0\nAdorned with dragon motifs, and gorgeous ornamental roof tiles, the Friendship Archway is not only an architectural masterpiece, but a labor of love \u2014\u00a0created for community by community. The engineers and artisans from Tianjin, China \u2014 Philadelphia\u2019s sister city \u2014 came together with residents and the city of Philadelphia to fund and invest in Chinatown, and you should too.\u00a0\nThe next time you walk through the gate, remember that the fight for Philadelphia\u2019s Chinatown, and Chinatowns everywhere, is not over.

          "article_content": "My guess is that nearly everyone reading this article knows someone who has been academically disingenuous, or been that someone before. Being academically dishonest isn\u2019t all about flashy examples, like the two admitted Penn students accused of plagiarism and fabricating data in 2022. There are smaller violations that may feel less egregious, or even harmless, like querying ChatGPT for help completing your homework, peeking at a friend\u2019s lab assignment, or answering a PollEverywhere as if you\u2019re in class, when really, you\u2019re snoozing in your dorm.\nAcademic dishonesty is having a moment in the spotlight. The advent of generative AI, the use of which cannot be reliably detected by grading softwares, will likely upend student learning for better or worse. At the same time, examples of plagiarism by prominent academics are being dug up left and right. The former president of Harvard, Claudine Gay, was ousted in part due to plagiarism concerns, and Business Insider found that former MIT professor Neri Oxman (the wife of billionaire Bill Ackman, who led the campaign against Gay) \u201cstole sentences and whole paragraphs from Wikipedia, other scholars and technical documents in her academic writing.\u201d\n\t\tTo be clear, I believe that academic dishonesty at Penn \u2014 going against community standards that your professor has explicitly outlined \u2014 is unacceptable, and that we should be doing more to penalize and prevent it.\nNevertheless, we must also acknowledge that academic dishonesty is understandable, in that we can piece together students\u2019 rationales when they do cheat, and even sympathize with them in some cases.\n\t\t\t\tSEE MORE FROM CAROLINE MAGDOLEN:\ufeffThe Rat Kings of PennThere\u2019s no better time for climate education\ufeffTo dissuade academic dishonesty, we employ sayings like, \u201cIt will only hurt you in the long run to cheat,\u201d or \u201cYou\u2019re taking advantage of other students who've completed their work fairly.\u201d This is true in some circumstances.

And if MATH 1400 is curved, your dishonest success capitalizes on the honest failures of others \u2014 not cool.\nBut this is not true in all cases. Jane* was a first year in her spring term when she was taking CIS 1210: Data Structures and Algorithms \u2014 a famously challenging CIS course \u2014 with Rajiv Gandhi, a famously challenging professor.\u00a0\n\tShe cheated on her coding assignment late into the semester, and as per the professor\u2019s policy, received a -300/100 on the submitted homework and zeros on all previously submitted homework, receiving a D as her final grade in the course.\nBut Jane believes that what is more important to her story is not what happened, but why it happened.\u00a0\n\u201cWhat drove me to make a bad decision? Why are [these classes] so infamous? It\u2019s because of notorious policies where you cannot collaborate on many assignments. You are given long problem sets to do, on your own, each week, with desperate students in office hour queues that are two to four hours long. Many times, you will go to the TA and not get a clear answer. It is a profoundly isolating situation, particularly for freshmen just entering college, and that\u2019s what drives well-meaning people to cheat.\u201d\nBased on my conversation with Jane, it seemed that she felt isolated at the time and was struggling to reach out for the support that she needed, both in CIS 1210 and at Penn as a whole. And given the limited support Jane could receive from TAs and her instructor, backtracking her friend\u2019s code felt more conducive to her learning than doing nothing.\nJane expressed a lot of remorse over what happened, and said that she still has a lot of respect for Rajiv, maintaining a good relationship with him to this day. She was also grateful that Rajiv was willing to handle this internally, since a low grade in the class looks better than a formal statement on her transcript, detailing her violation of academic integrity.\n\u201cI deserved to be punished harshly,\u201d Jane said. \u201cBut the collaboration policies of these introductory courses, and the punishment I received, wrecked my self-esteem and my early college experience. I felt that there was no way out.\u201d\nAccording to Jane, Rajiv's philosophy is to \"let go of your grades early: the sooner you stop caring about your GPA and start caring about learning, the better.\" She agrees with this philosophy, especially since he curves his courses generously, but sees this as out of touch with the realities of many Penn students.\nAfter students have prioritized perfecting their grades and resumes (and have been praised for it) in high school, those habits won\u2019t get undone overnight. Even at Penn, there are many institutions and accolades that continue to reward \u201cperfect\u201d performance over pursuing difficult academic disciplines, experimenting, and invariably messing up sometimes.\nFrankly, for a pre-med student in computer science (a track which Jane was considering at the time), the adage that \u201ccheating will hurt you in the long run\u201d skill-wise doesn\u2019t hold much water. The skillset of a future doctor and a software engineer just don\u2019t overlap enough. What can hurt a pre-med in the long run is a low GPA.\nAnd while there are some students for whom projects, internships, and technical interviews will get them a lot further in guaranteeing their success, this is not true for everyone. For many preprofessional students who may want to challenge themselves with a major or minor in CIS, they risk getting shut out of the study altogether.\nWhat frustrates me most about this entire situation is not that such harsh action was taken, but that it appears ineffective in tackling the issue at hand. If a student wanted to cheat, they could just take CIS 1600 or CIS 1210 during a different semester, when a different instructor was in charge and penalties were anecdotally known for being less harsh.\nWhile Jane\u2019s actions were clearly wrong, I can\u2019t help thinking that she was just the unlucky example that had to face the music, and she said as much in our interview: \u201cEveryone cheats in this class. You don\u2019t survive [CIS 1600 or CIS 1210] without talking to people, it just depends on whether you get caught. That doesn\u2019t make cheating okay, but it does mean that we need to rethink how these courses operate.\u201d\nSo, what can we do so that not everyone cheats?\nThis is a complex question, and there is no easy answer. It is crucial that as we frame the issue of academic integrity violations, we look at both the violations themselves and the root motivations that drive them \u2014 these actions are not taking place in a vacuum.\u00a0\nAcademic integrity violations these days are, to an extent, simply easier to commit. ChatGPT has led to a surge in \u201cunfair advantage\u201d violations. And even before generative AI, the pandemic had uprooted our usual test-taking environment. Now that classes are in person again, we no longer need to have take-home or open-Internet exams, but these still persist in some classes, and are easier to cheat on. Penn, given its history of fraudulent alumni, isn\u2019t going to be a place where professors can blindly trust students to refrain from cheating when presented with the option, so professors should take some responsibility for leveling the playing field in the classroom too.\u00a0\nJulie Nettleton, the executive director of Penn\u2019s Center for Community Standards and Accountability (CSA), relayed over email that CSA already works closely with schools and centralized resources at Penn to discuss how to proctor exams, and with faculty to discuss exams, syllabi language, and classroom policies.\nWhat constitutes a violation itself is currently not standard across classes, or even across different sections of the same class. How to handle a concern of academic integrity falls to the professor first \u2014 this is how Jane completed CIS 1210 with a lower grade, rather than a formal sanction from the CSA. It makes sense to delegate this responsibility to professors: It is more efficient than having the CSA handle every case, and professors should have the freedom to decide what constitutes cheating in their classrooms.\nHowever, this does open the door to students deliberately choosing sections of a course with professors that have more relaxed academic integrity policies. Conversely, some professors can be overly harsh, to the point where they are acting unfairly towards their students.\u00a0\nJill*, another student that I interviewed for this article, was falsely accused by her professor of collaborating on her final exam with her peers. At the start of winter break, the professor sent a class-wide email imploring those who worked together on the take-home exam to turn themselves in or have the matter escalated. Jill recalls that for students that turned themselves in, the professor lowered their grades accordingly \u2014 everyone else was reported to the CSA.\nIn the end, Jill\u2019s name was cleared, but she was assigned a case manager that seemed to have assumed she was guilty by default. As the case progressed, many of the details that the professor used to build the case against her appeared superfluous \u2014 for example, she and her friends had all rounded to the same decimal place in their work. Jill suspects that the escalation may have been personal: she had previously asked the professor, on behalf of the class, if he could make changes to his teaching style to facilitate learning.\nIt seems wrong to me that a professor could accuse a student and cause such extensive stress when in the end, Jill turned out to be innocent. It reminded me of some other methods that professors use to catch students cheating, such as Turnitin\u2019s flawed AI detector.\nPart of the solution to rampant academic dishonesty may also lie in expanding our vocabulary to discuss the issue, as John McWhorter pointed out in The New York Times. A class-wide cheating ring, direct plagiarism of original ideas from a paper as one\u2019s own, and copying a line of someone\u2019s code all constitute academic dishonesty, but range broadly in terms of severity and \u201cease of catching.\u201d However, this is rarely reflected in academic integrity policies.\u00a0\nIt can be awkward to suggest that some forms of dishonesty are worse than others, and more awkward still to draw the line between different punishments for different violations, but we must still have these conversations.\u00a0\nWhat should constitute dishonesty at all? When speaking with Jane, she would often circle back to how isolating it was to work alone on her assignments as a first year in introductory computer science courses, particularly as a woman in STEM. Every day, she would walk out of class \u201cfeeling way worse about [her]self.\u201d Now exploring chemistry, physics, and biology courses, she greatly appreciates the change in her academic environment, where students are encouraged to openly collaborate. The grade medians in chemistry are similar to those in CIS (which is to say, not great), but Jane is not as stressed as she was in CIS 1210, since she studies with her friends, and they can struggle and ask for help together.\u00a0\nWhile it was dishonest of Jane to copy code when it was against CIS 1210 policy, perhaps CIS majors and minors would learn more from the course if they were in a more collaborative environment to begin with. Jane has suggested that CIS 1210 should find a middle ground where students can learn from each other, but not be overly reliant on collaboration to perform well on exams.\u00a0\nShe also argues that there should be more opportunities for students to admit to academic dishonesty \u2014 through a friend at Stanford, she heard that at the end of a computer science class, students can select the assignments they have cheated on and receive a negative score on them, or risk facing more uncertain penalties if they are later caught.\u00a0\n\u201cThis policy gives people a second chance to do the right thing, and I do believe that you learn from an experience if you own up to it,\u201d Jane said.\nDeliberations over how best to address academic dishonesty can go on without end, but unfortunately this column must do just that. So here, I want to leave you with a reminder of what I said at the beginning: Academic dishonesty is unacceptable, but it is also understandable.\n\t\tGet our newsletter, DP Daybreak, delivered to your inbox every weekday morning.The hard, but necessary, solution to \u201ceveryone cheating\u201d is taking a good look at the stories behind academic dishonesty, and listening to the students involved with sympathy.

          "title": "Jack Lakis | What we can learn from Penn\u2019s college ranking",
          "article_content": "Last fall, a plethora of new results from U.S. News & World Report, Wall Street Journal, and Forbes elevated Penn in their national college rankings. Nearly every list places Penn among the top 10, some going as far as placing the University among the top five. This universal growth resulted from a key change in most of these sources\u2019 metrics: greater consideration given to postgraduate salaries.\nPenn famously has one of the highest-earning alumni bodies in the country. Starting salaries for Penn graduates are often considered the highest in the Ivy League. By mid-career, the average Penn alum is raking in $165,000 annually, while the national average for a college graduate caps out at $74,000.\n\t\tPenn draws a great deal of prestige from its potential to produce high earners, which is a direct result of our school\u2019s preprofessional culture. Nearly 50% of all Penn graduates enter one of two career fields: consulting or finance. This pipeline allows most Penn alumni to matriculate into high-paying jobs shortly after graduation.\nI\u2019m usually a defender of preprofessionalism. It\u2019s crucial that Penn graduates are able to find good jobs, and high salary potential is an immense advantage. But those jobs aren\u2019t everything. Many universities are making gains in rankings and name recognition based on alumni outcomes in public service careers.\n\t\t\t\t\ufeffSEE MORE FROM JACK LAKIS:\ufeffDo we all hate Penn?Staying focused after Magill's resignation\ufeffFor example, Harvard University boasts about its eight presidential alumni. However, when 1968 Wharton graduate Donald Trump was elected president, Penn mostly ignored his history with the school. Given his proximity to controversy and his unconventional political history, Penn\u2019s bump in prestige was limited by Trump\u2019s election. Our second closest claim to the White House is the University\u2019s relationship with President Joe Biden and the opening of the Penn Biden Center. I argue that this is as far as Penn\u2019s ties to the presidency will go. Nowadays, Penn\u2019s laser focus on professional development might repel students who will one day have presidential potential.\nComparable institutions to Penn have high-earning graduates and prestigious placements throughout the government, nonprofit sector, and the advocacy space. For example, Georgetown University feeds graduates into congressional offices and many Fulbright programs. Princeton University also regularly features its flashy roster of graduates in powerful political offices. These universities maintain a strong presence in the private sector but are also actively represented in government positions.\n\tIn these examples, the institution itself sponsors an undergraduate school dedicated to public service. At Georgetown, it\u2019s the School of Foreign Service, while at Princeton the role is filled by the School of Public and International Affairs.\nI propose that Penn follow suit and create a fifth undergraduate school dedicated to public affairs. This new school could absorb Penn\u2019s wildly popular social science programs, like PPE (Philosophy, Politics and Economics), Political Science, and Economics. Currently, most students in these majors are scooped up by consulting firms and investment banks. If these students were given an intentional focus on service and social responsibility, perhaps they could feel empowered to use their degrees in a more meaningful way.\nThe least Penn can do is expand its current effort to bridge the gap between social science degree seekers and careers in government and nonprofits. It\u2019s crucial that our student body actively engages with the robust policy infrastructure that Penn has already made available: Civic House, Perry World House, opportunities like Penn in Washington, and extracurricular engagements offered by the Government and Politics Association. From what I\u2019ve seen, these resources are underutilized at Penn. By snubbing them, Penn students are working against the general interests of the University to gain prestige.\n\t\tGet our newsletter, DP Daybreak, delivered to your inbox every weekday morning.Besides, it's about more than just rankings. We have the potential to empower our students to become leaders in society. TIME Magazine ranks Penn as the third-best college for aspiring leaders. However, the article states its rationale for this placement as a concentration of graduates in business careers. Other chart-topping schools on this list were noted for their programs in law, medicine, and more.\nUltimately, private sector homogeneity marks one of Penn\u2019s key weaknesses. As we move forward, Penn has a duty to educate leaders in more than one field. If Penn strengthened its programs in civic engagement, more graduates would be inclined to pursue roles in government and could elevate Penn\u2019s cultural stature. We should be known for more than salaries. We can do more than business.\nJACK LAKIS is a College first year studying political science from Kennesaw, Ga.

          "title": "Mia Vesely | Black Penn is vibrant this month and every month",
          "article_content": "As of late, most of my columns have focused on things I take issue with: Whether it\u2019s Liz Magill\u2019s resignation and the threats to free speech on campus, or the lack of racial diversity in Panhellenic sororities. I haven't highlighted the things that I truly appreciate and, more specifically, the places in which I\u2019ve found community at Penn.\nLast February, I argued that Black history is important for everyone. Education surrounding Black people, their lives, and their contributions should be integrated into the standard curriculum. Black Penn shows up and shows out every month, but this month in particular, there are many events and ways that Penn student organizations uplift the community and come together.\u00a0\n\t\tIt would be impossible to touch on all of these amazing events and their impacts, but I\u2019d like to paint a picture of some of these groups and their initiatives during this month and beyond. Planning for these events takes months. For example, when Descendants of Afro-Americans at Penn (DAAP) \u2014 a club founded just last year \u2014 put on their first-ever gala on Feb. 1 to kick off the month, you better believe that the event was well-planned and executed.\u00a0\nThe gala \u2014 Red Carpet For A Cause \u2014 supported the Sickle Cell Disease Association of America's Philadelphia and Delaware Valley Chapter. The night included catered food, live performances from student groups like The Inspiration, wonderful community, and beautiful decor\u2014even including an ice sculpture of the DAAP logo. Over $1,700 was raised in support of the foundation.\n\t\t\t\tSEE MORE FROM MIA VESELY:\ufeffI dropped sorority rush and I\u2019m gladFirst Liz Magill, next free speechWhen asked about the impacts of the event, College sophomore and DAAP founding member Clarke Dickens said, \u201cWe wanted to bring the community together for a great cause, especially a cause that affects a lot of African Americans and Black people more broadly.\u201d\nSickle cell disease occurs in about one in every 365 Black babies born in the United States. The percentage of Black people who carry the trait is even higher, with one in 13 Black babies being born as carriers.\n\tDickens is not just involved with DAAP, but is also on the boards for QBlack and Shea Collective.\nThese clubs are all part of something commonly dubbed \u201cBlack Penn,\u201d which focuses on so many different aspects of identity. From cultural organizations like Penn African Student Association (PASA), to preprofessional organizations like Black Wharton and the Black Pre-Law Association (BPLA), to community service organizations like the NAACP, all of these organizations put an emphasis on service both inside the Penn community and out.\u00a0\nFor example, Campus Curlz \u2014 a club I serve on the board of \u2014 is, at first glance, a club centered around uplifting natural hair and embracing positivity. \u00a0But underlying hair mask making events and movie nights, there is a strong commitment to service. Just this month, the community service committee held an event where we made Valentine\u2019s Day cards for senior citizens at Mercy Life West Philadelphia.\nService by board members is a requirement to be part of funding organizations like UMOJA \u2014 the umbrella funding organization for Black clubs \u2014 and even beyond that, many clubs center service in every activity they partake in. Whether you\u2019re on the board of a club or not, there are many service opportunities available and encouraged.\nWhen asked what they wish people knew about Black Penn, Dickens said, \u201cClubs should make an effort to include grad students, it makes all the difference. I\u2019m able to say, \u2018This is what I would look like coming here for grad school,\u2019 and it can even offer opportunities for mentorship.\u201d\nWhat seems to drive Black Penn is first and foremost the students, then the supportive and involved faculty, as well as the local partnerships and opportunities the clubs find, build, and pursue for themselves. Many members of the DAAP board are native to Philadelphia, so that makes their work even more personal.\nWhile Black students do take initiative to realize what they need and create the spaces they want to see, there is so much room for improvement on behalf of Penn: whether it\u2019s stratifying the way funding is given to these clubs \u2014 they often can\u2019t fund silverware in UMOJA meetings if it can be provided elsewhere \u2014 or improving the cultural spaces available to students (we were promised the ARCH \u2018building,\u2019 not the ARCH \u2018basement\u2019). In months like February, Penn aims to spotlight their Black students. I just wish this recognition of the incredible community Black students forged for themselves, when they initially didn\u2019t see it on campus, came year-round.\n\t\tGet our newsletter, DP Daybreak, delivered to your inbox every weekday morning.Events like DAAP's gala happen every month, and it\u2019s important not to understate the role these organizations play in making Penn a welcoming and accepting place for students from marginalized backgrounds.\nI was happy to see Faces of Black Penn \u2014 a Black-run publication \u2014 highlighted in the DP last week. I hope people continue to uplift the work of these student groups going forward and make space to give all students their roses.

          "title": "Bernadine Kumi | I joined a sorority and I\u2019m glad",
          "article_content": "I\u2019ll be honest: I was not a fan of Greek life when I first got to Penn. My perception of Greek life was influenced by growing up in the South, mainly in suburban Georgia. This included a sorority scene of girls with fake spray tans and little to no personality. The images of sorority girls from the University of Georgia and Alabama screamed no diversity, which made me wary of joining a sorority at Penn. Being a First-Generation, Low-Income (FGLI) student made me especially hesitant. Even more so, coming from a Ghanaian household, the notion of a sorority was immediately dismissed as something against our Christian values. Thus, during my first year, I knew I would never, and I mean never, join a sorority.\u00a0\nHowever, by the beginning of sophomore year, my mindset began to change. After a year on campus, I had found a solid community of a small group of friends. But beyond that, I felt that I did not really know anyone. I couldn\u2019t name more than 20 people in my grade. Penn is known for being a networking school, and the \u201cSocial Ivy,\u201d so I began to question just how much I had taken advantage of that. That, along with most of the underclassmen party scene revolving around fraternities, made the idea of rushing even more appealing.\u00a0\n\t\tSo while most people were beginning their sophomore year with the friends they already had, I began to look for additional friends. My twin sister, who also goes to Penn, and I began attending open rush events, talking to sophomores in sororities, and involving ourselves in more social events. Over the next few months, my days consisted of talking to many girls, going to dinners, and putting myself out there in a way that I had been hesitant to do before. I made new friends, met fellow sophomores also in search of a bigger community, and found myself loving the idea of joining a sorority.\u00a0\nBut what made me even more eager was just how inclusive and diverse sororities were at Penn, more so than I had been expecting\u2014especially the off-campus sorority I ended up joining, OAX. I was still wary about rushing, but as soon as I got to the first event, I immediately felt comfortable. There were girls with different interests, passions, economic backgrounds, and personalities. Not a single conversation felt forced. Every girl I met had a unique and authentic story, and I felt like I could talk to them for hours.\n\t\t\t\tSEE MORE FROM BERNADINE KUMI:\ufeffDining hall workers at Penn Hillel demand better treatment from UniversityI was especially captivated by BLOAX (Black OAX), a community within OAX that includes fellow girls of Ghanaian descent and other Black girls who provided me with guidance on navigating Penn as a Black woman. OAX also has other smaller communities, such as LatinOAX and RainbOAX. Being able to find other people with similar backgrounds made the choice to join a sorority that much easier.\u00a0\nAs a FGLI student and Questbridge scholar, the idea of paying high dues out of my minimal work paychecks every month was unfathomable. I knew that joining a sorority would pose another financial burden, and even though I was loving the OAX community, the idea of paying dues scared me. Yet once again, OAX and other sororities surprised me with their understanding and financial transparency. They worked with me to develop an affordable monthly payment plan so that I, like every other girl interested in rushing, could also enjoy being in a sorority.\u00a0\n\tSince the morning of Bid Day when I got \u201cthe call,\u201d I know that I truly made the right decision by joining a sorority, for not only my social life but my professional life too. This past fall, I was able to land a summer internship in Los Angeles with the help of my grand-big. I was also able to prepare for my interview with girls in my sorority, who gave me the confidence I needed to land the opportunity. As a Black woman and FGLI student, I have truly benefited from joining Greek life. I hope students who are hesitant to rush, just as I once was, will see my experience and how transformative it can be. I hope others \u2014 whether they are Black women, FGLI students, or just Penn students in search of a greater community \u2014 can do the same.\nBERNADINE KUMI is a College junior studying political science and legal studies and history from Roswell, Ga.

          "article_content": "Columnist Jessey Shin explores the problem of disparate advising quality in the College and argues \nfor a more standardized experience.\u201cMy advisor lied to me?\u201d\nI remember someone saying this to me in complete disbelief, but I can\u2019t say I\u2019m surprised. Advisors can be as misleading as they are helpful, and this is a widespread problem that needs addressing.\n\t\tIn the College, students typically have between 15 and 20 credits outside of their primary major to meet the graduation requirement. These are used to fulfill general education requirements, pursue a second major or minor, or take elective courses that align with a student\u2019s interests.\nThe freedom to pursue one\u2019s intellectual pursuits is, of course, one of the draws of the College. I am looking to pursue two majors myself, in somewhat interconnected but disparate fields of study: the flexibility offered by the curriculum allows me to explore these interests without taking an obscene number of classes.\n\t\t\t\tSEE MORE FROM JESSEY SHIN:Making a case for the less popular college housesNavigating the maze of Penn's resources\ufeffThe problem is few students go into their first year knowing which major they would like to pursue, much less exactly which courses to take.\u00a0\nThe College puts a lot of effort into informing incoming students about the curriculum and what they have to offer, such as through the Compass module on Canvas that gives a foray into some aspects of the College experience (something that other schools do not offer). However, the sheer number of options can be overwhelming, giving rise to a unique need for personalized, one-on-one guidance. This is where pre-major advisors come in.\u00a0\n\tPre-major advisors, assigned to each student before they start their first semester at Penn, are a vital resource for College students. They guide students through the course selection process, encouraging and helping them as they explore their various interests and eventually settle on a major.\nI can say that I have had a relatively good experience with my pre-major advisor. However, I also found that some of the advice offered was not fully applicable to my circumstance, because of the recent transition from Penn InTouch to Path@Penn.\nOther students, however, are not as lucky. I have heard stories about advisors making their students cry, spreading misinformation, jeopardizing their advisees\u2019 course registration, you name it.\nIn an interview, one student (who requested anonymity) shared that they have had trouble reaching their pre-major advisor from the get-go. College students must meet with their advisor one-on-one to get their course registration hold lifted; without this, they are not eligible to participate in advance registration. The student was only able to reach their advisor a day or so before the deadline and has continued to have trouble with availability.\nOf course, their pre-major advisor experience was less than ideal. \u201cHer guidance wasn\u2019t so much guidance as it was looking at the boxes and seeing if I checked them,\u201d they said. \u201cI don\u2019t think I would feel comfortable going to her for personal issues, such as which major to pursue or how to explore [some of my interests], because I don\u2019t think she would point me [in] the right direction.\u201d Instead, they had been utilizing their PennCAP advisor (available for FGLI students) for these concerns.\nOn the other hand, some students are able to form a positive relationship with their advisor and find that they are helpful in navigating their interests. Rishi Dadlani, a College first year, described his advisor as \u201cfriendly and helpful. He gave me his phone number and told me to contact him if I [had] any questions \u2026 If I saw him around campus, I would say hi, and he always sends us a beginning-of-semester email.\u201d\n\t\tGet our newsletter, DP Daybreak, delivered to your inbox every weekday morning.This disparity in advising quality means that some students are at a great disadvantage compared to others. While some advisors are able to \u201cpoint students in the right direction,\u201d helping them take the right step forward in their college experience, others fall short. Their advisees must navigate the complicated process of learning about the majors, gen-ed requirements, and figuring out (the surprisingly difficult) advance registration process on their own.\nWhen done right, the freedom of the College curriculum can allow students to truly delve into their academic interests and eventually settle on the right path for them. However, that process requires a lot of research and planning that is supposed to be aided by a pre-major advisor. For incoming first years who are unfamiliar with the landscape at Penn and underclassmen students, this disparity in advising quality poses a challenge. Penn must ensure that all students are able to best utilize the resources at their disposal, and the first place to start is with the guidance they receive.\nJESSEY SHIN is a College first-year studying sociology and communications from Seongnam-si, South Korea.

          "article_content": "Guest Columnist Raheem Williams recommends three books for the Penn community to engage with this Black History Month.Dear Fellow Quakers,\nAs we celebrate Black History Month, it's crucial to recognize the multifaceted nature of the Black American experience. This month offers an opportunity to delve into the depths of history: exploring narratives that challenge, inspire, and provoke thought. In the spirit of true academic inquiry and in honor of this significant month, I wish to highlight a selection of works by Black authors whose perspectives might diverge from the more commonly embraced interpretations of Black history and culture.\n\t\tIn recommending these texts, my intention is not to endorse every opinion expressed by the authors, but to underscore the importance of engaging with a diversity of viewpoints. These authors challenge us to look beyond the prevailing orthodoxy and to question the narratives that have become commonplace within academic circles. They remind us that the Black American experience, like any aspect of human history, is richly diverse and complex.\nAs members of an academic community that prides itself on intellectual rigor and openness, it is our responsibility to explore a broad spectrum of perspectives, especially those that provoke debate and reflection. Let us take this Black History Month as an opportunity to broaden our horizons, engage with ideas that challenge us, and appreciate the rich tapestry of narratives that comprise Black history in America.\n\t\t\t\tRAHEEM WILLIAMS is an Executive MPA student at the Fels Institute of Government and a member of the Committee on Open Expression.

          "title": "Jessey Shin | Register NOW, submit by EOD: Seriously, what\u2019s the rush?",
          "article_content": "\u201cIf I don\u2019t get an internship this summer,\u201d I hear someone say on Locust, \u201cI\u2019ll be so far behind. Some people are already recruiting for next summer.\u201d\nOn Canvas, I finally receive the prompt for a reading response that I need to submit in 36 hours. An email notification pops up: It begins with the all-too-familiar \u201cURGENT\u201d and \u201cACTION REQUIRED,\u201d but this, too, will ultimately be buried in my inbox for a good few days until I have the time to go through it. Over time, I began to question the sense of urgency that dominates Penn\u2019s campus, and whether it\u2019s doing more harm than good.\n\t\tThis isn\u2019t a problem exclusive to me. One of my friends has over 10,000 unread emails in her inbox from various departments and clubs with which she is no longer associated. Every so often, I will hear professors and teaching assistants suggest that students start their assignments earlier, and that a significant portion of work was turned in late. At the other end of the classroom, I hear conversations about just how behind and sleep-deprived everyone is amid the barrage of midterms, club interviews, rushing, and job applications.\nIn \u201cConjectures of a Guilty Bystander,\u201d Thomas Merton say, \u201cThe rush and pressure of modern life are a form, perhaps the most common form, of its innate violence. To allow oneself to be carried away by a multitude of conflicting concerns, to surrender to too many demands, to commit oneself to too many projects, to want to help everyone in everything, is to succumb to violence.\u201d\u00a0\n\t\t\t\tSEE MORE FROM JESSEY SHIN:\u201cWhy is your pre-major advisor so much better than mine?\u201dDear Penn, your scooters are mobility aids (sort of)\ufeffAs the overcommitted, overworked high school students we once were, Penn students are intimately familiar with this sense of urgency and obligation. There\u2019s so much to do, always, and these impending tasks are completed at the expense of sleep, rest, and recreation. Instead of attributing this lack of work-life balance to poor time management skills or the need for prioritization, I\u2019d like to suggest a different approach: Just how much of this is really urgent, anyway? How much of this is worth sacrificing our wellbeing over?\nWe labor under the illusion that even inconsequential things must be done immediately. If we miss the opportunity to apply for the position now, we\u2019re letting go of one of the \"greatest\" opportunities of our lives. Not responding to emails in a timely manner is the sign of someone who\u2019s \u201clazy\u201d and \u201cunreliable.\u201d This is perpetuated in our classrooms as well: \u201cMakeups will only be given under extraordinary and documented circumstances.\u201d \u201cEven habitual excused absences will negatively impact your grade.\u201d\n\tI firmly believe that academia, especially institutions like Penn, should be a space for fostering growth and intellectual conversations. How is this achievable, I wonder, if we don\u2019t recognize and accommodate the very real struggles that anyone can come across? Surely, no one wants to experience a death in the family during finals season, but sometimes those are the cards we are dealt. What happens then? Do our deadlines take precedence over our health and our loved ones?\nThe implications of these sentiments can be sinister. They tell us that it is not important to take care of our bodies, listen to our needs, and live in accordance with what is most meaningful to us. Bombarded by constant deadlines, we are pushed to perform day in and day out with no space to reflect and connect with the lofty ambitions we initially came here with.\nWe have the power to reimagine academia \u2014 spaces like Penn are saturated with people who are dedicated to learning, contributing to social change, and becoming an integral part of our communities. However, taking advantage of this also means that everyone needs the time to explore and see their ideas through. Taking a step back from the one-time-only events and assignments piling up on our to-do lists, we are able to devote more resources to our goals and begin to manage our tasks instead of our tasks managing us.\nI truly applaud Penn students for their commitment to success and achievement; however, I would like us to pause and reflect on what we would like to achieve. The narrative of urgency written into our deadlines can motivate us to go further, but it can also disempower us, clouding our ability to take charge of our lives.\nJESSEY SHIN is a College first year studying sociology and communications from Seongnam-si, South Korea.

          "title": "Franklin Li | Just another article on Penn Dining",
          "article_content": "Not a single person on campus seems to be satisfied with Penn Dining. Over the past month, The Daily Pennsylvanian published several pieces that express dissatisfaction. They highlight four problems.\nThe first problem is sanitary issues. Students have reported finding a cockroach, maggot, and glass in their food. It is also no secret that last year, Penn\u2019s dining halls received a total of 100 health code violations, with Hill House and 1920 Commons being outright noncompliant with the general standards set by Philadelphia\u2019s Department of Health.\n\t\tThe second problem is the taste of the food. I acknowledge that taste is a very subjective matter. But when we would rather line up at food trucks on 38th and Spruce streets than eat at dining halls and have several dozens of unused swipes at the end of semester, something must be wrong.\nThe third problem is the food being too pricey. A small box with nine pieces of sushi or two normal-sized buns from the cafe at McClelland costs one swipe, which is equivalent to at least $10, depending on the dining plan. Penn admitted that eating off campus costs less than it does on campus, and some expressed that it is difficult to feel full living only on the dining plan.\n\t\t\t\tSEE MORE FROM FRANKLIN LI:Rethinking College sector requirementsWhy awarding a posthumous diploma to architect Lin Huiyin is important\ufeffThe fourth problem is the limited operating hours of dining halls. On regular weekdays, though they do not give us 7:30 a.m. to 12 a.m. dining hall access like some schools do, the hours cover most of the normal eating times. Choices become more limited during weekends and over breaks. Brunch opens at 9 a.m. on weekends and is only provided at Hill House and Commons. Over spring break, Hill House was the only non-retail dining hall that opened.\nThe problems are clear and simple. But after years of complaints, nothing has changed (well, except for the annual increase in meal plan prices). And I believe nothing will change in the near future \u2014 no truly viable solution exists to Penn\u2019s dining hall dissatisfaction.\n\tWhat are some practical solutions to address dining hall problems? Eliminating the dining plan requirement for first-year and sophomore students would definitely be one. When students do not need to pay Penn a lump sum at the start of the semester, their decision on where to eat will be purely based on taste and price. If Penn Dining makes no improvements, students will either eat out or cook on their own, and dining hall revenues will tumble.\nAnother possibility is to have two or more food contractors. Competition gives the dining halls an incentive to improve their food quality and lower prices to attract students. If they do not, again, they will face revenue contraction. Essentially, the more affordable choices students have, the better Penn\u2019s dining services will be.\nBut none of these changes will probably ever happen. No school administrator would want to cut the flow of profit from dining plans. No food contractor would sign a contract with Penn knowing that it faces competition from another food contractor. And why would Penn double the cost of food contractors? There is no financial rationale for improving students\u2019 dining experience, and no matter how many more articles we write on \u201cPenn should improve its dining services,\u201d we still have to wake up the next morning and use our swipes.\nSo will we be forever stuck with Penn\u2019s unsatisfactory dining halls, at least for the first two years? Unfortunately, I would say yes. Unless we are willing to pay for the meal plans but not eat at dining halls, or we actually find Penn\u2019s dining satisfactory, we will need to look forward to life as an upperclassman.\nFRANKLIN LI is a College first year from Beijing, China.

          "title": "Sose Hovannisian | A love letter to Philadelphia",
          "article_content": "Upon my acceptance to Penn a couple of years back, I was overwhelmed by an abundance of snooty comments and remarks relating to the city of Philadelphia, sentiments I could not visualize or understand. \u201cHave fun in Filthadelphia!\u201d or \u201cDon\u2019t get shot!\u201d often followed the congrats I received from most people. Not having had a proper vision of Philadelphia\u2019s layout or culture, I soon fell victim to my peers' alarming warnings and became rather cautious and overly attentive in my first weeks as a Quaker. Of course, the University alerts about various armed robberies or the occasional escaped prisoner did not help this berated city\u2019s case.\nWhile Philadelphia does have its safety hazards and concerning instances, I\u2019ve learned that just may be the price of living in a big city \u2014 the sixth biggest in the nation, in fact. Not to fluff up the real and present dangers, but it also should be said that Philadelphia is not much more dangerous than living in San Francisco, Chicago, or Miami, all of which are regarded as highly attractive places to live.\u00a0\n\t\tMany Penn students, coming from places of privilege and very comfortable livelihoods, are quick to harp on and nitpick at Philadelphia\u2019s imperfections. Jokes are constantly made about living in Philadelphia, comparing it to a punishment or drag. Most students are eager to move out, with their eyes set on New York City or Washington D.C., completely blind to the bevy of opportunities offered right here in Philadelphia. What many Penn students seem to overlook is the fact that Philadelphia is an esteemed, bustling, and charming city that many people dream of moving to and working in. Sure, Philadelphia is no tropical paradise, but it serves its purpose as a solid, spiffing city with so much to offer.\u00a0\nSo, instead of joining my peers in badgering on the City of Brotherly Love, I\u2019d like to take this time to highlight the best parts about living in Philadelphia, and hopefully convince you that we are extremely lucky to be going to school in such a vibrant and lively city.\u00a0\n\t\t\t\tSEE MORE FROM SOSE HOVANNISIAN:Penn students deserve more time off from their corporate-style academic calendarsThe pedagogic power of InstagramThe first thing that comes to mind when family or friends ask what I love about Philadelphia is, more often than not, the incredible food scene. Almost every restaurant, cafe, and quick lunch spot I have tried has wowed me, and I\u2019d like to say that that\u2019s a lot coming from a Los Angeles native! Just last year, Philadelphia won four titles in the James Beard Awards, whose prestige can be compared to \u201cthe Oscars, but for food.\u201d Beyond the bevy of choices we have near campus in University City, there are countless hidden gems and highly acclaimed restaurants in Rittenhouse, Fishtown, Northern Liberties, Manayunk, and more. Philadelphia is known for its diversity, and its countless cuisines are here to prove it. \u00a0\nPhiladelphia\u2019s finest cheesesteaks and soft pretzels are great, and they\u2019re best when eaten in the stands of one of the city\u2019s stadiums. Philadelphians beam with pride every time the Phillies, Eagles, Flyers, and 76ers play. Living in a city with this much athletic pride is not only great for our college experience, but it\u2019s also just a good time. Being able to go to these games, engage in the city\u2019s love for the teams, and enjoy city-wide celebrations is something we\u2019re very lucky to have at Penn, where school-wide athletic spirit is low.\u00a0\n\tEven if you\u2019re not one to appreciate sports, you can easily be one to appreciate Philadelphia\u2019s teams in a different way, perhaps by admiring one of the big Phillies murals on the Walnut Street walk to Center City. Philadelphia\u2019s streets are decorated with many murals and public art, coloring the city and demonstrating civic engagement through the expressions of many local artists. What\u2019s more, Philadelphia also offers many outlets to enjoy fine arts, whether it's through a day spent at the Philadelphia Museum of Art or a night at one of its many popular jazz clubs. Last year, Philadelphia was named the Public Art Capital of America, and the Best City in America for Street Art. And to top these accolades, Philadelphia is constantly celebrated for its memorialized history.\nNamed the Nation's First World Heritage City, Philadelphia is also known as the birthplace of the United States. In a city with a history so rich, every building, street, and alleyway has a story worth telling. Independence Hall, Benjamin Franklin, and the Liberty Bell all make this city the perfect historical backdrop for college students, offering countless opportunities to engage with the legacy of this country\u2019s founding fathers and their work. In particular, Philadelphia\u2019s long history of Black trials and tribulations is a key feature of the city\u2019s development. What\u2019s more, Philadelphia has grown into an unbelievably diverse city, boasting a great range of racial, socioeconomic, cultural, sexual, and religious representation. \u00a0\nWhile I have only touched upon some of the things that make Philadelphia so great, every Penn student has the opportunity to explore this big city and discover its many wonders for themselves. Penn\u2019s location, being right across the bridge from Center City, gives all able students the opportunity to just take a brisk walk out of the Penn Bubble and enter a realm of possibilities, opportunities, and new experiences. And for those of you who would rather not get on your feet, the city can just as easily be explored with the comprehensive and convenient SEPTA system.\u00a0\nI call on each and every one of you to take a moment the next time you\u2019re about to bash Philadelphia and consider the validity of what you\u2019re about to say, while also acknowledging our privilege of being here. Learn to love this city, for we know it loves you!\nSOSE HOVANNISIAN is a College sophomore majoring in communications and minoring in history and consumer psychology from Los Angeles, Calif.

          "article_content": "I support the use of ChatGPT.\nA statement that, said aloud, would garner me sidelong stares despite the website\u2019s appearance in many lecture halls.\n\t\tThe use of ChatGPT has raised much debate among students and become a topic of considerable contention. Similarly, many professors hold polarizing views, as the use of generative AI has been harshly rejected in some classrooms while others have tentative policies supporting its usage. The limitation of emerging technology in educational spaces should raise alarm bells, as we are rejecting tools that could be invaluable for facilitating learning. \u00a0\nTo be clear, I am against academic dishonesty, and I haven\u2019t used ChatGPT in a duplicitous manner. However, saying that ChatGPT is synonymous with academic misconduct is a remarkably weighty statement. I do assent that some individuals could use ChatGPT in an academically dishonest way, such as employing it to write papers in their stead. But, a similar result could be accomplished via other online tools, like Google. Just recently, we have become privy to accusations of plagiarism by former Harvard President Claudine Gay, revealing how this is not solely a ChatGPT issue. Thus, our viewpoint of the perpetrator should be reframed, delegating the fault to the person, not the tool.\n\t\t\n\t\nWith the release of GPT-4, many professors and students alike need to reconsider its benefits. Professors already recommend YouTube for content help, so why not ChatGPT?\nChatGPT can be a remarkable asset that provides an advantage to disadvantaged students. Since many Penn students come into university with a deep background in their chosen field of study, which they gained from their access to prep schools or private tutors, the bridge between these two groups is substantial. ChatGPT provides a way to somewhat balance the playing field.\n\tFor one, GPT-4\u2019s added feature of uploading PDFs makes it ridiculously simple to ask questions about lecture content, at any time of the day, while tailoring it to your level of understanding, a skill that many professors and teaching assistants lack. As several professors are utterly immersed in their fields and many TAs have an intuitive grasp of the subject, they are often incapable of making complex topics digestible. Unfortunately, there have been many instances where I gave up on asking questions to avoid receiving a convoluted response.\u00a0\nWith ChatGPT, feedback is immediate, allowing students to reflect on areas of improvement in their work, and providing them with mechanisms to improve over time. Why go through the hassle of setting up TA office hours to ask a simple question when ChatGPT can do it instantaneously?\u00a0\nStudents outside of Penn who do not have access to an educational institution with tutoring facilities also stand to attain so much from receiving academic help from ChatGPT. This is due to its similarity to using online services like Khan Academy, though ChatGPT is much more personalized.\nProfessors who reject the idea of incorporating ChatGPT into classrooms have not considered thinking critically of its beneficial uses. Instead, they are content with adhering to traditional practices, foregoing innovation for comfort. On the other hand, students who are against the usage of AI hold themselves to a higher standard for not relying on outside sources \u2014 similar to many Penn students' views of receiving academic help through services like Weingarten tutoring or office hours. For many, receiving outside help is equated to a lack of intelligence. As with the many Penn students of privileged backgrounds, they do not require additional help and thus look down on disadvantaged students who do require these services.\u00a0\n\t\tGet our newsletter, DP Daybreak, delivered to your inbox every weekday morning.In the end, humans are meant to be adaptable and always have been. Rejecting technological advancements accomplishes nothing; rather, it is actively harmful to many students who lose out on such a beneficial tool.\nWith that said, we should all sit to reflect on the valuable uses of ChatGPT.\nKAYNATH CHOWDHURY is a College sophomore studying political science and computer science from Detroit, Mich.

          "title": "Francesco Salamone | Let\u2019s talk about dying!",
          "article_content": "\u201cWhat do your parents do?\u201d someone seriously asked me during Wharton orientation. Fighting my brain's battle between an unforced desire to share and an aversion to the anticipated awkward look, I recognized that I would face a long, interminable moment of apnea trying to explain to the world that I do not have two parents because my dad died. Grief exists, and at Penn, it isolates.\nTo be clear, I do not intend to be a prophet speaking universal truths because loss looks different for everyone, but I hope you will find truth in my words nonetheless. Death is a sensitive topic, not the least because it intertwines with cultural, religious, spiritual, and socioeconomic aspects of our identity. Yet grief is undeniably omnipresent, and Penn is no exception, meaning I am not the first one to write (or talk) about it, nor will I be the last, unfortunately.\n\t\tAlmost 40% of college students have lost a family member or close friend within the last two years. Considering there are 18.58 million college students, that makes us more than 7 million grievers. I guess we are not a minority, are we?\u00a0\nWharton senior Pranavi Karnati lost her father last December after a battle with glioblastoma. She bravely watched him suffer for more than a year and a half, but \u201cdespite the pain he felt, he always managed to make us smile.\u201d She experienced a slower, anticipatory death and described her grief as \u201cisolating.\u201d\n\t\t\t\tSEE MORE FROM FRANCESCO SALAMONE: \ufeffIs Penn about liberal arts or elite jobs?There is no definitively designated place to grieve at Penn. Yes, Student Health and Counseling helps (if you are lucky), but 61% of college counselors in the United States report feeling \u201csomewhat, little, or not comfortable at all\u201d with supporting students primarily on grief. Unlike peer institutions like Princeton that offer grief-focused support groups, Penn lacks such infrastructure. The only comparable program that existed was Actively Move Forward, but it has been inactive since 2019.\nWhat about Philadelphia-based groups? As Karnati shared, before you even get a chance to talk about grief, you may face an identity crisis. \u201cThere are groups for children and groups for adults. What am I? Where are college students supposed to sign up?\u201d\n\tThe result explains why grief feels isolating. Naturally, some prefer to process on their own, but sooner or later, we crave feeling less like an alien and more like we are not the only ones experiencing excruciating pain. And support groups are one easy way to find others who relate.\nOf course, this is only half the problem. Remember, I believe Penn is a detached elite. Having two parents is a privilege: emotionally but interestingly also economically, and substantially so. I cannot blame you for having a privilege you did not choose, but I can and will invite you to reflect on it.\u00a0\nAfter Karnati posted her terrible news, she received several supportive messages: \u201cLmk if you need anything\u201d stood out. She mentioned, \u201cMy loss is making me realize who my true friends really are.\u201d\u00a0\nCan Penn students only support one another through hasty texts with cheap acronyms?\nWe know your \u201cI\u2019m here if you need me\u201d is well-intentioned, but understand that it creates a dilemma by putting the onus of starting the conversation on us, inadvertently burdening the griever even more. The individualistically expeditious culture of Penn is inevitably in direct contrast to the prolonged nonlinear path that grievers experience. At best, Penn students are awkwardly unequipped to support a grieving friend and at worst, fundamentally incapable of slowing down to care and empathize. You can do better.\nLike what? Be present with your friend\u2019s pain, listen with the heart, respect disordered confusion, and discover the gifts of sacred silence over filling words. That is what grief counselor Dr. Alan Wolfelt calls companioning. I wish my friends knew about companionship to ask me about my dad. Ask me what he was like, what he liked to do, what his quirks were. God, just ask me what his name was. When you ask, you are not reminding me that he died (trust me, I know), you are letting me know that you acknowledge that he lived.\nThe truth is I cannot blame them. Part of the matter is institutional and part of it is cultural: Many of us are used to the high school familiarity of knowing at least some family members of our friends. For better or for worse, in college, you are nothing more to others than what you present. And unlike your Canada Goose, you cannot wear your invisible grief when you walk down Locust. What you can wear is a Penn Face and pretend no one died, even with your closest friends, because it is profoundly easier and more tempting than the unfathomable truth.\nSo please, I beg you, next time you come across a griever, think twice before ending the conversation out of discomfort or sending the \u201cI\u2019m here if you need me\u201d text. Think beyond and think deeper. Perhaps take the simplest approach: Sit down with them and see where they will bring you.\n\t\tGet our newsletter, DP Daybreak, delivered to your inbox every weekday morning.If we collectively accept death as a mainstream topic of social dialogue, grief will be easier to handle than to hide. Harvard professor and happiness expert Arthur Brooks says: \u201cGrief does not have to be a private misery and net harm to our lives. We can learn to comprehend it, manage it, and grow from it. And in understanding our own grief, we can help others heal and thrive as well.\u201d\nAfter seven years, I understand my grief, and it is my hope (and Karnati\u2019s recent hope) that these words will help somebody.\nFRANCESCO SALAMONE is a Wharton sophomore from Palermo, Italy.

          "article_content": "This semester, I somehow ended up with four out of my five classes being either directly or indirectly about ethics. As a political science major, I was really excited to take these classes, since whenever people talk about ethics nowadays, it mostly has to do with politics or international relations.\nAt a time when our reality changes so rapidly because of technology, and when we are faced with a number of global challenges, some people have forgotten about the importance of acting morally. Especially at a place like Penn, where everyone seems to be extremely worried about their future and their careers, people often disregard these values when they are caught up by the competitive environment. Because of this, one would think that ethics classes would be extremely beneficial for all, but do they actually contribute to making students more ethical individuals?\n\t\tAccording to my professors, they don\u2019t.\nIn all four ethics classes, my professors started the semester by telling us that ethics classes will not make most of us more ethical. I sat there, listening to all of them, and I just could not understand why they would say something like that. If I wasn\u2019t going to learn anything, what was the point of taking these classes?\n\t\t\t\tSEE MORE FROM ZARA TENA:The urgent need for younger voices in politics\ufeffIt\u2019s okay to be ordinaryThat\u2019s where I was wrong: I have been learning a lot. While perhaps the main goal of ethics classes is not to turn students into more ethical people, they definitely give us the tools we need to critically engage with ethical dilemmas. By taking these classes, I might not become a better person, but they have given me a space where I can explore, discuss, and reflect about where I stand on so many issues and what my beliefs about morality actually are.\nEthics is not a subject that can be forcefully taught through lectures and readings. There is no way that we can sit down for three hours every week and magically become more ethical just because we memorize theories and read long papers written by old white men. The goal of these classes is not to tell us what is \u2018right\u2019 or \u2018wrong,\u2019 \u00a0but to give us the skills to navigate the gray areas in ethical decision making.\n\tThese classes encourage self reflection and personal growth. Even when analyzing big case studies or exploring different theories, students are pushed to question their own values, beliefs, and biases. While this may not guarantee that we will completely transform our moral compasses, the self awareness that comes from these reflections creates a great foundation for understanding why we act the way we do and also invites us to try to understand others.\nThe fact that ethics classes begin with a warning \u2014 that you won\u2019t become more ethical by taking them \u2014 should not stop anyone from giving them a chance. The ability to think critically, understand different values and perspectives, and have the skills to self reflect are essential parts of any college education. They prepare students for the complicated moral dilemmas they might face in their personal and professional lives \u2014 especially when most people at Penn will end up with jobs that are notorious for their ethical scandals!\nZARA TENA is a College sophomore studying political science from Puebla, Mexico.

Every get together begins to feel as if it requires intricate planning and strips away the simplicity of social connection. This routine becomes stifling, lacking spontaneity and authenticity; you\u2019re constrained to coordinating with the same faces in the same places.\u00a0\nThis is what I like to call scheduling fatigue.\u00a0\n\t\tAs a result of this phenomenon, gatherings among friends are beginning to resemble scheduled business meetings, meticulously arranged via tools like When2Meet or synchronized Google Calendars.\nWhile resorting to scheduling may seem like the only viable option to maintain a semblance of social connection, perhaps it's time to embrace the idea of venturing out solo: I\u2019m challenging you to go on an unplanned side quest all by yourself to a third place.\u00a0\n\t\t\t\tMORE FROM LALA MUSTAFA:A nation on defense: Dismantling misinformation against Azerbaijan in the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict\ufeff\ufeffAllow me to explain. Picture the first place as your home and the second as your place of education or work. Now, the third place emerges as a public sphere where individuals congregate, not out of any obligation like in the previously mentioned locations, but, for lack of a more precise term, to simply vibe. It could be the cozy corner of a cafe, a communal park, or even the neighborhood barbershop \u2014 anywhere that\u2019ll allow you to interact with people outside your usual circles.\u00a0\nYet, at many universities like Penn, the concept of a third place seems all but lost as our lives remain restricted to school grounds, causing even our first and second places to converge into one. While spots on campus \u2014 like Stommons, Pret, or the cultural centers in ARCH \u2014 can offer some respite, they often come with the latent pressure of being on the clock. Conversations here revolve around assignments, internships, and the intricacies of Penn culture. The chances of an unexpected encounter dwindle given that most people in attendance will be other Penn students. As we\u2019re cocooned in the Penn bubble, it comes as no surprise that many students spend their four years in Philadelphia without ever fully exploring it.\u00a0\n\tYet, this insulation comes at a cost that extends far beyond what we realize.\u00a0\nIt severs our connection not only from the outside world but also from ourselves. That is, within such limits, our individuality dwindles, reducing us to mere roles influenced by our peers. By excluding ourselves from a wider social sphere, we inhibit opportunities to engage with diverse perspectives, trap ourselves in a cycle of familiarity, and risk leading monotonous lives that pave the way to burnout.\nHowever, in our lives, both intimacy and affiliation with broader communities are essential. While intimacy often stems from our immediate circles, affiliation thrives in third places where spontaneous interactions occur. These spaces facilitate easy contact with new individuals on a regular basis, without the need for prior scheduling. As they consistently offer an opportunity for interaction with others, they end up cultivating the most reliable form of socialization.\u00a0\nSo, if you are keen on exploring new horizons and getting involved in the Philadelphia community, I suggest checking out the many informative articles dedicated to bursting the Penn bubble.\nNevertheless, I want to avoid confining third places to physical locations. They\u2019re more of a mindset, a willingness to embrace spontaneity wherever it may arise. They don't have to be far from campus or require spending money. Instead, third places can be any informal spots you visit \u2014 whether it's your student lounge, the library, or a community center.\u00a0\n\t\tGet our newsletter, DP Daybreak, delivered to your inbox every weekday morning.We often find ourselves caught up in the routines of daily life, clinging to familiar patterns of scheduling and social interaction.

          "title": "Beatriz B\u00e1ez | No closed captioning available",
          "article_content": "Columnist Beatriz B\u00e1ez explains her experience with language fatigue at Penn.On my first day at Penn, I called my father in distress, telling him I needed to move back home and study there as I was going to die alone at this university. My father asked why, and I quickly responded, \u201cI haven\u2019t met anybody in three hours. I have no friends. It\u2019s over for me.\u201d\u00a0\nThat very same night, I went to a New Student Orientation event at Houston Hall. As I nervously paced the floor in my Crocs, I overheard some students speaking Spanish and immediately gravitated toward them. Confessing, \u201cI heard Spanish, and I feel saved,\u201d I ended up meeting three genuine individuals, all from various parts of Latin America. Having arrived in the United States, it felt comforting to hear voices that reminded me of home. This comfort is priceless in such a foreign environment.\n\t\tAll my life, I\u2019ve taken courses in Spanish, spoken Spanish at home, and been berated by my grandmother whenever I spoke too much English. Arriving at Penn, I didn\u2019t anticipate the struggle I would face taking classes taught in English, as I had been lucky enough to have been extensively taught English from a very young age.\nBut speaking in a second language most of the time, even as a fluent speaker, is incredibly draining. Meeting native Spanish speakers at Penn was truly a blessing. However, I have found that some people react adversely to me speaking my primary language. These are not continuous reactions of a high degree, but there have been enough small instances to mark me.\u00a0\n\t\t\t\tMORE ON THIS TOPIC:Students celebrate 40th annual Festival Latinx, honoring Latinx culture on campusLa Casa Latina celebrates 2023 Latinx Heritage Month at PennOn various occasions, I have had Latinx friends say, \u201cLet\u2019s speak English so X person doesn\u2019t feel excluded,\u201d or even resort to English for \u201cconvenience\u201d when we\u2019re alone. For the former, I understand the sentiment. I wouldn\u2019t want someone to be excluded from a conversation in such a way. However, when I\u2019m naturally speaking Spanish, having my speech interpreted as a personal offense is off-putting.\u00a0\nIn one instance, I met a student through a mutual friend on a night out. This friend and I speak fluent Spanish; the person I had just met did not. Throughout the night, I had various conversations with my new acquaintance \u2014 who I found quite amicable \u2014 and my friend. I would naturally speak Spanish with the latter, not thinking much of it. The next morning, my friend told me how the new acquaintance felt I hated them for speaking Spanish in front of them, knowing they didn\u2019t speak the language.\u00a0\n\tI was shocked by the assumption and, in all honesty, a little offended. I found it quite conceited that one would think another person is speaking in their first language to actively exclude them. Speaking in a first language, for me, is purely a relief issue. Although I am fluent in English, after an entire week of speaking it, it can be extremely draining; thus, particularly in a social setting, I don\u2019t want to add to the exhaustion.\u00a0\nIt is more than fine to be curious about what somebody is saying and ask for a translation. However, immediately expressing discomfort upon hearing another language and presuming the other person is talking badly about you is inconsiderate toward them. More often than not, this language switch is for comfort. This was the first of sufficient instances that exposed a pattern in my time at Penn. In another class, I grew close to a few other Spanish-speaking students. One of them continuously suggested we switch back to English for seemingly no valid reason and would reply to any comment of mine in English.\u00a0\nThis harsh reality on campus expands into the club scene. In one instance, a native English speaker attended a club meeting primarily led in Spanish. Within this meeting, if club members asked questions in Spanish, any other members who answered quickly switched to English. Evidently, the intent is to have everybody be able to partake in conversation. However, members within a Spanish-led group should be able to detach from English formalities within club meetings, particularly if the club seeks to embrace Latinx heritage.\u00a0\nSpeaking in my primary language is the greatest manifestation of my culture, particularly since Spanish accents are so diverse throughout Latin America. Having to switch to English not only in academic settings but in seemingly every other sphere of Penn life further disconnects me from the culture I\u2019ve been surrounded by my entire life until now. This applies to any person whose main language isn\u2019t English, not only to Spanish speakers.\u00a0\n\t\tGet our newsletter, DP Daybreak, delivered to your inbox every weekday morning.Penn has students from over 100 countries, with around 19% of the student body being international. If one truly wants to immerse themselves in Penn\u2019s multilingual community, one needs to recognize that a language barrier works both ways. Just as an English speaker may be tired from learning another language, a non-English speaker can be drained from constantly speaking English. It\u2019s crucial to recognize that for the latter, multilingualism surpasses a simple language requirement and spills over to nearly every sector of their life at Penn.\u00a0\nLanguage fatigue is a true reality, especially for individuals who haven\u2019t learned English from a young age. Thus, if somebody within your social group is speaking their first language, which you are not fluent in, it does not give you the right to feel offended or urge them to speak in a tongue you understand. And, if you are a non-native English speaker, as much as you can, \"habla en tu primer idioma y que los dem\u00e1s se ubiquen.\"\nBEATRIZ B\u00c1EZ is a College first year studying mathematics and political science from San Juan, Puerto Rico.

And, if white is a moral choice, there is an enormous challenge: then you're challenging an entire civilization,\u201d said James Baldwin.\nWhiteness is the myth we\u2019ve been sold and under which we live. In our instruction at the University of Pennsylvania, we were told to reach for safety and to secure our decadence. So are the students now, but they are not nearly as certain that this is the road they\u2019d really like to walk. The students I knew have already paid that price for that ticket, and their horizons, on a human level, look bleak.\u00a0\n\t\tPhiladelphia is not a college town. It is a real city, a Black city, a poor city whose reality reflects the depth of the American crisis and yet contains the possibilities of its salvation. From the soil of this city rose heroes like Teddy Pendergrass, The Delfonics, McCoy Tyner, and Alfie Pollitt. A friend, then a nursing student who had packed her bags for New York City after graduation and returned a few years later to work in the hospitals, remarked on her return, \"Philadelphia has soul.\"\u00a0\nIn the five years since I\u2019ve graduated, the tone of campus has shifted. Students are developing a new language in order to deal with existential questions: What is the purpose of education and the responsibility of students in the wake of war? More than in my time, it is now clear that we, the students, want to be free. The crisis is deepening, and history is accelerating.\n\t\t\n\t\nFewer illusions are possible for the young mind in Philadelphia, which tempers and sharpens it like metal on metal. What the path to whiteness and an invented safety then produces is a delusional and unfree state. My peers, who are banking, coding, and consulting their lives away, are living as prisoners to the choices they\u2019ve made.\u00a0\nAll the beauty, genius, and potential I witnessed when we were young together, freshman year before the vicious teeth of Penn successfully \u201csocialized\u201d most of us, has been wasted, whittled down into dust, and lost. My old friends might have money, but they didn\u2019t manage to save their souls, and some part of them knows this fact \u2014 that they are perishing. We were never meant to become the fools and tools of the mythic America: the one that is superior, war-hungry, greedy, and hypocritical. These choices did their damage. That was an aberration. Now, we are entering a time of correction.\u00a0\n\tWe want to know the meaning of our lives when we live in a country whose hand assassinates a man and poet as beautiful and courageous as Refaat Alareer, when we live in a society in which Aaron Bushnell had to die so that humanity could live. When the youngest students of Philadelphia stand to say they are no different from the children of Palestine, that the bombs dropped abroad also explode in our neighborhoods, we then know it is true for ourselves \u2014 that we bleed the same as these children in Palestine, as all the men and women we encounter in Philadelphia.\u00a0\nOur bondage to the genocide in Gaza is through the struggle to become moral human beings in America, and to relinquish our country from the myths that strangle us and our people.\u00a0\nIt is unmistakable that the education Penn offers is bankrupt, and that some cancer, invisible but detectable, poisons our relationships to each other and to ourselves. The scramble for acceptance into mediocre clubs and fraternities is insufferable, and the false authority these groups stand on in order to make these judgments is embarrassing.

          "title": "Hanadi Abdulkadir | How poor dining hall food shapes our mental and academic capabilities",
          "article_content": "At this point, many Penn students have lived the terrible dining stories at a number of halls across campus. While it\u2019s important to discuss the health and sanitary risks associated with some of these concerns, it\u2019s also necessary to break down how this problem factors into students\u2019 academic and mental well-being.\u00a0\nOpening Sidechat every few days to see yet another picture of undercooked meat or hearing horror stories from my friends dissuades me from trekking across campus to eat at many of our dining halls. Oftentimes, I find myself skipping meals or stretching the time out between each one \u2014 until I accept the fact that I\u2019ll be eating the same food I already ate a couple times that week. Does this mean that I\u2019m probably missing out on some of the necessary vitamins or fiber I should be getting daily? Probably.\n\t\tNumerous Penn Dining Wellness emails live in our inboxes with tips on improving digestive health and practicing better healthy habits in our daily lives. Additionally, the official page for Penn Dining boasts awards and recognitions for sustainability and top college dining. However, the pristine and glossy promotional pictures of sandwiches, smoothies, and breakfast bowls tell a completely different story from the reality on campus.\nWith two of the most historical repeat offenders \u2014 Hill House and 1920 Commons \u2014 being the only consistent options available for on campus dining during the weekend, it\u2019s much more convenient to resort to the other retail spots scattered around campus. However, some of these locations are far apart, depending on where you live, and can add additional costs to weekly expenses. \u00a0\n\t\t\t\tSEE MORE FROM HANADI ABDULKADIR:\ufeffPenn should require an African American history courseWhy social media and Palestinian activism goes hand in handAdditionally, for students who are dishing out a hefty sum of money to enroll in the dining plan, going out of their way to seek expensive alternatives takes away money that could\u2019ve been better spent elsewhere. Considering that first years and sophomores are required to pick a dining plan for their first two years at Penn, it\u2019s no wonder that students have consistently called for the food standards to match the high prices of these meal swipes. Ideally, no student should feel like they need to resort to options outside of Penn; rather, outside options should be supplemental to an already quality level of options at all dining halls.\u00a0\nSince coming to Penn, my relationship with food has become much more complex. I need to look twice when picking out a seemingly clean utensil to eat whatever is on my plate or stare extra hard at my salad with suspicion before consuming it. But growing up, food was always a way for me to connect with my family and friends, to bring us back together even when we hadn\u2019t seen each other in a long time. Yet the food at Penn, at its worst, has left me frustrated and succeeded at suppressing my appetite \u2014 something I actually can relate to other students about.\n\tAlthough certain foods are scientifically linked to improving mental clarity and focus, I hesitate in reaching for those vegetables because they don\u2019t look as fresh or appetizing when lined up on display in Kings Court English House. As a result, I look for short-term solutions in coffee, which leaves me feeling tired earlier in the day or exhausted while trying to tackle my assignments at night. In order to meet my immediate deadlines, I prioritize some assignments over others, meaning some classes suffer in academic performance and perpetuate an almost never-ending cycle of playing catch-up. I believe that the root cause of all these problems can be traced back to the lack of decent dining.\u00a0\nThis same sentiment has been echoed by many of my friends and peers. But the dining quality at Penn can be mitigated if the University addresses the root problem. Whether that be promoting clean and sanitary workspaces when handling food or streamlining student complaints to Penn Dining other than through email, the University can restore student faith in the system. When it comes to campus dining, Penn can improve upon our experiences by implementing the changes that students deserve to enjoy, especially at the height of midterm season.\nHANADI ABDULKADIR is a College sophomore studying international relations from Philadelphia.

          "article_content": "During Penn\u2019s recent administrative upheaval, the University community found an unexpected silver lining: For the first time, Penn was making headlines alongside Harvard and MIT.\u00a0\nThe presidents of these three institutions were at the center of an infamous congressional hearing in December after their alleged missteps on campus antisemitism. I\u2019ll admit, there is something far more distasteful about chaos at the Capitol than the collective HYPSM prestige.\n\t\tBut many of us are taking our education at Penn for granted, shedding our \u201cque ser\u00e1, ser\u00e1\u201d optimism, and wondering at times what it would be like to go to a more recognizable Ivy. For decades, we\u2019ve all but exhausted our morale by clarifying to passersby that no, Penn State and Penn are not the same university. And yes, Penn is actually active in areas outside of Wharton\u2019s finance programs.\nSo, when Penn Engineering announced its new undergraduate program in artificial intelligence, many of us were enthusiastic about the University\u2019s growing role in the innovation sector: a space thought to be dominated by less business-oriented institutions.\n\t\t\t\tSEE MORE FROM MRITIKA SENTHIL: Removing legacy admissions will align Penn\u2019s actions more closely with its educational missionWhy changing leadership won\u2019t eliminate antisemitism at PennBut Penn\u2019s realization, of possibly its most practical initiative, begs the question: Is the University actually necessary in DevOps? Does sitting in a classroom \u2014 let alone one that\u2019s in the midst of a campus known for its influx of finance bros \u2014 really supersede what can be MacGyvered by a tech junkie with only a laptop, caffeine, and time? I want to give a definite \u201cno.\u201d Otherwise, I would need to hold my classmates and myself accountable for upholding all the exclusivity that comes with attending Penn. And yet, there are a frustrating number of anonymous netizens, D-list journalists, and LinkedIn bards who call Ivy League universities like Penn \u201cout of touch\u201d \u2014 remnants of centuries-old American elitism in an era of bottom-up grassroots movements.\nOne C-suite executive anticipates that \u201cthe best AI engineers and builders won\u2019t graduate Penn Engineering. They'll be global, builders and in the right group chats.\u201d His readers agree, with one commenter further emphasizing that \u201cuniversities cannot keep up with the pace of free market innovation.\u201d When these schools attempt to go against the grain and align with consumer needs, \u201cit genuinely looks embarrassing and out of date.\u201d\n\tIn an environment where the use of AI models is largely democratized, we\u2019re naturally drawn to the trope of a layperson who forgoes bureaucratic systems to channel their intelligence: creating life-changing inventions that would have never come to be under self-serving corporate and political influences. And when ignoring cases of succor \u2014 as mainstream media unfortunately does \u2014 there are many examples of such successes. Bill Gates and Paul Allen, co-founders of Microsoft, were university dropouts. So were Meta Platforms co-founders Mark Zuckerberg and Dustin Moskovitz. As Penn\u2019s over reliance on donors came to light earlier this school year, critics of the upper crust have continued to group Penn with other perpetrators of social stratification. The field of AI is, by nature, continuously evolving. And limiting growth in the discipline to those who can afford, and then succeed in Penn\u2019s Department of Computer and Information Science courses is counterproductive.\nHowever, these narratives misrepresent the intentions of Penn\u2019s AI program.\nTo make a better case for Penn\u2019s AI major, I spoke with Robert Ghrist, Andrea Mitchell Professor and associate dean for undergraduate education at Penn Engineering. He describes how the process of integrating AI in education is similar to the effects of increasing access to music recording and playback technologies. Now, there is \u201cmore music for everyone at much lower prices,\u201d he told me. Nonetheless, \u201cartists at the very top of the industry\u201d are increasingly the benefactors of \u201ca concentration of rewards.\u201d Taylor Swift is, as any current news feed can attest to, perhaps the most prolific embodiment of such phenomena. And professor Ghrist strives to make Penn an incubator of sorts for the \u201cTaylor Swifts of AI\u201d that seek avenues for academic growth, to actually be the \u201cleading edge where the best thrive.\u201d\nAnd to thrive in this discipline, aspiring AI mavens are off course by simply memorizing browser instructions in JavaScript and praying for a tech equivalent of the coveted Goldman Sachs internship. After all, studying AI is a philosophical pursuit: an inquiry into the nature of consciousness and ethics of creating sentient machines. It\u2019s also a political pursuit, for AI poses challenges in regulatory compliance. There are countless possible liabilities for even the most basic ChatGPT input, such as unprotected user data and violations of intellectual property rights. \u00a0\n\t\tGet our newsletter, DP Daybreak, delivered to your inbox every weekday morning.Needless to say, as you might have noticed in my earlier columns, I am not an AI major. I\u2019m not even enrolled in Penn Engineering. Am I, of all students, in the right to quash critics of the Penn AI major when I dropped AP Computer Science in high school (with no regrets)?\nYet, it\u2019s clearly irresponsible to follow the well-intentioned advice from tech capitalists when constant innovation is not particularly ideal for society. Maybe I\u2019m just afraid of a \"Black Mirror\"-esque dystopia, but there is a kind of ominous quality to the idea of highly skilled AI scientists off the reins. Penn, however, is cultivating an ecosystem that nurtures AI talent, albeit not by stifling the next Elon Musk or Sam Altman with red-tape-ridden academics; instead, Penn fosters ethically conscious innovation that addresses complex societal challenges. And so, the fact that I can engage with the Penn curricula across departments has a surprising beauty. The opportunity to become a part of this technological movement \u2014 or, dare I say, revolution \u2014 is the gift of studying AI at Penn.\nMRITIKA SENTHIL is a first year studying management and Russian and east European studies from Columbia, S.C.

          "article_content": "Artificial intelligence is a topic we can\u2019t seem to get enough of. From frequent announcements regarding policies within classrooms to endless professors and visiting scholars weighing in on the unprecedented effect large language models will have on our lives, I\u2019m sure we\u2019ve all discussed to death how revolutionary ChatGPT has become for college students.\u00a0\nMany of us have even had the chance to firmly establish positions on whether the University should embrace the technology wholeheartedly or put in place safeguards to prevent it from eroding the value of a college education, but up until now, the vast majority of conversations have been on a non-technical level.\n\t\tThat all potentially changed in this past month when Penn announced their first Bachelor of Science in Engineering in AI. Thankfully for us, Penn has chosen to launch this interdisciplinary degree at the \u201coptimal time\u201d to \u201ccreate a society where AI isn\u2019t just a tool, but a fundamental force for good to advance society.\u201d But at what cost? To what extent should we be using college as an opportunity to hyperfocus on not just a certain field (computer science), but a field within a field? Majoring in AI panders to the pre-professionalism Penn is known for and removes many of the foundational elements of the field that underlie innovation.\u00a0\nIn an interesting recent LinkedIn post, David Magerman pondered the implications of a university building complete undergraduate curriculums around a \u201cmodern business tool that is a niche application of computer science, diverting students away from a broad education in computer science.\u201d He went on to ask pointedly, \u201cWhat's next? A Bachelor of Arts in Blogging from the Annenberg School? A Wharton BS in Quantitative Trading?\u201d\n\t\t\t\tSEE MORE FROM AKIVA BERKOWITZ:The newsletter is dead\ufeffIsrael under attack: What do you stand for?As a current computer science major, I\u2019ll admit the AI curriculum looks fascinating. There is such an array of eye-catching electives (from Deep Generative Models to Natural Language Processing) that, if I were doing my degree all over again, I suspect I would have been swayed to switch into the major. But as a recently graduated computer and information science friend put it, the degree \u201cseems like the cool parts of CIS\u201d without the heavier basics like operating systems, computer systems, and physics \u2014 building blocks on the entire computer domain. \u00a0\nThe question I ask myself is whether artificial intelligence is really enough of an independent field that it transcends computer science and necessitates its own major. Is the relatively new field of AI established enough, broad enough, and unique enough such that the skills we gain through taking just those mostly career-focused courses today will undoubtedly remain relevant in 30 years and justify the $84,600 a year sticker price? I simply wonder how likely it may be that AI will become so unrecognizable in 20 or even 10 years, given its breakneck pace of innovation, that students may have wished that their majors in college focused on more fundamental elements of the field that innovators keep turning back to for insight.\u00a0\n\tAside from long-term career effectiveness an AI degree would have compared to computer science or electrical engineering, Penn is known for its pre-professional student body, and this new major shows signs of that sentiment leaking into the curriculum as well. In contrast to the Penn Integrates Knowledge professorships that bring in academic leaders who deeply understand multiple fields to better spark insight between them, this new major filters various courses of study to pluck out the elements we find valuable today.\u00a0\nIn this line of thinking, maybe we should consider the true value of a groundbreaking Wharton degree in quant trading that would promise to \u201csculpt the financial moguls of tomorrow\u201d with unparalleled prowess in algorithmic trading strategies and quantitative analysis.\u00a0\nAll this is to say, I immediately understand the value the current AI concentration within the larger CIS curriculum has. And I appreciate the Ph.D. programs that take students to a higher level of understanding, once they\u2019ve taken the time in their undergraduate training to build the broad foundations. I simply remain curious of the true value an AI undergraduate degree offers us as students over other forms of study within the field and the certain level of indulgence in pre-professionalism that it plays into on Penn\u2019s campus.

For the many students without access to a kitchen in their dorm, this presents an even bigger challenge. Luckily, college campuses have dining halls! Students simply swipe their card to get access to an all-you-care-to-eat dining experience. Dining halls provide easy access meals to students\u2014but what happens when that food is inedible?\nAs a picky eater, I know that simply because I do not like a dish does not mean it is unsafe to eat, but food with cockroaches and glass is unsafe for anyone. A seemingly obvious underlying assumption in dining is that food is safe to eat. College dining halls should be a place where students go to eat well-cooked, hairless, and insect-free food. However, that is not the case at Penn: There is a lack of responsibility to make sure the food is meeting basic standards for, let alone satisfying, all students.\u00a0\n\t\tMeal plans are far from cheap. For the sticker price, students would expect quality food, but they would be wrong. Both of the first-year student meal plan options cost $6,330, with the maximum amount of swipes being 296. Each meal swipe equates to roughly $17, which is about the same price as a Caniac Combo at Raising Cane's. As previously stated, Penn dining hall food is far from gourmet, and its price is too high for the quality delivered.\u00a0\nExpensive dining plan meals are not unique to Penn, but other Ivy League schools have similar prices for better quality food. Cornell University offers an unlimited meal plan, so students may visit the dining halls as much as they want with a fixed cost of $6,942 for food ranked second-best in the nation. So, for roughly 600 more dollars, Cornell students have access to unlimited meals and substantially better quality dining.\u00a0\n\t\t\t\tSEE MORE FROM ERIC NAJERA: \ufeffWe should be grateful to attend PennPenn clubs should have an assigned faculty member\ufeffAside from price and quality, weekend dining is another struggle. With the popular McClelland Sushi & Market and Houston Market being closed on Saturdays and the other dining halls closing at 8 p.m., food options are limited. Late-night study sessions means having to resort to local food places that remain open, and unlike nearby schools such as Drexel, our dining dollars do not work at off-campus restaurants and out-of-pocket money spent on takeout can add up quickly.\nBefore every school break, Sidechat is flooded with posts of excitement for home-cooked meals. In my classes, when asked what we are excited for, most students reply being able to eat good food. It is not uncommon for college students to miss their home-cooked meals, but when students are excited to actually eat food that is not served alongside insects, it signifies a problem.\n\tWith Penn\u2019s Bon App\u00e9tit contract still in place, we may not know how much Penn can do to change the dining experience. Safe, clean food should not be an unreasonable expectation. In order to enhance a student's experience outside the classroom, Penn must budget for an edible food experience for all students.\nERIC NAJERA is a College sophomore studying history from Rolling Meadows, Ill.

          "title": "Zaid Alsubaiei | Does Penn\u2019s diversity represent its sense of community?",
          "article_content": "We all know the typical \u201ctypes\u201d of high schoolers, the different clich\u00e9s: Where are my nerds at? But, another attribute of student groups that has become increasingly relevant in the 21st century United States is the diverse ethnic makeup of its population. And, frankly, do we as a campus mirror all that comes with that national trend of diversity?\nThink of the friends with whom you often hang out. Then, ask those friends with whom they usually go out. Finally, think of the groups you are a part of, the extracurriculars in which you partake. Notice a pattern?\n\t\t\u201c[D]espite increased opportunity to live and work in mixed-race settings, Americans remain racially segregated in their friendship patterns,\u201d a study published by the National Institutes of Health found. \u201cSpatial racism, cultural encapsulation, and personal choice are contributing factors for patterns of same-race friendships.\u201d\u00a0\nThis pattern seems to reflect the divisions present in Penn\u2019s social scene as well. Despite coming from all sorts of backgrounds across the world, the University\u2019s students appear to have unconsciously adopted a policy of self segregation. In other words, we like to \u201cstick to our own\u201d by socializing with others to whom we relate to on a cultural, ethnic, or religious basis. So, regardless of Penn\u2019s efforts to integrate people of differing experiences and beliefs, there still remains a degree of resistance by individuals themselves to cross those racial or cultural lines.\n\t\t\n\t\nAs a result, the potential for diversity of thought is threatened. A narrow mindset develops within these groups that students pledge to, and they effectively act as echo chambers that exacerbate already crippling political polarization. We relate to each other less, rely on our \u201cown\u201d more, and become less tolerant of the views, and thus experiences, of those who do not necessarily look, think, or speak like us.\nThis kind of thinking \u2014 whether manifested in the form of race, religion, or otherwise \u2014 has led to serious tension at times and enabled a distorted view of certain communities and how they experience Penn. I attribute part of that thinking not to the identity groups we are a part of, but to how much we value them over who we are as individuals.\n\tHomogenous communities definitely have their place in the college experience: They help ease our transition when we first arrive at Penn, and their role cannot be replaced. I say this as an international student myself, who had a hard time acclimating to an entirely different culture and, most radically, diet. Nonetheless, we should treat these organizations as an aid to finding belonging on campus, not a substitute for individual thought and expression.\nHowever, none of this means individuals can\u2019t agree or always need to separate themselves from the group. The use of a large, collective voice can benefit our campus much more than we realize. What is important to note is that there lies a clear distinction between acknowledging the views of others and forcing ourselves to accept those views for the sake of conformity.\nThere is nothing wrong with disagreeing with the majority, whether it is one against two or one against a nation (though some may try to tell you otherwise). As long as you are respectful and driven by a desire to learn rather than defend, there are no limits on what perspective you may question. So, challenge your beliefs, reevaluate your viewpoint, challenge that of others (no matter who they are), and then reevaluate yourself again. It\u2019ll be hard at first, to express your precise, genuine thoughts without fear. But, remember that you\u2019re not alone (I struggle sometimes myself) and that it\u2019s a process you won\u2019t always get right.\n\t\tGet our newsletter, DP Daybreak, delivered to your inbox every weekday morning.The hardest part of breaking out of groupthink, after realizing it, is talking about it. My advice? Take the plunge and never look back. The next time you are in a group and the majority agrees with an idea you don\u2019t like, let it be known. Talk about it and explain why you think the way you do. Don\u2019t worry if some get offended or others simply do not agree; it is normal and, in fact, expected.\u00a0\nNever forget that disputes you engage in are an opportunity, not a challenge, and our differences are enlightening, not threatening. Only then will we begin to understand and appreciate each other more as unique actors in a truly historic community.\nZAID ALSUBAIEI is a College first year studying economics from Al-Khobar, Saudi Arabia.

          "title": "Eliza Carroll | You are what you read: Sidechat\u2019s impact on campus",
          "article_content": "I downloaded Sidechat this fall after my friends sent me too many screenshots of funny memes or jokes posted on the anonymous app. I figured that doing so would simply remove the middleman. I was already being exposed to the same jokes, memes, comments and judgements as those on the app anyway \u2026 right?\u00a0\nIn December, I returned home for reading days and fell into an easy pattern of studying. Nothing I did was wildly exciting or social, but I instead found myself enjoying the routine and satisfaction of productivity. During my study breaks, I would scroll on Sidechat \u2014 and from the comfort of my home, I felt myself spiraling into anxious dread about returning to Penn. Each time I opened the app, I was faced with a barrage of posts all echoing the same sentiment: Penn is awful and depressing. Without a second thought, I accepted those posts as fact, and in doing so, I allowed Sidechat to have more power than it deserves. In other words, I subscribed to the complaining culture that is pervasive on Sidechat.\u00a0\n\t\tUsing Sidechat, especially without intentional thought, is a way of looking at Penn through hypercritical glasses. Perhaps this is because negativity has been normalized and cynicism gets more upvotes. To some extent, this pessimistic messaging is diluted with the insertion of mildly entertaining memes or jokes, but the result is still the same. With each scroll, Sidechat is perpetuating a defeatist perspective of Penn.\u00a0\nSo, I arrived back at Penn to take my final exam: openly unhappy about returning to what I thought would be a bleak campus as a result of discourse on Sidechat. But to my surprise, it was not horrific, and I was able to enjoy my weekend of studying just as I had my week at home. The sheer volume of disheartening posts on Sidechat had clouded my perspective and ability to see the best in the situation. Sure, I was becoming one with a Huntsman GSR while others were at home enjoying break, but on the other hand, I was with my friends and able to have a sleepy campus all to myself.\n\t\t\t\tAs is the case with most other social media platforms, Sidechat is consumed passively and without a second thought \u2014 it\u2019s used to pass time, curb boredom, and satiate our addictions to our phones. And yet, students are absorbing and internalizing content more quickly than they can truly digest it.\u00a0\nGiven the bandwagon culture on Sidechat, users often build off of one another, creating a chaotic, and often dismal, echo chamber that does not truly represent life at Penn. Whether or not college is the best four years of your life, it is at least what you make of it, and Sidechat enables students to feel like victims of an unknown cause. For those who are actually struggling, Sidechat acts not as a productive outlet, but rather as a meta ether that provides no remedy other than the satisfaction that others are unhappy too.\u00a0\n\tSince winter break, I have in fact deleted Sidechat and am all the better for it. I still get sent the best and the brightest jokes by my friends, but I am no longer overwhelmed by unsolicited complaints on an hourly basis. Without Sidechat, my thoughts on the housing lottery, the floods in the Quad, and upcoming midterms are completely my own. Deleting Sidechat may not be for everyone, but it\u2019s imperative for those who chose to use Sidechat to take a more critical view of what is being circulated and evaluate whether or not they are benefiting from it. It may just change the way they see Penn.\u00a0\nELIZA CARROLL is a College first year studying international relations and art history from Greenwich, Conn.

          "title": "Cathy Li and Liala Sofi | History can\u2019t repeat itself; stand with Chinatown",
          "article_content": "Students for the Preservation of Chinatown protested outside the Board of Trustees meeting held at the Inn at Penn on Mar. 3, 2023. \nA few weeks ago, the streets of Chinatown came to life with firecrackers and lion dances ringing in the year of the dragon. As you walk through the brightly colored 40-foot paifang \u2014 known to most as Chinatown\u2019s Friendship Gate \u2014 you enter into a cultural oasis that has stood strong in the heart of Philadelphia for nearly 150 years. Beyond this fixture, Chinatown serves as a home to nearly 3,000 residents and numerous family-owned businesses, restaurants, shops, and community organizations. Whether you are going to Ken\u2019s Seafood Restaurant for a fun night out or Heng Fa for groceries, Chinatown feels like home.\u00a0\nUnfortunately, this community has been under constant attack for decades and is once again facing the threat of displacement and gentrification from a plan to develop an arena for the Philadelphia 76ers merely a block away. We firmly stand with the Students for the Preservation of Chinatown and urge you to do the same. \u00a0\n\t\tSince the early 1900s, Chinatown has been a victim of gentrification often driven by predatory infrastructure projects. In 1932, the construction of subway infrastructure at Ridge and Eighth streets \u2014 and the subsequent development of the Vine Street Expressway from 1957 to 1991 \u2014 resulted in the destruction of buildings and severe divisions within the community. Bringing in noise and pollution, the expressway eroded neighborhoods and people's quality of life. This was not Chinatown's sole battle, however, as it also faced multiple proposals of developments for a federal prison in 1992, a baseball stadium in 2000, and a casino in 2008.\u00a0\nThe story of Philadelphia's Chinatown mirrors other Chinatowns across the nation. Amid the 1994 fiscal crisis in Washington, D.C., then-Washington Wizards owner Abe Pollin negotiated a deal for the downtown Capital One Arena, where the city covered pre-development costs to acquire and demolish properties. Entrepreneurs in Washington's Chinatown voiced concerns about prices of real estate skyrocketing and parking impacts on businesses in the area. A decade later, most Chinese residents were forced to move out due to unaffordable housing. The parking shortage led to the closure of the last Chinese grocery store, accelerating the decline of the Chinese American population in the area to fewer than 400 residents today. Ironically, as D.C.\u2019s arena now relocates to the suburbs, the community is left behind, having endured irreversible destruction while in the midst of its recovery from the pandemic.\u00a0\n\t\t\t\tMORE FROM LIALA SOFI AND CATHY LI:Liala Sofi | The hypocrisy of billionaire philanthropistsCathy Li | Philadelphia\u2019s changing tastesIn New York\u2019s Chinatown, threats of displacement and economic insecurity also loom high. In 2021, the Museum of Chinese in America accepted a donation of $35 million in support of a borough-based jail complex which would displace Chinese American working-class people in the area. On top of that, its board executives were connected to the closing of the last unionized restaurant, beloved Jing Fong banquet hall, and construction of luxury towers that are actively raising rent and real estate taxes in the area.\nIn Philadelphia, the current 76Place project is being developed by 76 DevCo, an initiative by 76ers managing partners Josh Harris, David Blitzer, and David Adelman. Adelman is at the forefront of the construction of the arena and has promised not to displace the residents or businesses in Chinatown, but his past actions speak louder than his current words. Adelman works closely with Brett Altman, who also owns the University City Townhomes, and was a key figure behind the demolition and end of affordable housing in the West Philadelphia area that was previously known as the \"Black Bottom.\u201d This constant cycle of displacing residents and communities that have lived in the area for generations must end, and we must be the voice to make this happen.\n\tDevelopers of the project have stated that the arena will \u201cserve as a model for an equitable & inclusive community,\u201d yet there is not a single mention of Chinatown in the proposal. Efforts to ensure communities can benefit from this project read as empty promises when nearly 95% of residents, business owners, and visitors oppose the arena\u2019s construction.\nMany questions posed by residents have also gone unanswered by 76 DevCo. How will restaurants and small businesses in the surrounding area be protected? Who will clean the streets after huge events?\u00a0\nPreserving Philadelphia's architectural heritage demands careful consideration in urban development, but the development of the arena does the exact opposite \u2014 jeopardizing accessible low-income and senior housing complexes, healthcare clinics, and schools for children.\nPenn has direct ties to the developers in the area, and students should be cognizant of the situation. Adelman currently sits on Penn Medicine Board of Trustees and is the CEO of Campus Apartments, which houses many Penn students off-campus. But more importantly, Penn students are directly and indirectly involved in the Chinatown community, whether that be Penn Lions performing all throughout the city for Lunar New Year, or student groups like SPOC organizing initiatives to honor traditions celebrating the multi-ethnic communities that reside there.\u00a0\nDespite what greedy developers may suggest, Chinatown is not an ethnic theme park but a home. It\u2019s more than just a place to eat, it\u2019s a support network and a cultural hub for immigrants and visitors alike.\nIn the face of ongoing threats, Chinatown has demonstrated remarkable resilience and activism, advocating for the needs of all diverse communities of color that are integrated into the cultural fabric of our city. The next time you are in Chinatown, take a look around at all the place has to offer. Venture into Ebisu for some home decor and enjoy a Mochinut donut as you shop. Come by Dae Bak for soul-nourishing Korean barbecue. The opportunities to support your favorite restaurants and local businesses are endless.\nPlease don't turn a blind eye to what is happening outside the Penn bubble. Pay attention to what SPOC and other organizers are doing in the fight for the preservation of Chinatown. Educate yourself on what is going on in Chinatowns across the country. If you can, participate in programming like Crane Chinatown Community Center art exhibitions or Show Your Love for Chinatown events to learn more about the challenges facing the neighborhood. Sign petitions. \u00a0\nAdorned with dragon motifs, and gorgeous ornamental roof tiles, the Friendship Archway is not only an architectural masterpiece, but a labor of love \u2014\u00a0created for community by community. The engineers and artisans from Tianjin, China \u2014 Philadelphia\u2019s sister city \u2014 came together with residents and the city of Philadelphia to fund and invest in Chinatown, and you should too.\u00a0\nThe next time you walk through the gate, remember that the fight for Philadelphia\u2019s Chinatown, and Chinatowns everywhere, is not over.

          "title": "Caroline Magdolen | \u201cEveryone cheats.\u201d What can we do about it?",
          "article_content": "My guess is that nearly everyone reading this article knows someone who has been academically disingenuous, or been that someone before. Being academically dishonest isn\u2019t all about flashy examples, like the two admitted Penn students accused of plagiarism and fabricating data in 2022. There are smaller violations that may feel less egregious, or even harmless, like querying ChatGPT for help completing your homework, peeking at a friend\u2019s lab assignment, or answering a PollEverywhere as if you\u2019re in class, when really, you\u2019re snoozing in your dorm.\nAcademic dishonesty is having a moment in the spotlight. The advent of generative AI, the use of which cannot be reliably detected by grading softwares, will likely upend student learning for better or worse. At the same time, examples of plagiarism by prominent academics are being dug up left and right. The former president of Harvard, Claudine Gay, was ousted in part due to plagiarism concerns, and Business Insider found that former MIT professor Neri Oxman (the wife of billionaire Bill Ackman, who led the campaign against Gay) \u201cstole sentences and whole paragraphs from Wikipedia, other scholars and technical documents in her academic writing.\u201d\n\t\tTo be clear, I believe that academic dishonesty at Penn \u2014 going against community standards that your professor has explicitly outlined \u2014 is unacceptable, and that we should be doing more to penalize and prevent it.\nNevertheless, we must also acknowledge that academic dishonesty is understandable, in that we can piece together students\u2019 rationales when they do cheat, and even sympathize with them in some cases.\n\t\t\t\tSEE MORE FROM CAROLINE MAGDOLEN:\ufeffThe Rat Kings of PennThere\u2019s no better time for climate education\ufeffTo dissuade academic dishonesty, we employ sayings like, \u201cIt will only hurt you in the long run to cheat,\u201d or \u201cYou\u2019re taking advantage of other students who've completed their work fairly.\u201d This is true in some circumstances. If you\u2019re an aspiring quant and you\u2019re asking ChatGPT to calculate all of the derivatives on your MATH 1400 homework, it\u2019s going to show: First in your exams for the class, then in every math class you take thereafter, and especially in your future career. And if MATH 1400 is curved, your dishonest success capitalizes on the honest failures of others \u2014 not cool.\nBut this is not true in all cases. Jane* was a first year in her spring term when she was taking CIS 1210: Data Structures and Algorithms \u2014 a famously challenging CIS course \u2014 with Rajiv Gandhi, a famously challenging professor.\u00a0\n\tShe cheated on her coding assignment late into the semester, and as per the professor\u2019s policy, received a -300/100 on the submitted homework and zeros on all previously submitted homework, receiving a D as her final grade in the course.\nBut Jane believes that what is more important to her story is not what happened, but why it happened.\u00a0\n\u201cWhat drove me to make a bad decision? Why are [these classes] so infamous? It\u2019s because of notorious policies where you cannot collaborate on many assignments. You are given long problem sets to do, on your own, each week, with desperate students in office hour queues that are two to four hours long. Many times, you will go to the TA and not get a clear answer. It is a profoundly isolating situation, particularly for freshmen just entering college, and that\u2019s what drives well-meaning people to cheat.\u201d\nBased on my conversation with Jane, it seemed that she felt isolated at the time and was struggling to reach out for the support that she needed, both in CIS 1210 and at Penn as a whole. And given the limited support Jane could receive from TAs and her instructor, backtracking her friend\u2019s code felt more conducive to her learning than doing nothing.\nJane expressed a lot of remorse over what happened, and said that she still has a lot of respect for Rajiv, maintaining a good relationship with him to this day. She was also grateful that Rajiv was willing to handle this internally, since a low grade in the class looks better than a formal statement on her transcript, detailing her violation of academic integrity.\n\u201cI deserved to be punished harshly,\u201d Jane said. \u201cBut the collaboration policies of these introductory courses, and the punishment I received, wrecked my self-esteem and my early college experience. I felt that there was no way out.\u201d\nAccording to Jane, Rajiv's philosophy is to \"let go of your grades early: the sooner you stop caring about your GPA and start caring about learning, the better.\" She agrees with this philosophy, especially since he curves his courses generously, but sees this as out of touch with the realities of many Penn students.\nAfter students have prioritized perfecting their grades and resumes (and have been praised for it) in high school, those habits won\u2019t get undone overnight. Even at Penn, there are many institutions and accolades that continue to reward \u201cperfect\u201d performance over pursuing difficult academic disciplines, experimenting, and invariably messing up sometimes.\nFrankly, for a pre-med student in computer science (a track which Jane was considering at the time), the adage that \u201ccheating will hurt you in the long run\u201d skill-wise doesn\u2019t hold much water. The skillset of a future doctor and a software engineer just don\u2019t overlap enough. What can hurt a pre-med in the long run is a low GPA.\nAnd while there are some students for whom projects, internships, and technical interviews will get them a lot further in guaranteeing their success, this is not true for everyone. For many preprofessional students who may want to challenge themselves with a major or minor in CIS, they risk getting shut out of the study altogether.\nWhat frustrates me most about this entire situation is not that such harsh action was taken, but that it appears ineffective in tackling the issue at hand. If a student wanted to cheat, they could just take CIS 1600 or CIS 1210 during a different semester, when a different instructor was in charge and penalties were anecdotally known for being less harsh.\nWhile Jane\u2019s actions were clearly wrong, I can\u2019t help thinking that she was just the unlucky example that had to face the music, and she said as much in our interview: \u201cEveryone cheats in this class. You don\u2019t survive [CIS 1600 or CIS 1210] without talking to people, it just depends on whether you get caught. That doesn\u2019t make cheating okay, but it does mean that we need to rethink how these courses operate.\u201d\nSo, what can we do so that not everyone cheats?\nThis is a complex question, and there is no easy answer. It is crucial that as we frame the issue of academic integrity violations, we look at both the violations themselves and the root motivations that drive them \u2014 these actions are not taking place in a vacuum.\u00a0\nAcademic integrity violations these days are, to an extent, simply easier to commit. ChatGPT has led to a surge in \u201cunfair advantage\u201d violations. And even before generative AI, the pandemic had uprooted our usual test-taking environment. Now that classes are in person again, we no longer need to have take-home or open-Internet exams, but these still persist in some classes, and are easier to cheat on. Penn, given its history of fraudulent alumni, isn\u2019t going to be a place where professors can blindly trust students to refrain from cheating when presented with the option, so professors should take some responsibility for leveling the playing field in the classroom too.\u00a0\nJulie Nettleton, the executive director of Penn\u2019s Center for Community Standards and Accountability (CSA), relayed over email that CSA already works closely with schools and centralized resources at Penn to discuss how to proctor exams, and with faculty to discuss exams, syllabi language, and classroom policies.\nWhat constitutes a violation itself is currently not standard across classes, or even across different sections of the same class. How to handle a concern of academic integrity falls to the professor first \u2014 this is how Jane completed CIS 1210 with a lower grade, rather than a formal sanction from the CSA. It makes sense to delegate this responsibility to professors: It is more efficient than having the CSA handle every case, and professors should have the freedom to decide what constitutes cheating in their classrooms.\nHowever, this does open the door to students deliberately choosing sections of a course with professors that have more relaxed academic integrity policies. Conversely, some professors can be overly harsh, to the point where they are acting unfairly towards their students.\u00a0\nJill*, another student that I interviewed for this article, was falsely accused by her professor of collaborating on her final exam with her peers. At the start of winter break, the professor sent a class-wide email imploring those who worked together on the take-home exam to turn themselves in or have the matter escalated. Jill recalls that for students that turned themselves in, the professor lowered their grades accordingly \u2014 everyone else was reported to the CSA.\nIn the end, Jill\u2019s name was cleared, but she was assigned a case manager that seemed to have assumed she was guilty by default. As the case progressed, many of the details that the professor used to build the case against her appeared superfluous \u2014 for example, she and her friends had all rounded to the same decimal place in their work. Jill suspects that the escalation may have been personal: she had previously asked the professor, on behalf of the class, if he could make changes to his teaching style to facilitate learning.\nIt seems wrong to me that a professor could accuse a student and cause such extensive stress when in the end, Jill turned out to be innocent. It reminded me of some other methods that professors use to catch students cheating, such as Turnitin\u2019s flawed AI detector.\nPart of the solution to rampant academic dishonesty may also lie in expanding our vocabulary to discuss the issue, as John McWhorter pointed out in The New York Times. A class-wide cheating ring, direct plagiarism of original ideas from a paper as one\u2019s own, and copying a line of someone\u2019s code all constitute academic dishonesty, but range broadly in terms of severity and \u201cease of catching.\u201d However, this is rarely reflected in academic integrity policies.\u00a0\nIt can be awkward to suggest that some forms of dishonesty are worse than others, and more awkward still to draw the line between different punishments for different violations, but we must still have these conversations.\u00a0\nWhat should constitute dishonesty at all? When speaking with Jane, she would often circle back to how isolating it was to work alone on her assignments as a first year in introductory computer science courses, particularly as a woman in STEM. Every day, she would walk out of class \u201cfeeling way worse about [her]self.\u201d Now exploring chemistry, physics, and biology courses, she greatly appreciates the change in her academic environment, where students are encouraged to openly collaborate.

          "title": "Jack Lakis | What we can learn from Penn\u2019s college ranking",
          "article_content": "Last fall, a plethora of new results from U.S. News & World Report, Wall Street Journal, and Forbes elevated Penn in their national college rankings. Nearly every list places Penn among the top 10, some going as far as placing the University among the top five. This universal growth resulted from a key change in most of these sources\u2019 metrics: greater consideration given to postgraduate salaries.\nPenn famously has one of the highest-earning alumni bodies in the country. Starting salaries for Penn graduates are often considered the highest in the Ivy League. By mid-career, the average Penn alum is raking in $165,000 annually, while the national average for a college graduate caps out at $74,000.\n\t\tPenn draws a great deal of prestige from its potential to produce high earners, which is a direct result of our school\u2019s preprofessional culture. Nearly 50% of all Penn graduates enter one of two career fields: consulting or finance. This pipeline allows most Penn alumni to matriculate into high-paying jobs shortly after graduation.\nI\u2019m usually a defender of preprofessionalism. It\u2019s crucial that Penn graduates are able to find good jobs, and high salary potential is an immense advantage. But those jobs aren\u2019t everything. Many universities are making gains in rankings and name recognition based on alumni outcomes in public service careers.\n\t\t\t\t\ufeffSEE MORE FROM JACK LAKIS:\ufeffDo we all hate Penn?Staying focused after Magill's resignation\ufeffFor example, Harvard University boasts about its eight presidential alumni. However, when 1968 Wharton graduate Donald Trump was elected president, Penn mostly ignored his history with the school. Given his proximity to controversy and his unconventional political history, Penn\u2019s bump in prestige was limited by Trump\u2019s election. Our second closest claim to the White House is the University\u2019s relationship with President Joe Biden and the opening of the Penn Biden Center. I argue that this is as far as Penn\u2019s ties to the presidency will go. Nowadays, Penn\u2019s laser focus on professional development might repel students who will one day have presidential potential.\nComparable institutions to Penn have high-earning graduates and prestigious placements throughout the government, nonprofit sector, and the advocacy space. For example, Georgetown University feeds graduates into congressional offices and many Fulbright programs. Princeton University also regularly features its flashy roster of graduates in powerful political offices. These universities maintain a strong presence in the private sector but are also actively represented in government positions.\n\tIn these examples, the institution itself sponsors an undergraduate school dedicated to public service. At Georgetown, it\u2019s the School of Foreign Service, while at Princeton the role is filled by the School of Public and International Affairs.\nI propose that Penn follow suit and create a fifth undergraduate school dedicated to public affairs. This new school could absorb Penn\u2019s wildly popular social science programs, like PPE (Philosophy, Politics and Economics), Political Science, and Economics. Currently, most students in these majors are scooped up by consulting firms and investment banks. If these students were given an intentional focus on service and social responsibility, perhaps they could feel empowered to use their degrees in a more meaningful way.\nThe least Penn can do is expand its current effort to bridge the gap between social science degree seekers and careers in government and nonprofits. It\u2019s crucial that our student body actively engages with the robust policy infrastructure that Penn has already made available: Civic House, Perry World House, opportunities like Penn in Washington, and extracurricular engagements offered by the Government and Politics Association. From what I\u2019ve seen, these resources are underutilized at Penn. By snubbing them, Penn students are working against the general interests of the University to gain prestige.\n\t\tGet our newsletter, DP Daybreak, delivered to your inbox every weekday morning.Besides, it's about more than just rankings. We have the potential to empower our students to become leaders in society. TIME Magazine ranks Penn as the third-best college for aspiring leaders. However, the article states its rationale for this placement as a concentration of graduates in business careers. Other chart-topping schools on this list were noted for their programs in law, medicine, and more.\nUltimately, private sector homogeneity marks one of Penn\u2019s key weaknesses. As we move forward, Penn has a duty to educate leaders in more than one field. If Penn strengthened its programs in civic engagement, more graduates would be inclined to pursue roles in government and could elevate Penn\u2019s cultural stature. We should be known for more than salaries. We can do more than business.\nJACK LAKIS is a College first year studying political science from Kennesaw, Ga.

          "title": "Mia Vesely | Black Penn is vibrant this month and every month",
          "article_content": "As of late, most of my columns have focused on things I take issue with: Whether it\u2019s Liz Magill\u2019s resignation and the threats to free speech on campus, or the lack of racial diversity in Panhellenic sororities. I haven't highlighted the things that I truly appreciate and, more specifically, the places in which I\u2019ve found community at Penn.\nLast February, I argued that Black history is important for everyone. Education surrounding Black people, their lives, and their contributions should be integrated into the standard curriculum. Black Penn shows up and shows out every month, but this month in particular, there are many events and ways that Penn student organizations uplift the community and come together.\u00a0\n\t\tIt would be impossible to touch on all of these amazing events and their impacts, but I\u2019d like to paint a picture of some of these groups and their initiatives during this month and beyond. Planning for these events takes months. For example, when Descendants of Afro-Americans at Penn (DAAP) \u2014 a club founded just last year \u2014 put on their first-ever gala on Feb. 1 to kick off the month, you better believe that the event was well-planned and executed.\u00a0\nThe gala \u2014 Red Carpet For A Cause \u2014 supported the Sickle Cell Disease Association of America's Philadelphia and Delaware Valley Chapter. The night included catered food, live performances from student groups like The Inspiration, wonderful community, and beautiful decor\u2014even including an ice sculpture of the DAAP logo. Over $1,700 was raised in support of the foundation.\n\t\t\t\tSEE MORE FROM MIA VESELY:\ufeffI dropped sorority rush and I\u2019m gladFirst Liz Magill, next free speechWhen asked about the impacts of the event, College sophomore and DAAP founding member Clarke Dickens said, \u201cWe wanted to bring the community together for a great cause, especially a cause that affects a lot of African Americans and Black people more broadly.\u201d\nSickle cell disease occurs in about one in every 365 Black babies born in the United States. The percentage of Black people who carry the trait is even higher, with one in 13 Black babies being born as carriers.\n\tDickens is not just involved with DAAP, but is also on the boards for QBlack and Shea Collective.\nThese clubs are all part of something commonly dubbed \u201cBlack Penn,\u201d which focuses on so many different aspects of identity. From cultural organizations like Penn African Student Association (PASA), to preprofessional organizations like Black Wharton and the Black Pre-Law Association (BPLA), to community service organizations like the NAACP, all of these organizations put an emphasis on service both inside the Penn community and out.\u00a0\nFor example, Campus Curlz \u2014 a club I serve on the board of \u2014 is, at first glance, a club centered around uplifting natural hair and embracing positivity. \u00a0But underlying hair mask making events and movie nights, there is a strong commitment to service. Just this month, the community service committee held an event where we made Valentine\u2019s Day cards for senior citizens at Mercy Life West Philadelphia.\nService by board members is a requirement to be part of funding organizations like UMOJA \u2014 the umbrella funding organization for Black clubs \u2014 and even beyond that, many clubs center service in every activity they partake in. Whether you\u2019re on the board of a club or not, there are many service opportunities available and encouraged.\nWhen asked what they wish people knew about Black Penn, Dickens said, \u201cClubs should make an effort to include grad students, it makes all the difference. I\u2019m able to say, \u2018This is what I would look like coming here for grad school,\u2019 and it can even offer opportunities for mentorship.\u201d\nWhat seems to drive Black Penn is first and foremost the students, then the supportive and involved faculty, as well as the local partnerships and opportunities the clubs find, build, and pursue for themselves. Many members of the DAAP board are native to Philadelphia, so that makes their work even more personal.\nWhile Black students do take initiative to realize what they need and create the spaces they want to see, there is so much room for improvement on behalf of Penn: whether it\u2019s stratifying the way funding is given to these clubs \u2014 they often can\u2019t fund silverware in UMOJA meetings if it can be provided elsewhere \u2014 or improving the cultural spaces available to students (we were promised the ARCH \u2018building,\u2019 not the ARCH \u2018basement\u2019). In months like February, Penn aims to spotlight their Black students. I just wish this recognition of the incredible community Black students forged for themselves, when they initially didn\u2019t see it on campus, came year-round.\n\t\tGet our newsletter, DP Daybreak, delivered to your inbox every weekday morning.Events like DAAP's gala happen every month, and it\u2019s important not to understate the role these organizations play in making Penn a welcoming and accepting place for students from marginalized backgrounds.\nI was happy to see Faces of Black Penn \u2014 a Black-run publication \u2014 highlighted in the DP last week. I hope people continue to uplift the work of these student groups going forward and make space to give all students their roses. Black History Month is not over, and the time to appreciate Black students and their work does not end come March.\nMIA VESELY is a College sophomore studying philosophy, politics, and economics from Phoenix, A.Z.

          "title": "Bernadine Kumi | I joined a sorority and I\u2019m glad",
          "article_content": "I\u2019ll be honest: I was not a fan of Greek life when I first got to Penn. My perception of Greek life was influenced by growing up in the South, mainly in suburban Georgia. This included a sorority scene of girls with fake spray tans and little to no personality. The images of sorority girls from the University of Georgia and Alabama screamed no diversity, which made me wary of joining a sorority at Penn. Being a First-Generation, Low-Income (FGLI) student made me especially hesitant. Even more so, coming from a Ghanaian household, the notion of a sorority was immediately dismissed as something against our Christian values. Thus, during my first year, I knew I would never, and I mean never, join a sorority.\u00a0\nHowever, by the beginning of sophomore year, my mindset began to change. After a year on campus, I had found a solid community of a small group of friends. But beyond that, I felt that I did not really know anyone. I couldn\u2019t name more than 20 people in my grade. Penn is known for being a networking school, and the \u201cSocial Ivy,\u201d so I began to question just how much I had taken advantage of that. That, along with most of the underclassmen party scene revolving around fraternities, made the idea of rushing even more appealing.\u00a0\n\t\tSo while most people were beginning their sophomore year with the friends they already had, I began to look for additional friends. My twin sister, who also goes to Penn, and I began attending open rush events, talking to sophomores in sororities, and involving ourselves in more social events. Over the next few months, my days consisted of talking to many girls, going to dinners, and putting myself out there in a way that I had been hesitant to do before. I made new friends, met fellow sophomores also in search of a bigger community, and found myself loving the idea of joining a sorority.\u00a0\nBut what made me even more eager was just how inclusive and diverse sororities were at Penn, more so than I had been expecting\u2014especially the off-campus sorority I ended up joining, OAX. I was still wary about rushing, but as soon as I got to the first event, I immediately felt comfortable. There were girls with different interests, passions, economic backgrounds, and personalities. Not a single conversation felt forced. Every girl I met had a unique and authentic story, and I felt like I could talk to them for hours.\n\t\t\t\tSEE MORE FROM BERNADINE KUMI:\ufeffDining hall workers at Penn Hillel demand better treatment from UniversityI was especially captivated by BLOAX (Black OAX), a community within OAX that includes fellow girls of Ghanaian descent and other Black girls who provided me with guidance on navigating Penn as a Black woman. OAX also has other smaller communities, such as LatinOAX and RainbOAX. Being able to find other people with similar backgrounds made the choice to join a sorority that much easier.\u00a0\nAs a FGLI student and Questbridge scholar, the idea of paying high dues out of my minimal work paychecks every month was unfathomable. I knew that joining a sorority would pose another financial burden, and even though I was loving the OAX community, the idea of paying dues scared me. Yet once again, OAX and other sororities surprised me with their understanding and financial transparency. They worked with me to develop an affordable monthly payment plan so that I, like every other girl interested in rushing, could also enjoy being in a sorority.\u00a0\n\tSince the morning of Bid Day when I got \u201cthe call,\u201d I know that I truly made the right decision by joining a sorority, for not only my social life but my professional life too. This past fall, I was able to land a summer internship in Los Angeles with the help of my grand-big. I was also able to prepare for my interview with girls in my sorority, who gave me the confidence I needed to land the opportunity. As a Black woman and FGLI student, I have truly benefited from joining Greek life. I hope students who are hesitant to rush, just as I once was, will see my experience and how transformative it can be. I hope others \u2014 whether they are Black women, FGLI students, or just Penn students in search of a greater community \u2014 can do the same.\nBERNADINE KUMI is a College junior studying political science and legal studies and history from Roswell, Ga.

          "title": "Jack Lakis | Let\u2019s talk about writing seminars",
          "article_content": "Before students establish their majors and concentrations, each undergraduate begins their degree by fulfilling general education requirements. While the College has its sectors and Wharton has its fundamentals, there is one requirement universal to all four of Penn\u2019s undergraduate schools: the critical writing seminar.\nWriting seminars are an integral part of Penn\u2019s first-year experience. While many students on our campus joke that the only point of writing seminar was to experience an awkward \u2018situationship,\u2019 these classes are poised to set one up for professional and academic success. They have a duty to prepare students for their time in school and beyond. However, for many members of our campus, the writing seminar is falling short of that goal.\n\t\tThe standardization of all writing seminars solidifies them as a curricular oddity at Penn. With next semester\u2019s topics ranging from biotechnology to reality TV, writing seminars present a broad spectrum of concepts. Yet, all students complete the same Canvas modules and submit the same assignments. The curriculum itself is strong, as it centers two principal writing genres: white paper and op-ed. Each of these styles have immense pre-professional applications. White papers are used broadly in business, marketing, policy, law, and more. As well, op-eds mark a crucial element of journalistic writing that teaches students how to communicate in a conversational style.\nThat curriculum also includes many valuable lessons, containing everything from detailed instructions for citation methods to a discussion on the significance of languaging. However, students rarely gain remarkable insight or skill development from these exercises. The course is too broad and the assignments don\u2019t delve deep enough into each topic, leading to great topical potential, but meaningless depth. Students aren\u2019t left with much to work with. In fact, many parts of the class are only explored in online modules, never through in-class instruction.\n\t\t\t\tWorse, with the exception of summative submissions like the midterm and final portfolios, almost none of the course\u2019s assignments are evaluated on quality. When nearly every assignment is graded on a scale of completion, not effort, there is no motivation for students to engage with material. These lessons over more niche topics are meaningless when students don\u2019t care to give them the time and attention they deserve. If students are left with little incentive to produce a high quality product, why should we expect writing seminars to be anything but a waste of time?\nThat\u2019s just the beginning, though. In many ways, Penn has institutionalized a lack of care for the very classes they require us to take. Another example of this neglect rests in the hiring practices for writing seminar professors. Each of them is required to have terminal qualifications in the subject of their class\u2019s research text, not in the discipline of writing. As well, these professors are offered short, one-year contracts and are not eligible for tenure consideration. In practice, Penn allots professors to the critical writing program when they are not being considered to teach in their departments of expertise. As is, the system does not seem to acknowledge the value that writing classes could bring to an educational experience. Yet, Penn has recognized the usefulness of writing skills through its institution-wide mandate of them.\n\tI love to write, but many parts of this course left me unfulfilled. Reflecting on the experience as a whole, the course introduced me to new forms of writing, but I am unsure if it truly enhanced what I am capable of. Thinking back to other composition-related classes that I\u2019ve taken, my Penn writing seminar is not the one that I feel was most formative. In fact, our Critical Writing Program might be outpaced by one of America\u2019s most popular high school courses.\nSo, how do we fix our writing requirement? While not everything at Penn needs to be excessively rigorous, a system that actively rewards a lack of effort among students and professors will never be effective. Therefore, I would contend that even the smallest of writing seminar assignments must be graded for quality, not just completion. As well, I would like to see Penn\u2019s Critical Writing Program put forth a stronger effort to hire faculty for their writing acumen, rather than assigning seminar classes.\nAs the only requirement applicable to all of our university\u2019s undergraduate schools, it\u2019s clear that Penn has identified writing as an essential skill for its students. With an education system already struggling to effectively teach writing, colleges have a responsibility to ensure their students can confidently produce written content for any professional situation. As it stands, Penn is falling short of that benchmark.\n\t\tGet our newsletter, DP Daybreak, delivered to your inbox every weekday morning.I call on our university to reform the instructional methods of writing seminars. The courses we take should be more than formalities of getting a degree. Writing seminars should be the engaging, memorable, and formative educational experience that they are advertised to be.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJACK LAKIS is a College first year studying Political Science from Kennesaw, GA.

          "title": "Jessey Shin | Register NOW, submit by EOD: Seriously, what\u2019s the rush?",
          "article_content": "\u201cIf I don\u2019t get an internship this summer,\u201d I hear someone say on Locust, \u201cI\u2019ll be so far behind. Some people are already recruiting for next summer.\u201d\nOn Canvas, I finally receive the prompt for a reading response that I need to submit in 36 hours. An email notification pops up: It begins with the all-too-familiar \u201cURGENT\u201d and \u201cACTION REQUIRED,\u201d but this, too, will ultimately be buried in my inbox for a good few days until I have the time to go through it. Over time, I began to question the sense of urgency that dominates Penn\u2019s campus, and whether it\u2019s doing more harm than good.\n\t\tThis isn\u2019t a problem exclusive to me. One of my friends has over 10,000 unread emails in her inbox from various departments and clubs with which she is no longer associated. Every so often, I will hear professors and teaching assistants suggest that students start their assignments earlier, and that a significant portion of work was turned in late. At the other end of the classroom, I hear conversations about just how behind and sleep-deprived everyone is amid the barrage of midterms, club interviews, rushing, and job applications.\nIn \u201cConjectures of a Guilty Bystander,\u201d Thomas Merton say, \u201cThe rush and pressure of modern life are a form, perhaps the most common form, of its innate violence. To allow oneself to be carried away by a multitude of conflicting concerns, to surrender to too many demands, to commit oneself to too many projects, to want to help everyone in everything, is to succumb to violence.\u201d\u00a0\n\t\t\t\tSEE MORE FROM JESSEY SHIN:\u201cWhy is your pre-major advisor so much better than mine?\u201dDear Penn, your scooters are mobility aids (sort of)\ufeffAs the overcommitted, overworked high school students we once were, Penn students are intimately familiar with this sense of urgency and obligation. There\u2019s so much to do, always, and these impending tasks are completed at the expense of sleep, rest, and recreation. Instead of attributing this lack of work-life balance to poor time management skills or the need for prioritization, I\u2019d like to suggest a different approach: Just how much of this is really urgent, anyway? How much of this is worth sacrificing our wellbeing over?\nWe labor under the illusion that even inconsequential things must be done immediately. If we miss the opportunity to apply for the position now, we\u2019re letting go of one of the \"greatest\" opportunities of our lives. Not responding to emails in a timely manner is the sign of someone who\u2019s \u201clazy\u201d and \u201cunreliable.\u201d This is perpetuated in our classrooms as well: \u201cMakeups will only be given under extraordinary and documented circumstances.\u201d \u201cEven habitual excused absences will negatively impact your grade.\u201d\n\tI firmly believe that academia, especially institutions like Penn, should be a space for fostering growth and intellectual conversations. How is this achievable, I wonder, if we don\u2019t recognize and accommodate the very real struggles that anyone can come across? Surely, no one wants to experience a death in the family during finals season, but sometimes those are the cards we are dealt. What happens then? Do our deadlines take precedence over our health and our loved ones?\nThe implications of these sentiments can be sinister. They tell us that it is not important to take care of our bodies, listen to our needs, and live in accordance with what is most meaningful to us. Bombarded by constant deadlines, we are pushed to perform day in and day out with no space to reflect and connect with the lofty ambitions we initially came here with.\nWe have the power to reimagine academia \u2014 spaces like Penn are saturated with people who are dedicated to learning, contributing to social change, and becoming an integral part of our communities. However, taking advantage of this also means that everyone needs the time to explore and see their ideas through. Taking a step back from the one-time-only events and assignments piling up on our to-do lists, we are able to devote more resources to our goals and begin to manage our tasks instead of our tasks managing us.\nI truly applaud Penn students for their commitment to success and achievement; however, I would like us to pause and reflect on what we would like to achieve. The narrative of urgency written into our deadlines can motivate us to go further, but it can also disempower us, clouding our ability to take charge of our lives.\nJESSEY SHIN is a College first year studying sociology and communications from Seongnam-si, South Korea.

          "title": "Franklin Li | Just another article on Penn Dining",
          "article_content": "Not a single person on campus seems to be satisfied with Penn Dining. Over the past month, The Daily Pennsylvanian published several pieces that express dissatisfaction. They highlight four problems.\nThe first problem is sanitary issues. Students have reported finding a cockroach, maggot, and glass in their food. It is also no secret that last year, Penn\u2019s dining halls received a total of 100 health code violations, with Hill House and 1920 Commons being outright noncompliant with the general standards set by Philadelphia\u2019s Department of Health.\n\t\tThe second problem is the taste of the food. I acknowledge that taste is a very subjective matter. But when we would rather line up at food trucks on 38th and Spruce streets than eat at dining halls and have several dozens of unused swipes at the end of semester, something must be wrong.\nThe third problem is the food being too pricey. A small box with nine pieces of sushi or two normal-sized buns from the cafe at McClelland costs one swipe, which is equivalent to at least $10, depending on the dining plan. Penn admitted that eating off campus costs less than it does on campus, and some expressed that it is difficult to feel full living only on the dining plan.\n\t\t\t\tSEE MORE FROM FRANKLIN LI:Rethinking College sector requirementsWhy awarding a posthumous diploma to architect Lin Huiyin is important\ufeffThe fourth problem is the limited operating hours of dining halls. On regular weekdays, though they do not give us 7:30 a.m. to 12 a.m. dining hall access like some schools do, the hours cover most of the normal eating times. Choices become more limited during weekends and over breaks. Brunch opens at 9 a.m. on weekends and is only provided at Hill House and Commons. Over spring break, Hill House was the only non-retail dining hall that opened.\nThe problems are clear and simple. But after years of complaints, nothing has changed (well, except for the annual increase in meal plan prices). And I believe nothing will change in the near future \u2014 no truly viable solution exists to Penn\u2019s dining hall dissatisfaction.\n\tWhat are some practical solutions to address dining hall problems? Eliminating the dining plan requirement for first-year and sophomore students would definitely be one. When students do not need to pay Penn a lump sum at the start of the semester, their decision on where to eat will be purely based on taste and price. If Penn Dining makes no improvements, students will either eat out or cook on their own, and dining hall revenues will tumble.\nAnother possibility is to have two or more food contractors. Competition gives the dining halls an incentive to improve their food quality and lower prices to attract students. If they do not, again, they will face revenue contraction. Essentially, the more affordable choices students have, the better Penn\u2019s dining services will be.\nBut none of these changes will probably ever happen. No school administrator would want to cut the flow of profit from dining plans. No food contractor would sign a contract with Penn knowing that it faces competition from another food contractor. And why would Penn double the cost of food contractors? There is no financial rationale for improving students\u2019 dining experience, and no matter how many more articles we write on \u201cPenn should improve its dining services,\u201d we still have to wake up the next morning and use our swipes.\nSo will we be forever stuck with Penn\u2019s unsatisfactory dining halls, at least for the first two years? Unfortunately, I would say yes. Unless we are willing to pay for the meal plans but not eat at dining halls, or we actually find Penn\u2019s dining satisfactory, we will need to look forward to life as an upperclassman.\nFRANKLIN LI is a College first year from Beijing, China.

          "article_content": "Upon my acceptance to Penn a couple of years back, I was overwhelmed by an abundance of snooty comments and remarks relating to the city of Philadelphia, sentiments I could not visualize or understand. \u201cHave fun in Filthadelphia!\u201d or \u201cDon\u2019t get shot!\u201d often followed the congrats I received from most people. Not having had a proper vision of Philadelphia\u2019s layout or culture, I soon fell victim to my peers' alarming warnings and became rather cautious and overly attentive in my first weeks as a Quaker. Of course, the University alerts about various armed robberies or the occasional escaped prisoner did not help this berated city\u2019s case.\nWhile Philadelphia does have its safety hazards and concerning instances, I\u2019ve learned that just may be the price of living in a big city \u2014 the sixth biggest in the nation, in fact. Not to fluff up the real and present dangers, but it also should be said that Philadelphia is not much more dangerous than living in San Francisco, Chicago, or Miami, all of which are regarded as highly attractive places to live.\u00a0\n\t\tMany Penn students, coming from places of privilege and very comfortable livelihoods, are quick to harp on and nitpick at Philadelphia\u2019s imperfections. Jokes are constantly made about living in Philadelphia, comparing it to a punishment or drag. Most students are eager to move out, with their eyes set on New York City or Washington D.C., completely blind to the bevy of opportunities offered right here in Philadelphia. What many Penn students seem to overlook is the fact that Philadelphia is an esteemed, bustling, and charming city that many people dream of moving to and working in. Sure, Philadelphia is no tropical paradise, but it serves its purpose as a solid, spiffing city with so much to offer.\u00a0\nSo, instead of joining my peers in badgering on the City of Brotherly Love, I\u2019d like to take this time to highlight the best parts about living in Philadelphia, and hopefully convince you that we are extremely lucky to be going to school in such a vibrant and lively city.\u00a0\n\t\t\t\tSEE MORE FROM SOSE HOVANNISIAN:Penn students deserve more time off from their corporate-style academic calendarsThe pedagogic power of InstagramThe first thing that comes to mind when family or friends ask what I love about Philadelphia is, more often than not, the incredible food scene. Almost every restaurant, cafe, and quick lunch spot I have tried has wowed me, and I\u2019d like to say that that\u2019s a lot coming from a Los Angeles native! Just last year, Philadelphia won four titles in the James Beard Awards, whose prestige can be compared to \u201cthe Oscars, but for food.\u201d Beyond the bevy of choices we have near campus in University City, there are countless hidden gems and highly acclaimed restaurants in Rittenhouse, Fishtown, Northern Liberties, Manayunk, and more. Philadelphia is known for its diversity, and its countless cuisines are here to prove it. \u00a0\nPhiladelphia\u2019s finest cheesesteaks and soft pretzels are great, and they\u2019re best when eaten in the stands of one of the city\u2019s stadiums. Philadelphians beam with pride every time the Phillies, Eagles, Flyers, and 76ers play. Living in a city with this much athletic pride is not only great for our college experience, but it\u2019s also just a good time. Being able to go to these games, engage in the city\u2019s love for the teams, and enjoy city-wide celebrations is something we\u2019re very lucky to have at Penn, where school-wide athletic spirit is low.\u00a0\n\tEven if you\u2019re not one to appreciate sports, you can easily be one to appreciate Philadelphia\u2019s teams in a different way, perhaps by admiring one of the big Phillies murals on the Walnut Street walk to Center City. Philadelphia\u2019s streets are decorated with many murals and public art, coloring the city and demonstrating civic engagement through the expressions of many local artists. What\u2019s more, Philadelphia also offers many outlets to enjoy fine arts, whether it's through a day spent at the Philadelphia Museum of Art or a night at one of its many popular jazz clubs. Last year, Philadelphia was named the Public Art Capital of America, and the Best City in America for Street Art. And to top these accolades, Philadelphia is constantly celebrated for its memorialized history.\nNamed the Nation's First World Heritage City, Philadelphia is also known as the birthplace of the United States. In a city with a history so rich, every building, street, and alleyway has a story worth telling. Independence Hall, Benjamin Franklin, and the Liberty Bell all make this city the perfect historical backdrop for college students, offering countless opportunities to engage with the legacy of this country\u2019s founding fathers and their work. In particular, Philadelphia\u2019s long history of Black trials and tribulations is a key feature of the city\u2019s development. What\u2019s more, Philadelphia has grown into an unbelievably diverse city, boasting a great range of racial, socioeconomic, cultural, sexual, and religious representation. \u00a0\nWhile I have only touched upon some of the things that make Philadelphia so great, every Penn student has the opportunity to explore this big city and discover its many wonders for themselves. Penn\u2019s location, being right across the bridge from Center City, gives all able students the opportunity to just take a brisk walk out of the Penn Bubble and enter a realm of possibilities, opportunities, and new experiences. And for those of you who would rather not get on your feet, the city can just as easily be explored with the comprehensive and convenient SEPTA system.\u00a0\nI call on each and every one of you to take a moment the next time you\u2019re about to bash Philadelphia and consider the validity of what you\u2019re about to say, while also acknowledging our privilege of being here. Learn to love this city, for we know it loves you!\nSOSE HOVANNISIAN is a College sophomore majoring in communications and minoring in history and consumer psychology from Los Angeles, Calif.

          "title": "Kaynath Chowdhury | I am pro-ChatGPT",
          "article_content": "I support the use of ChatGPT.\nA statement that, said aloud, would garner me sidelong stares despite the website\u2019s appearance in many lecture halls.\n\t\tThe use of ChatGPT has raised much debate among students and become a topic of considerable contention. Similarly, many professors hold polarizing views, as the use of generative AI has been harshly rejected in some classrooms while others have tentative policies supporting its usage. The limitation of emerging technology in educational spaces should raise alarm bells, as we are rejecting tools that could be invaluable for facilitating learning. \u00a0\nTo be clear, I am against academic dishonesty, and I haven\u2019t used ChatGPT in a duplicitous manner. However, saying that ChatGPT is synonymous with academic misconduct is a remarkably weighty statement. I do assent that some individuals could use ChatGPT in an academically dishonest way, such as employing it to write papers in their stead. But, a similar result could be accomplished via other online tools, like Google. Just recently, we have become privy to accusations of plagiarism by former Harvard President Claudine Gay, revealing how this is not solely a ChatGPT issue. Thus, our viewpoint of the perpetrator should be reframed, delegating the fault to the person, not the tool.\n\t\t\n\t\nWith the release of GPT-4, many professors and students alike need to reconsider its benefits. Professors already recommend YouTube for content help, so why not ChatGPT?\nChatGPT can be a remarkable asset that provides an advantage to disadvantaged students. Since many Penn students come into university with a deep background in their chosen field of study, which they gained from their access to prep schools or private tutors, the bridge between these two groups is substantial. ChatGPT provides a way to somewhat balance the playing field.\n\tFor one, GPT-4\u2019s added feature of uploading PDFs makes it ridiculously simple to ask questions about lecture content, at any time of the day, while tailoring it to your level of understanding, a skill that many professors and teaching assistants lack. As several professors are utterly immersed in their fields and many TAs have an intuitive grasp of the subject, they are often incapable of making complex topics digestible. Unfortunately, there have been many instances where I gave up on asking questions to avoid receiving a convoluted response.\u00a0\nWith ChatGPT, feedback is immediate, allowing students to reflect on areas of improvement in their work, and providing them with mechanisms to improve over time. Why go through the hassle of setting up TA office hours to ask a simple question when ChatGPT can do it instantaneously?\u00a0\nStudents outside of Penn who do not have access to an educational institution with tutoring facilities also stand to attain so much from receiving academic help from ChatGPT. This is due to its similarity to using online services like Khan Academy, though ChatGPT is much more personalized.\nProfessors who reject the idea of incorporating ChatGPT into classrooms have not considered thinking critically of its beneficial uses. Instead, they are content with adhering to traditional practices, foregoing innovation for comfort. On the other hand, students who are against the usage of AI hold themselves to a higher standard for not relying on outside sources \u2014 similar to many Penn students' views of receiving academic help through services like Weingarten tutoring or office hours. For many, receiving outside help is equated to a lack of intelligence. As with the many Penn students of privileged backgrounds, they do not require additional help and thus look down on disadvantaged students who do require these services.\u00a0\n\t\tGet our newsletter, DP Daybreak, delivered to your inbox every weekday morning.In the end, humans are meant to be adaptable and always have been. Rejecting technological advancements accomplishes nothing; rather, it is actively harmful to many students who lose out on such a beneficial tool.\nWith that said, we should all sit to reflect on the valuable uses of ChatGPT.\nKAYNATH CHOWDHURY is a College sophomore studying political science and computer science from Detroit, Mich.

          "title": "Francesco Salamone | Let\u2019s talk about dying!",
          "article_content": "\u201cWhat do your parents do?\u201d someone seriously asked me during Wharton orientation. Fighting my brain's battle between an unforced desire to share and an aversion to the anticipated awkward look, I recognized that I would face a long, interminable moment of apnea trying to explain to the world that I do not have two parents because my dad died. Grief exists, and at Penn, it isolates.\nTo be clear, I do not intend to be a prophet speaking universal truths because loss looks different for everyone, but I hope you will find truth in my words nonetheless. Death is a sensitive topic, not the least because it intertwines with cultural, religious, spiritual, and socioeconomic aspects of our identity. Yet grief is undeniably omnipresent, and Penn is no exception, meaning I am not the first one to write (or talk) about it, nor will I be the last, unfortunately.\n\t\tAlmost 40% of college students have lost a family member or close friend within the last two years. Considering there are 18.58 million college students, that makes us more than 7 million grievers. I guess we are not a minority, are we?\u00a0\nWharton senior Pranavi Karnati lost her father last December after a battle with glioblastoma. She bravely watched him suffer for more than a year and a half, but \u201cdespite the pain he felt, he always managed to make us smile.\u201d She experienced a slower, anticipatory death and described her grief as \u201cisolating.\u201d\n\t\t\t\tSEE MORE FROM FRANCESCO SALAMONE: \ufeffIs Penn about liberal arts or elite jobs?There is no definitively designated place to grieve at Penn. Yes, Student Health and Counseling helps (if you are lucky), but 61% of college counselors in the United States report feeling \u201csomewhat, little, or not comfortable at all\u201d with supporting students primarily on grief. Unlike peer institutions like Princeton that offer grief-focused support groups, Penn lacks such infrastructure. The only comparable program that existed was Actively Move Forward, but it has been inactive since 2019.\nWhat about Philadelphia-based groups? As Karnati shared, before you even get a chance to talk about grief, you may face an identity crisis. \u201cThere are groups for children and groups for adults. What am I? Where are college students supposed to sign up?\u201d\n\tThe result explains why grief feels isolating. Naturally, some prefer to process on their own, but sooner or later, we crave feeling less like an alien and more like we are not the only ones experiencing excruciating pain. And support groups are one easy way to find others who relate.\nOf course, this is only half the problem. Remember, I believe Penn is a detached elite. Having two parents is a privilege: emotionally but interestingly also economically, and substantially so. I cannot blame you for having a privilege you did not choose, but I can and will invite you to reflect on it.\u00a0\nAfter Karnati posted her terrible news, she received several supportive messages: \u201cLmk if you need anything\u201d stood out. She mentioned, \u201cMy loss is making me realize who my true friends really are.\u201d\u00a0\nCan Penn students only support one another through hasty texts with cheap acronyms?\nWe know your \u201cI\u2019m here if you need me\u201d is well-intentioned, but understand that it creates a dilemma by putting the onus of starting the conversation on us, inadvertently burdening the griever even more. The individualistically expeditious culture of Penn is inevitably in direct contrast to the prolonged nonlinear path that grievers experience. At best, Penn students are awkwardly unequipped to support a grieving friend and at worst, fundamentally incapable of slowing down to care and empathize. You can do better.\nLike what? Be present with your friend\u2019s pain, listen with the heart, respect disordered confusion, and discover the gifts of sacred silence over filling words. That is what grief counselor Dr. Alan Wolfelt calls companioning. I wish my friends knew about companionship to ask me about my dad. Ask me what he was like, what he liked to do, what his quirks were. God, just ask me what his name was. When you ask, you are not reminding me that he died (trust me, I know), you are letting me know that you acknowledge that he lived.\nThe truth is I cannot blame them. Part of the matter is institutional and part of it is cultural: Many of us are used to the high school familiarity of knowing at least some family members of our friends. For better or for worse, in college, you are nothing more to others than what you present. And unlike your Canada Goose, you cannot wear your invisible grief when you walk down Locust. What you can wear is a Penn Face and pretend no one died, even with your closest friends, because it is profoundly easier and more tempting than the unfathomable truth.\nSo please, I beg you, next time you come across a griever, think twice before ending the conversation out of discomfort or sending the \u201cI\u2019m here if you need me\u201d text. Think beyond and think deeper. Perhaps take the simplest approach: Sit down with them and see where they will bring you.\n\t\tGet our newsletter, DP Daybreak, delivered to your inbox every weekday morning.If we collectively accept death as a mainstream topic of social dialogue, grief will be easier to handle than to hide. Harvard professor and happiness expert Arthur Brooks says: \u201cGrief does not have to be a private misery and net harm to our lives. We can learn to comprehend it, manage it, and grow from it. And in understanding our own grief, we can help others heal and thrive as well.\u201d\nAfter seven years, I understand my grief, and it is my hope (and Karnati\u2019s recent hope) that these words will help somebody.\nFRANCESCO SALAMONE is a Wharton sophomore from Palermo, Italy.

          "article_content": "This semester, I somehow ended up with four out of my five classes being either directly or indirectly about ethics. As a political science major, I was really excited to take these classes, since whenever people talk about ethics nowadays, it mostly has to do with politics or international relations.\nAt a time when our reality changes so rapidly because of technology, and when we are faced with a number of global challenges, some people have forgotten about the importance of acting morally. Especially at a place like Penn, where everyone seems to be extremely worried about their future and their careers, people often disregard these values when they are caught up by the competitive environment. Because of this, one would think that ethics classes would be extremely beneficial for all, but do they actually contribute to making students more ethical individuals?\n\t\tAccording to my professors, they don\u2019t.\nIn all four ethics classes, my professors started the semester by telling us that ethics classes will not make most of us more ethical. I sat there, listening to all of them, and I just could not understand why they would say something like that. If I wasn\u2019t going to learn anything, what was the point of taking these classes?\n\t\t\t\tSEE MORE FROM ZARA TENA:The urgent need for younger voices in politics\ufeffIt\u2019s okay to be ordinaryThat\u2019s where I was wrong: I have been learning a lot. While perhaps the main goal of ethics classes is not to turn students into more ethical people, they definitely give us the tools we need to critically engage with ethical dilemmas. By taking these classes, I might not become a better person, but they have given me a space where I can explore, discuss, and reflect about where I stand on so many issues and what my beliefs about morality actually are.\nEthics is not a subject that can be forcefully taught through lectures and readings. There is no way that we can sit down for three hours every week and magically become more ethical just because we memorize theories and read long papers written by old white men. The goal of these classes is not to tell us what is \u2018right\u2019 or \u2018wrong,\u2019 \u00a0but to give us the skills to navigate the gray areas in ethical decision making.\n\tThese classes encourage self reflection and personal growth. Even when analyzing big case studies or exploring different theories, students are pushed to question their own values, beliefs, and biases. While this may not guarantee that we will completely transform our moral compasses, the self awareness that comes from these reflections creates a great foundation for understanding why we act the way we do and also invites us to try to understand others.\nThe fact that ethics classes begin with a warning \u2014 that you won\u2019t become more ethical by taking them \u2014 should not stop anyone from giving them a chance. The ability to think critically, understand different values and perspectives, and have the skills to self reflect are essential parts of any college education. They prepare students for the complicated moral dilemmas they might face in their personal and professional lives \u2014 especially when most people at Penn will end up with jobs that are notorious for their ethical scandals!\nZARA TENA is a College sophomore studying political science from Puebla, Mexico.

          "article_content": "How many times have you found yourself in a never-ending cycle of back-and-forth messages, trying to pin down a date for a long overdue catch up with a friend? Every get together begins to feel as if it requires intricate planning and strips away the simplicity of social connection. This routine becomes stifling, lacking spontaneity and authenticity; you\u2019re constrained to coordinating with the same faces in the same places.\u00a0\nThis is what I like to call scheduling fatigue.\u00a0\n\t\tAs a result of this phenomenon, gatherings among friends are beginning to resemble scheduled business meetings, meticulously arranged via tools like When2Meet or synchronized Google Calendars.\nWhile resorting to scheduling may seem like the only viable option to maintain a semblance of social connection, perhaps it's time to embrace the idea of venturing out solo: I\u2019m challenging you to go on an unplanned side quest all by yourself to a third place.\u00a0\n\t\t\t\tMORE FROM LALA MUSTAFA:A nation on defense: Dismantling misinformation against Azerbaijan in the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict\ufeff\ufeffAllow me to explain. Picture the first place as your home and the second as your place of education or work. Now, the third place emerges as a public sphere where individuals congregate, not out of any obligation like in the previously mentioned locations, but, for lack of a more precise term, to simply vibe. It could be the cozy corner of a cafe, a communal park, or even the neighborhood barbershop \u2014 anywhere that\u2019ll allow you to interact with people outside your usual circles.\u00a0\nYet, at many universities like Penn, the concept of a third place seems all but lost as our lives remain restricted to school grounds, causing even our first and second places to converge into one. While spots on campus \u2014 like Stommons, Pret, or the cultural centers in ARCH \u2014 can offer some respite, they often come with the latent pressure of being on the clock. Conversations here revolve around assignments, internships, and the intricacies of Penn culture. The chances of an unexpected encounter dwindle given that most people in attendance will be other Penn students. As we\u2019re cocooned in the Penn bubble, it comes as no surprise that many students spend their four years in Philadelphia without ever fully exploring it.\u00a0\n\tYet, this insulation comes at a cost that extends far beyond what we realize.\u00a0\nIt severs our connection not only from the outside world but also from ourselves. That is, within such limits, our individuality dwindles, reducing us to mere roles influenced by our peers. By excluding ourselves from a wider social sphere, we inhibit opportunities to engage with diverse perspectives, trap ourselves in a cycle of familiarity, and risk leading monotonous lives that pave the way to burnout.\nHowever, in our lives, both intimacy and affiliation with broader communities are essential. While intimacy often stems from our immediate circles, affiliation thrives in third places where spontaneous interactions occur. These spaces facilitate easy contact with new individuals on a regular basis, without the need for prior scheduling. As they consistently offer an opportunity for interaction with others, they end up cultivating the most reliable form of socialization.\u00a0\nSo, if you are keen on exploring new horizons and getting involved in the Philadelphia community, I suggest checking out the many informative articles dedicated to bursting the Penn bubble.\nNevertheless, I want to avoid confining third places to physical locations. They\u2019re more of a mindset, a willingness to embrace spontaneity wherever it may arise. They don't have to be far from campus or require spending money. Instead, third places can be any informal spots you visit \u2014 whether it's your student lounge, the library, or a community center.\u00a0\n\t\tGet our newsletter, DP Daybreak, delivered to your inbox every weekday morning.We often find ourselves caught up in the routines of daily life, clinging to familiar patterns of scheduling and social interaction.

          "title": "Beatriz B\u00e1ez | No closed captioning available",
          "article_content": "Columnist Beatriz B\u00e1ez explains her experience with language fatigue at Penn.On my first day at Penn, I called my father in distress, telling him I needed to move back home and study there as I was going to die alone at this university. My father asked why, and I quickly responded, \u201cI haven\u2019t met anybody in three hours. I have no friends. It\u2019s over for me.\u201d\u00a0\nThat very same night, I went to a New Student Orientation event at Houston Hall. As I nervously paced the floor in my Crocs, I overheard some students speaking Spanish and immediately gravitated toward them. Confessing, \u201cI heard Spanish, and I feel saved,\u201d I ended up meeting three genuine individuals, all from various parts of Latin America. Having arrived in the United States, it felt comforting to hear voices that reminded me of home. This comfort is priceless in such a foreign environment.\n\t\tAll my life, I\u2019ve taken courses in Spanish, spoken Spanish at home, and been berated by my grandmother whenever I spoke too much English. Arriving at Penn, I didn\u2019t anticipate the struggle I would face taking classes taught in English, as I had been lucky enough to have been extensively taught English from a very young age.\nBut speaking in a second language most of the time, even as a fluent speaker, is incredibly draining. Meeting native Spanish speakers at Penn was truly a blessing. However, I have found that some people react adversely to me speaking my primary language. These are not continuous reactions of a high degree, but there have been enough small instances to mark me.\u00a0\n\t\t\t\tMORE ON THIS TOPIC:Students celebrate 40th annual Festival Latinx, honoring Latinx culture on campusLa Casa Latina celebrates 2023 Latinx Heritage Month at PennOn various occasions, I have had Latinx friends say, \u201cLet\u2019s speak English so X person doesn\u2019t feel excluded,\u201d or even resort to English for \u201cconvenience\u201d when we\u2019re alone. For the former, I understand the sentiment. I wouldn\u2019t want someone to be excluded from a conversation in such a way. However, when I\u2019m naturally speaking Spanish, having my speech interpreted as a personal offense is off-putting.\u00a0\nIn one instance, I met a student through a mutual friend on a night out. This friend and I speak fluent Spanish; the person I had just met did not. Throughout the night, I had various conversations with my new acquaintance \u2014 who I found quite amicable \u2014 and my friend. I would naturally speak Spanish with the latter, not thinking much of it. The next morning, my friend told me how the new acquaintance felt I hated them for speaking Spanish in front of them, knowing they didn\u2019t speak the language.\u00a0\n\tI was shocked by the assumption and, in all honesty, a little offended. I found it quite conceited that one would think another person is speaking in their first language to actively exclude them. Speaking in a first language, for me, is purely a relief issue. Although I am fluent in English, after an entire week of speaking it, it can be extremely draining; thus, particularly in a social setting, I don\u2019t want to add to the exhaustion.\u00a0\nIt is more than fine to be curious about what somebody is saying and ask for a translation. However, immediately expressing discomfort upon hearing another language and presuming the other person is talking badly about you is inconsiderate toward them. More often than not, this language switch is for comfort. This was the first of sufficient instances that exposed a pattern in my time at Penn. In another class, I grew close to a few other Spanish-speaking students. One of them continuously suggested we switch back to English for seemingly no valid reason and would reply to any comment of mine in English.\u00a0\nThis harsh reality on campus expands into the club scene. In one instance, a native English speaker attended a club meeting primarily led in Spanish. Within this meeting, if club members asked questions in Spanish, any other members who answered quickly switched to English. Evidently, the intent is to have everybody be able to partake in conversation. However, members within a Spanish-led group should be able to detach from English formalities within club meetings, particularly if the club seeks to embrace Latinx heritage.\u00a0\nSpeaking in my primary language is the greatest manifestation of my culture, particularly since Spanish accents are so diverse throughout Latin America. Having to switch to English not only in academic settings but in seemingly every other sphere of Penn life further disconnects me from the culture I\u2019ve been surrounded by my entire life until now. This applies to any person whose main language isn\u2019t English, not only to Spanish speakers.\u00a0\n\t\tGet our newsletter, DP Daybreak, delivered to your inbox every weekday morning.Penn has students from over 100 countries, with around 19% of the student body being international. If one truly wants to immerse themselves in Penn\u2019s multilingual community, one needs to recognize that a language barrier works both ways. Just as an English speaker may be tired from learning another language, a non-English speaker can be drained from constantly speaking English. It\u2019s crucial to recognize that for the latter, multilingualism surpasses a simple language requirement and spills over to nearly every sector of their life at Penn.\u00a0\nLanguage fatigue is a true reality, especially for individuals who haven\u2019t learned English from a young age. Thus, if somebody within your social group is speaking their first language, which you are not fluent in, it does not give you the right to feel offended or urge them to speak in a tongue you understand. And, if you are a non-native English speaker, as much as you can, \"habla en tu primer idioma y que los dem\u00e1s se ubiquen.\"\nBEATRIZ B\u00c1EZ is a College first year studying mathematics and political science from San Juan, Puerto Rico.

In our instruction at the University of Pennsylvania, we were told to reach for safety and to secure our decadence.

The students I knew have already paid that price for that ticket, and their horizons, on a human level, look bleak.\u00a0\n\t\tPhiladelphia is not a college town.

More than in my time, it is now clear that we, the students, want to be free. The crisis is deepening, and history is accelerating.\n\t\t\n\t\nFewer illusions are possible for the young mind in Philadelphia, which tempers and sharpens it like metal on metal. What the path to whiteness and an invented safety then produces is a delusional and unfree state. My peers, who are banking, coding, and consulting their lives away, are living as prisoners to the choices they\u2019ve made.\u00a0\nAll the beauty, genius, and potential I witnessed when we were young together, freshman year before the vicious teeth of Penn successfully \u201csocialized\u201d most of us, has been wasted, whittled down into dust, and lost. My old friends might have money, but they didn\u2019t manage to save their souls, and some part of them knows this fact \u2014 that they are perishing. We were never meant to become the fools and tools of the mythic America: the one that is superior, war-hungry, greedy, and hypocritical. These choices did their damage. That was an aberration. Now, we are entering a time of correction.\u00a0\n\tWe want to know the meaning of our lives when we live in a country whose hand assassinates a man and poet as beautiful and courageous as Refaat Alareer, when we live in a society in which Aaron Bushnell had to die so that humanity could live. When the youngest students of Philadelphia stand to say they are no different from the children of Palestine, that the bombs dropped abroad also explode in our neighborhoods, we then know it is true for ourselves \u2014 that we bleed the same as these children in Palestine, as all the men and women we encounter in Philadelphia.\u00a0\nOur bondage to the genocide in Gaza is through the struggle to become moral human beings in America, and to relinquish our country from the myths that strangle us and our people.\u00a0\nIt is unmistakable that the education Penn offers is bankrupt, and that some cancer, invisible but detectable, poisons our relationships to each other and to ourselves. The scramble for acceptance into mediocre clubs and fraternities is insufferable, and the false authority these groups stand on in order to make these judgments is embarrassing. Within this sea and storm of immoral standards, the truth and our touchstone live in the broader historic moment \u2014 the crisis we know and the possibilities we see.\u00a0\n\t\tGet our newsletter, DP Daybreak, delivered to your inbox every weekday morning.The real task of Penn students is the same as it always has been: to be present in their lives, in this city, to examine and test the assumptions they have inherited, to develop a coherent worldview that explains the reality before them. To investigate and challenge the standards of their education, peers, and professors. And to then act and live by these new definitions, through which we will discover freedom. The world makes us, and we make it, too.\u00a0\nIf we were meant to become the leaders of this country and makers of history, as so many of us have been told from youth into maturity \u2014 that we are capable of this \u2014 then this is our role to fulfill: a brave, original, and purposeful life that skirts the frontier of new standards for this nation. The choices we make now will decide the fate of this country.\u00a0\nMICHELLE LYU is a 2019 Wharton graduate in statistics.

          "title": "Hanadi Abdulkadir | How poor dining hall food shapes our mental and academic capabilities",
          "article_content": "At this point, many Penn students have lived the terrible dining stories at a number of halls across campus. While it\u2019s important to discuss the health and sanitary risks associated with some of these concerns, it\u2019s also necessary to break down how this problem factors into students\u2019 academic and mental well-being.\u00a0\nOpening Sidechat every few days to see yet another picture of undercooked meat or hearing horror stories from my friends dissuades me from trekking across campus to eat at many of our dining halls. Oftentimes, I find myself skipping meals or stretching the time out between each one \u2014 until I accept the fact that I\u2019ll be eating the same food I already ate a couple times that week. Does this mean that I\u2019m probably missing out on some of the necessary vitamins or fiber I should be getting daily? Probably.\n\t\tNumerous Penn Dining Wellness emails live in our inboxes with tips on improving digestive health and practicing better healthy habits in our daily lives. Additionally, the official page for Penn Dining boasts awards and recognitions for sustainability and top college dining. However, the pristine and glossy promotional pictures of sandwiches, smoothies, and breakfast bowls tell a completely different story from the reality on campus.\nWith two of the most historical repeat offenders \u2014 Hill House and 1920 Commons \u2014 being the only consistent options available for on campus dining during the weekend, it\u2019s much more convenient to resort to the other retail spots scattered around campus. However, some of these locations are far apart, depending on where you live, and can add additional costs to weekly expenses. \u00a0\n\t\t\t\tSEE MORE FROM HANADI ABDULKADIR:\ufeffPenn should require an African American history courseWhy social media and Palestinian activism goes hand in handAdditionally, for students who are dishing out a hefty sum of money to enroll in the dining plan, going out of their way to seek expensive alternatives takes away money that could\u2019ve been better spent elsewhere. Considering that first years and sophomores are required to pick a dining plan for their first two years at Penn, it\u2019s no wonder that students have consistently called for the food standards to match the high prices of these meal swipes. Ideally, no student should feel like they need to resort to options outside of Penn; rather, outside options should be supplemental to an already quality level of options at all dining halls.\u00a0\nSince coming to Penn, my relationship with food has become much more complex. I need to look twice when picking out a seemingly clean utensil to eat whatever is on my plate or stare extra hard at my salad with suspicion before consuming it. But growing up, food was always a way for me to connect with my family and friends, to bring us back together even when we hadn\u2019t seen each other in a long time. Yet the food at Penn, at its worst, has left me frustrated and succeeded at suppressing my appetite \u2014 something I actually can relate to other students about.\n\tAlthough certain foods are scientifically linked to improving mental clarity and focus, I hesitate in reaching for those vegetables because they don\u2019t look as fresh or appetizing when lined up on display in Kings Court English House. As a result, I look for short-term solutions in coffee, which leaves me feeling tired earlier in the day or exhausted while trying to tackle my assignments at night. In order to meet my immediate deadlines, I prioritize some assignments over others, meaning some classes suffer in academic performance and perpetuate an almost never-ending cycle of playing catch-up. I believe that the root cause of all these problems can be traced back to the lack of decent dining.\u00a0\nThis same sentiment has been echoed by many of my friends and peers. But the dining quality at Penn can be mitigated if the University addresses the root problem. Whether that be promoting clean and sanitary workspaces when handling food or streamlining student complaints to Penn Dining other than through email, the University can restore student faith in the system. When it comes to campus dining, Penn can improve upon our experiences by implementing the changes that students deserve to enjoy, especially at the height of midterm season.\nHANADI ABDULKADIR is a College sophomore studying international relations from Philadelphia.

          "article_content": "During Penn\u2019s recent administrative upheaval, the University community found an unexpected silver lining: For the first time, Penn was making headlines alongside Harvard and MIT.\u00a0\nThe presidents of these three institutions were at the center of an infamous congressional hearing in December after their alleged missteps on campus antisemitism. I\u2019ll admit, there is something far more distasteful about chaos at the Capitol than the collective HYPSM prestige.\n\t\tBut many of us are taking our education at Penn for granted, shedding our \u201cque ser\u00e1, ser\u00e1\u201d optimism, and wondering at times what it would be like to go to a more recognizable Ivy. For decades, we\u2019ve all but exhausted our morale by clarifying to passersby that no, Penn State and Penn are not the same university. And yes, Penn is actually active in areas outside of Wharton\u2019s finance programs.\nSo, when Penn Engineering announced its new undergraduate program in artificial intelligence, many of us were enthusiastic about the University\u2019s growing role in the innovation sector: a space thought to be dominated by less business-oriented institutions.\n\t\t\t\tSEE MORE FROM MRITIKA SENTHIL: Removing legacy admissions will align Penn\u2019s actions more closely with its educational missionWhy changing leadership won\u2019t eliminate antisemitism at PennBut Penn\u2019s realization, of possibly its most practical initiative, begs the question: Is the University actually necessary in DevOps? Does sitting in a classroom \u2014 let alone one that\u2019s in the midst of a campus known for its influx of finance bros \u2014 really supersede what can be MacGyvered by a tech junkie with only a laptop, caffeine, and time? I want to give a definite \u201cno.\u201d Otherwise, I would need to hold my classmates and myself accountable for upholding all the exclusivity that comes with attending Penn. And yet, there are a frustrating number of anonymous netizens, D-list journalists, and LinkedIn bards who call Ivy League universities like Penn \u201cout of touch\u201d \u2014 remnants of centuries-old American elitism in an era of bottom-up grassroots movements.\nOne C-suite executive anticipates that \u201cthe best AI engineers and builders won\u2019t graduate Penn Engineering. They'll be global, builders and in the right group chats.\u201d His readers agree, with one commenter further emphasizing that \u201cuniversities cannot keep up with the pace of free market innovation.\u201d When these schools attempt to go against the grain and align with consumer needs, \u201cit genuinely looks embarrassing and out of date.\u201d\n\tIn an environment where the use of AI models is largely democratized, we\u2019re naturally drawn to the trope of a layperson who forgoes bureaucratic systems to channel their intelligence: creating life-changing inventions that would have never come to be under self-serving corporate and political influences. And when ignoring cases of succor \u2014 as mainstream media unfortunately does \u2014 there are many examples of such successes. Bill Gates and Paul Allen, co-founders of Microsoft, were university dropouts. So were Meta Platforms co-founders Mark Zuckerberg and Dustin Moskovitz. As Penn\u2019s over reliance on donors came to light earlier this school year, critics of the upper crust have continued to group Penn with other perpetrators of social stratification. The field of AI is, by nature, continuously evolving. And limiting growth in the discipline to those who can afford, and then succeed in Penn\u2019s Department of Computer and Information Science courses is counterproductive.\nHowever, these narratives misrepresent the intentions of Penn\u2019s AI program.\nTo make a better case for Penn\u2019s AI major, I spoke with Robert Ghrist, Andrea Mitchell Professor and associate dean for undergraduate education at Penn Engineering. He describes how the process of integrating AI in education is similar to the effects of increasing access to music recording and playback technologies. Now, there is \u201cmore music for everyone at much lower prices,\u201d he told me. Nonetheless, \u201cartists at the very top of the industry\u201d are increasingly the benefactors of \u201ca concentration of rewards.\u201d Taylor Swift is, as any current news feed can attest to, perhaps the most prolific embodiment of such phenomena. And professor Ghrist strives to make Penn an incubator of sorts for the \u201cTaylor Swifts of AI\u201d that seek avenues for academic growth, to actually be the \u201cleading edge where the best thrive.\u201d\nAnd to thrive in this discipline, aspiring AI mavens are off course by simply memorizing browser instructions in JavaScript and praying for a tech equivalent of the coveted Goldman Sachs internship. After all, studying AI is a philosophical pursuit: an inquiry into the nature of consciousness and ethics of creating sentient machines. It\u2019s also a political pursuit, for AI poses challenges in regulatory compliance. There are countless possible liabilities for even the most basic ChatGPT input, such as unprotected user data and violations of intellectual property rights. \u00a0\n\t\tGet our newsletter, DP Daybreak, delivered to your inbox every weekday morning.Needless to say, as you might have noticed in my earlier columns, I am not an AI major. I\u2019m not even enrolled in Penn Engineering. Am I, of all students, in the right to quash critics of the Penn AI major when I dropped AP Computer Science in high school (with no regrets)?\nYet, it\u2019s clearly irresponsible to follow the well-intentioned advice from tech capitalists when constant innovation is not particularly ideal for society. Maybe I\u2019m just afraid of a \"Black Mirror\"-esque dystopia, but there is a kind of ominous quality to the idea of highly skilled AI scientists off the reins. Penn, however, is cultivating an ecosystem that nurtures AI talent, albeit not by stifling the next Elon Musk or Sam Altman with red-tape-ridden academics; instead, Penn fosters ethically conscious innovation that addresses complex societal challenges. And so, the fact that I can engage with the Penn curricula across departments has a surprising beauty. The opportunity to become a part of this technological movement \u2014 or, dare I say, revolution \u2014 is the gift of studying AI at Penn.\nMRITIKA SENTHIL is a first year studying management and Russian and east European studies from Columbia, S.C.

          "title": "Akiva Berkowitz | An AI major by any other name ",
          "article_content": "Artificial intelligence is a topic we can\u2019t seem to get enough of. From frequent announcements regarding policies within classrooms to endless professors and visiting scholars weighing in on the unprecedented effect large language models will have on our lives, I\u2019m sure we\u2019ve all discussed to death how revolutionary ChatGPT has become for college students.\u00a0\nMany of us have even had the chance to firmly establish positions on whether the University should embrace the technology wholeheartedly or put in place safeguards to prevent it from eroding the value of a college education, but up until now, the vast majority of conversations have been on a non-technical level.\n\t\tThat all potentially changed in this past month when Penn announced their first Bachelor of Science in Engineering in AI. Thankfully for us, Penn has chosen to launch this interdisciplinary degree at the \u201coptimal time\u201d to \u201ccreate a society where AI isn\u2019t just a tool, but a fundamental force for good to advance society.\u201d But at what cost? To what extent should we be using college as an opportunity to hyperfocus on not just a certain field (computer science), but a field within a field? Majoring in AI panders to the pre-professionalism Penn is known for and removes many of the foundational elements of the field that underlie innovation.\u00a0\nIn an interesting recent LinkedIn post, David Magerman pondered the implications of a university building complete undergraduate curriculums around a \u201cmodern business tool that is a niche application of computer science, diverting students away from a broad education in computer science.\u201d He went on to ask pointedly, \u201cWhat's next? A Bachelor of Arts in Blogging from the Annenberg School? A Wharton BS in Quantitative Trading?\u201d\n\t\t\t\tSEE MORE FROM AKIVA BERKOWITZ:The newsletter is dead\ufeffIsrael under attack: What do you stand for?As a current computer science major, I\u2019ll admit the AI curriculum looks fascinating. There is such an array of eye-catching electives (from Deep Generative Models to Natural Language Processing) that, if I were doing my degree all over again, I suspect I would have been swayed to switch into the major. But as a recently graduated computer and information science friend put it, the degree \u201cseems like the cool parts of CIS\u201d without the heavier basics like operating systems, computer systems, and physics \u2014 building blocks on the entire computer domain. \u00a0\nThe question I ask myself is whether artificial intelligence is really enough of an independent field that it transcends computer science and necessitates its own major. Is the relatively new field of AI established enough, broad enough, and unique enough such that the skills we gain through taking just those mostly career-focused courses today will undoubtedly remain relevant in 30 years and justify the $84,600 a year sticker price? I simply wonder how likely it may be that AI will become so unrecognizable in 20 or even 10 years, given its breakneck pace of innovation, that students may have wished that their majors in college focused on more fundamental elements of the field that innovators keep turning back to for insight.\u00a0\n\tAside from long-term career effectiveness an AI degree would have compared to computer science or electrical engineering, Penn is known for its pre-professional student body, and this new major shows signs of that sentiment leaking into the curriculum as well. In contrast to the Penn Integrates Knowledge professorships that bring in academic leaders who deeply understand multiple fields to better spark insight between them, this new major filters various courses of study to pluck out the elements we find valuable today.\u00a0\nIn this line of thinking, maybe we should consider the true value of a groundbreaking Wharton degree in quant trading that would promise to \u201csculpt the financial moguls of tomorrow\u201d with unparalleled prowess in algorithmic trading strategies and quantitative analysis.\u00a0\nAll this is to say, I immediately understand the value the current AI concentration within the larger CIS curriculum has. And I appreciate the Ph.D. programs that take students to a higher level of understanding, once they\u2019ve taken the time in their undergraduate training to build the broad foundations. I simply remain curious of the true value an AI undergraduate degree offers us as students over other forms of study within the field and the certain level of indulgence in pre-professionalism that it plays into on Penn\u2019s campus. I truly hope that I\u2019m proven wrong.\nAKIVA BERKOWITZ is an Engineering junior studying computer science from Silver Spring, Md.

          "article_content": "As busy college students, most of us do not have time to cook our own meals, and if you are anything like me, cooking is far from your forte. The hassle of having to go to the grocery store, cook, and clean can be time consuming and even more difficult when you\u2019re overwhelmed with classes, clubs, and homework. For the many students without access to a kitchen in their dorm, this presents an even bigger challenge. Luckily, college campuses have dining halls! Students simply swipe their card to get access to an all-you-care-to-eat dining experience. Dining halls provide easy access meals to students\u2014but what happens when that food is inedible?\nAs a picky eater, I know that simply because I do not like a dish does not mean it is unsafe to eat, but food with cockroaches and glass is unsafe for anyone. A seemingly obvious underlying assumption in dining is that food is safe to eat. College dining halls should be a place where students go to eat well-cooked, hairless, and insect-free food. However, that is not the case at Penn: There is a lack of responsibility to make sure the food is meeting basic standards for, let alone satisfying, all students.\u00a0\n\t\tMeal plans are far from cheap. For the sticker price, students would expect quality food, but they would be wrong. Both of the first-year student meal plan options cost $6,330, with the maximum amount of swipes being 296. Each meal swipe equates to roughly $17, which is about the same price as a Caniac Combo at Raising Cane's. As previously stated, Penn dining hall food is far from gourmet, and its price is too high for the quality delivered.\u00a0\nExpensive dining plan meals are not unique to Penn, but other Ivy League schools have similar prices for better quality food. Cornell University offers an unlimited meal plan, so students may visit the dining halls as much as they want with a fixed cost of $6,942 for food ranked second-best in the nation. So, for roughly 600 more dollars, Cornell students have access to unlimited meals and substantially better quality dining.\u00a0\n\t\t\t\tSEE MORE FROM ERIC NAJERA: \ufeffWe should be grateful to attend PennPenn clubs should have an assigned faculty member\ufeffAside from price and quality, weekend dining is another struggle. With the popular McClelland Sushi & Market and Houston Market being closed on Saturdays and the other dining halls closing at 8 p.m., food options are limited. Late-night study sessions means having to resort to local food places that remain open, and unlike nearby schools such as Drexel, our dining dollars do not work at off-campus restaurants and out-of-pocket money spent on takeout can add up quickly.\nBefore every school break, Sidechat is flooded with posts of excitement for home-cooked meals. In my classes, when asked what we are excited for, most students reply being able to eat good food. It is not uncommon for college students to miss their home-cooked meals, but when students are excited to actually eat food that is not served alongside insects, it signifies a problem.\n\tWith Penn\u2019s Bon App\u00e9tit contract still in place, we may not know how much Penn can do to change the dining experience. Safe, clean food should not be an unreasonable expectation. In order to enhance a student's experience outside the classroom, Penn must budget for an edible food experience for all students.\nERIC NAJERA is a College sophomore studying history from Rolling Meadows, Ill.

          "article_content": "We all know the typical \u201ctypes\u201d of high schoolers, the different clich\u00e9s: Where are my nerds at? But, another attribute of student groups that has become increasingly relevant in the 21st century United States is the diverse ethnic makeup of its population. And, frankly, do we as a campus mirror all that comes with that national trend of diversity?\nThink of the friends with whom you often hang out. Then, ask those friends with whom they usually go out. Finally, think of the groups you are a part of, the extracurriculars in which you partake. Notice a pattern?\n\t\t\u201c[D]espite increased opportunity to live and work in mixed-race settings, Americans remain racially segregated in their friendship patterns,\u201d a study published by the National Institutes of Health found. \u201cSpatial racism, cultural encapsulation, and personal choice are contributing factors for patterns of same-race friendships.\u201d\u00a0\nThis pattern seems to reflect the divisions present in Penn\u2019s social scene as well. Despite coming from all sorts of backgrounds across the world, the University\u2019s students appear to have unconsciously adopted a policy of self segregation. In other words, we like to \u201cstick to our own\u201d by socializing with others to whom we relate to on a cultural, ethnic, or religious basis. So, regardless of Penn\u2019s efforts to integrate people of differing experiences and beliefs, there still remains a degree of resistance by individuals themselves to cross those racial or cultural lines.\n\t\t\n\t\nAs a result, the potential for diversity of thought is threatened. A narrow mindset develops within these groups that students pledge to, and they effectively act as echo chambers that exacerbate already crippling political polarization. We relate to each other less, rely on our \u201cown\u201d more, and become less tolerant of the views, and thus experiences, of those who do not necessarily look, think, or speak like us.\nThis kind of thinking \u2014 whether manifested in the form of race, religion, or otherwise \u2014 has led to serious tension at times and enabled a distorted view of certain communities and how they experience Penn. I attribute part of that thinking not to the identity groups we are a part of, but to how much we value them over who we are as individuals.\n\tHomogenous communities definitely have their place in the college experience: They help ease our transition when we first arrive at Penn, and their role cannot be replaced. I say this as an international student myself, who had a hard time acclimating to an entirely different culture and, most radically, diet. Nonetheless, we should treat these organizations as an aid to finding belonging on campus, not a substitute for individual thought and expression.\nHowever, none of this means individuals can\u2019t agree or always need to separate themselves from the group. The use of a large, collective voice can benefit our campus much more than we realize. What is important to note is that there lies a clear distinction between acknowledging the views of others and forcing ourselves to accept those views for the sake of conformity.\nThere is nothing wrong with disagreeing with the majority, whether it is one against two or one against a nation (though some may try to tell you otherwise). As long as you are respectful and driven by a desire to learn rather than defend, there are no limits on what perspective you may question. So, challenge your beliefs, reevaluate your viewpoint, challenge that of others (no matter who they are), and then reevaluate yourself again. It\u2019ll be hard at first, to express your precise, genuine thoughts without fear. But, remember that you\u2019re not alone (I struggle sometimes myself) and that it\u2019s a process you won\u2019t always get right.\n\t\tGet our newsletter, DP Daybreak, delivered to your inbox every weekday morning.The hardest part of breaking out of groupthink, after realizing it, is talking about it. My advice? Take the plunge and never look back. The next time you are in a group and the majority agrees with an idea you don\u2019t like, let it be known. Talk about it and explain why you think the way you do. Don\u2019t worry if some get offended or others simply do not agree; it is normal and, in fact, expected.\u00a0\nNever forget that disputes you engage in are an opportunity, not a challenge, and our differences are enlightening, not threatening. Only then will we begin to understand and appreciate each other more as unique actors in a truly historic community.\nZAID ALSUBAIEI is a College first year studying economics from Al-Khobar, Saudi Arabia.

          "article_content": "I downloaded Sidechat this fall after my friends sent me too many screenshots of funny memes or jokes posted on the anonymous app. I figured that doing so would simply remove the middleman. I was already being exposed to the same jokes, memes, comments and judgements as those on the app anyway \u2026 right?\u00a0\nIn December, I returned home for reading days and fell into an easy pattern of studying. Nothing I did was wildly exciting or social, but I instead found myself enjoying the routine and satisfaction of productivity. During my study breaks, I would scroll on Sidechat \u2014 and from the comfort of my home, I felt myself spiraling into anxious dread about returning to Penn. Each time I opened the app, I was faced with a barrage of posts all echoing the same sentiment: Penn is awful and depressing. Without a second thought, I accepted those posts as fact, and in doing so, I allowed Sidechat to have more power than it deserves. In other words, I subscribed to the complaining culture that is pervasive on Sidechat.\u00a0\n\t\tUsing Sidechat, especially without intentional thought, is a way of looking at Penn through hypercritical glasses. Perhaps this is because negativity has been normalized and cynicism gets more upvotes. To some extent, this pessimistic messaging is diluted with the insertion of mildly entertaining memes or jokes, but the result is still the same. With each scroll, Sidechat is perpetuating a defeatist perspective of Penn.\u00a0\nSo, I arrived back at Penn to take my final exam: openly unhappy about returning to what I thought would be a bleak campus as a result of discourse on Sidechat. But to my surprise, it was not horrific, and I was able to enjoy my weekend of studying just as I had my week at home. The sheer volume of disheartening posts on Sidechat had clouded my perspective and ability to see the best in the situation. Sure, I was becoming one with a Huntsman GSR while others were at home enjoying break, but on the other hand, I was with my friends and able to have a sleepy campus all to myself.\n\t\t\t\tAs is the case with most other social media platforms, Sidechat is consumed passively and without a second thought \u2014 it\u2019s used to pass time, curb boredom, and satiate our addictions to our phones. And yet, students are absorbing and internalizing content more quickly than they can truly digest it.\u00a0\nGiven the bandwagon culture on Sidechat, users often build off of one another, creating a chaotic, and often dismal, echo chamber that does not truly represent life at Penn. Whether or not college is the best four years of your life, it is at least what you make of it, and Sidechat enables students to feel like victims of an unknown cause. For those who are actually struggling, Sidechat acts not as a productive outlet, but rather as a meta ether that provides no remedy other than the satisfaction that others are unhappy too.\u00a0\n\tSince winter break, I have in fact deleted Sidechat and am all the better for it. I still get sent the best and the brightest jokes by my friends, but I am no longer overwhelmed by unsolicited complaints on an hourly basis. Without Sidechat, my thoughts on the housing lottery, the floods in the Quad, and upcoming midterms are completely my own.

          "title": "Cathy Li and Liala Sofi | History can\u2019t repeat itself; stand with Chinatown",
          "article_content": "Students for the Preservation of Chinatown protested outside the Board of Trustees meeting held at the Inn at Penn on Mar. 3, 2023. \nA few weeks ago, the streets of Chinatown came to life with firecrackers and lion dances ringing in the year of the dragon. As you walk through the brightly colored 40-foot paifang \u2014 known to most as Chinatown\u2019s Friendship Gate \u2014 you enter into a cultural oasis that has stood strong in the heart of Philadelphia for nearly 150 years. Beyond this fixture, Chinatown serves as a home to nearly 3,000 residents and numerous family-owned businesses, restaurants, shops, and community organizations. Whether you are going to Ken\u2019s Seafood Restaurant for a fun night out or Heng Fa for groceries, Chinatown feels like home.\u00a0\nUnfortunately, this community has been under constant attack for decades and is once again facing the threat of displacement and gentrification from a plan to develop an arena for the Philadelphia 76ers merely a block away. We firmly stand with the Students for the Preservation of Chinatown and urge you to do the same. \u00a0\n\t\tSince the early 1900s, Chinatown has been a victim of gentrification often driven by predatory infrastructure projects. In 1932, the construction of subway infrastructure at Ridge and Eighth streets \u2014 and the subsequent development of the Vine Street Expressway from 1957 to 1991 \u2014 resulted in the destruction of buildings and severe divisions within the community. Bringing in noise and pollution, the expressway eroded neighborhoods and people's quality of life. This was not Chinatown's sole battle, however, as it also faced multiple proposals of developments for a federal prison in 1992, a baseball stadium in 2000, and a casino in 2008.\u00a0\nThe story of Philadelphia's Chinatown mirrors other Chinatowns across the nation. Amid the 1994 fiscal crisis in Washington, D.C., then-Washington Wizards owner Abe Pollin negotiated a deal for the downtown Capital One Arena, where the city covered pre-development costs to acquire and demolish properties. Entrepreneurs in Washington's Chinatown voiced concerns about prices of real estate skyrocketing and parking impacts on businesses in the area. A decade later, most Chinese residents were forced to move out due to unaffordable housing. The parking shortage led to the closure of the last Chinese grocery store, accelerating the decline of the Chinese American population in the area to fewer than 400 residents today. Ironically, as D.C.\u2019s arena now relocates to the suburbs, the community is left behind, having endured irreversible destruction while in the midst of its recovery from the pandemic.\u00a0\n\t\t\t\tMORE FROM LIALA SOFI AND CATHY LI:Liala Sofi | The hypocrisy of billionaire philanthropistsCathy Li | Philadelphia\u2019s changing tastesIn New York\u2019s Chinatown, threats of displacement and economic insecurity also loom high. In 2021, the Museum of Chinese in America accepted a donation of $35 million in support of a borough-based jail complex which would displace Chinese American working-class people in the area. On top of that, its board executives were connected to the closing of the last unionized restaurant, beloved Jing Fong banquet hall, and construction of luxury towers that are actively raising rent and real estate taxes in the area.\nIn Philadelphia, the current 76Place project is being developed by 76 DevCo, an initiative by 76ers managing partners Josh Harris, David Blitzer, and David Adelman. Adelman is at the forefront of the construction of the arena and has promised not to displace the residents or businesses in Chinatown, but his past actions speak louder than his current words. Adelman works closely with Brett Altman, who also owns the University City Townhomes, and was a key figure behind the demolition and end of affordable housing in the West Philadelphia area that was previously known as the \"Black Bottom.\u201d This constant cycle of displacing residents and communities that have lived in the area for generations must end, and we must be the voice to make this happen.\n\tDevelopers of the project have stated that the arena will \u201cserve as a model for an equitable & inclusive community,\u201d yet there is not a single mention of Chinatown in the proposal. Efforts to ensure communities can benefit from this project read as empty promises when nearly 95% of residents, business owners, and visitors oppose the arena\u2019s construction.\nMany questions posed by residents have also gone unanswered by 76 DevCo. How will restaurants and small businesses in the surrounding area be protected? Who will clean the streets after huge events?\u00a0\nPreserving Philadelphia's architectural heritage demands careful consideration in urban development, but the development of the arena does the exact opposite \u2014 jeopardizing accessible low-income and senior housing complexes, healthcare clinics, and schools for children.\nPenn has direct ties to the developers in the area, and students should be cognizant of the situation. Adelman currently sits on Penn Medicine Board of Trustees and is the CEO of Campus Apartments, which houses many Penn students off-campus. But more importantly, Penn students are directly and indirectly involved in the Chinatown community, whether that be Penn Lions performing all throughout the city for Lunar New Year, or student groups like SPOC organizing initiatives to honor traditions celebrating the multi-ethnic communities that reside there.\u00a0\nDespite what greedy developers may suggest, Chinatown is not an ethnic theme park but a home. It\u2019s more than just a place to eat, it\u2019s a support network and a cultural hub for immigrants and visitors alike.\nIn the face of ongoing threats, Chinatown has demonstrated remarkable resilience and activism, advocating for the needs of all diverse communities of color that are integrated into the cultural fabric of our city. The next time you are in Chinatown, take a look around at all the place has to offer. Venture into Ebisu for some home decor and enjoy a Mochinut donut as you shop. Come by Dae Bak for soul-nourishing Korean barbecue. The opportunities to support your favorite restaurants and local businesses are endless.\nPlease don't turn a blind eye to what is happening outside the Penn bubble. Pay attention to what SPOC and other organizers are doing in the fight for the preservation of Chinatown. Educate yourself on what is going on in Chinatowns across the country. If you can, participate in programming like Crane Chinatown Community Center art exhibitions or Show Your Love for Chinatown events to learn more about the challenges facing the neighborhood. Sign petitions. \u00a0\nAdorned with dragon motifs, and gorgeous ornamental roof tiles, the Friendship Archway is not only an architectural masterpiece, but a labor of love \u2014\u00a0created for community by community. The engineers and artisans from Tianjin, China \u2014 Philadelphia\u2019s sister city \u2014 came together with residents and the city of Philadelphia to fund and invest in Chinatown, and you should too.\u00a0\nThe next time you walk through the gate, remember that the fight for Philadelphia\u2019s Chinatown, and Chinatowns everywhere, is not over. Speak up and fight for the movement so that history does not repeat itself.\nMore resources:\nGoFundMe for Ginger Arts Center\nAsian Arts Initiative\nGet our newsletter, DP Daybreak, delivered to your inbox every weekday morning.Youth Against Displacement\nLIALA SOFI is a College junior from Roanoke, Va.

          "title": "Caroline Magdolen | \u201cEveryone cheats.\u201d What can we do about it?",
          "article_content": "My guess is that nearly everyone reading this article knows someone who has been academically disingenuous, or been that someone before. Being academically dishonest isn\u2019t all about flashy examples, like the two admitted Penn students accused of plagiarism and fabricating data in 2022. There are smaller violations that may feel less egregious, or even harmless, like querying ChatGPT for help completing your homework, peeking at a friend\u2019s lab assignment, or answering a PollEverywhere as if you\u2019re in class, when really, you\u2019re snoozing in your dorm.\nAcademic dishonesty is having a moment in the spotlight. The advent of generative AI, the use of which cannot be reliably detected by grading softwares, will likely upend student learning for better or worse. At the same time, examples of plagiarism by prominent academics are being dug up left and right. The former president of Harvard, Claudine Gay, was ousted in part due to plagiarism concerns, and Business Insider found that former MIT professor Neri Oxman (the wife of billionaire Bill Ackman, who led the campaign against Gay) \u201cstole sentences and whole paragraphs from Wikipedia, other scholars and technical documents in her academic writing.\u201d\n\t\tTo be clear, I believe that academic dishonesty at Penn \u2014 going against community standards that your professor has explicitly outlined \u2014 is unacceptable, and that we should be doing more to penalize and prevent it.\nNevertheless, we must also acknowledge that academic dishonesty is understandable, in that we can piece together students\u2019 rationales when they do cheat, and even sympathize with them in some cases.\n\t\t\t\tSEE MORE FROM CAROLINE MAGDOLEN:\ufeffThe Rat Kings of PennThere\u2019s no better time for climate education\ufeffTo dissuade academic dishonesty, we employ sayings like, \u201cIt will only hurt you in the long run to cheat,\u201d or \u201cYou\u2019re taking advantage of other students who've completed their work fairly.\u201d This is true in some circumstances. If you\u2019re an aspiring quant and you\u2019re asking ChatGPT to calculate all of the derivatives on your MATH 1400 homework, it\u2019s going to show: First in your exams for the class, then in every math class you take thereafter, and especially in your future career. And if MATH 1400 is curved, your dishonest success capitalizes on the honest failures of others \u2014 not cool.\nBut this is not true in all cases. Jane* was a first year in her spring term when she was taking CIS 1210: Data Structures and Algorithms \u2014 a famously challenging CIS course \u2014 with Rajiv Gandhi, a famously challenging professor.\u00a0\n\tShe cheated on her coding assignment late into the semester, and as per the professor\u2019s policy, received a -300/100 on the submitted homework and zeros on all previously submitted homework, receiving a D as her final grade in the course.\nBut Jane believes that what is more important to her story is not what happened, but why it happened.\u00a0\n\u201cWhat drove me to make a bad decision? Why are [these classes] so infamous? It\u2019s because of notorious policies where you cannot collaborate on many assignments. You are given long problem sets to do, on your own, each week, with desperate students in office hour queues that are two to four hours long. Many times, you will go to the TA and not get a clear answer. It is a profoundly isolating situation, particularly for freshmen just entering college, and that\u2019s what drives well-meaning people to cheat.\u201d\nBased on my conversation with Jane, it seemed that she felt isolated at the time and was struggling to reach out for the support that she needed, both in CIS 1210 and at Penn as a whole. And given the limited support Jane could receive from TAs and her instructor, backtracking her friend\u2019s code felt more conducive to her learning than doing nothing.\nJane expressed a lot of remorse over what happened, and said that she still has a lot of respect for Rajiv, maintaining a good relationship with him to this day. She was also grateful that Rajiv was willing to handle this internally, since a low grade in the class looks better than a formal statement on her transcript, detailing her violation of academic integrity.\n\u201cI deserved to be punished harshly,\u201d Jane said. \u201cBut the collaboration policies of these introductory courses, and the punishment I received, wrecked my self-esteem and my early college experience. I felt that there was no way out.\u201d\nAccording to Jane, Rajiv's philosophy is to \"let go of your grades early: the sooner you stop caring about your GPA and start caring about learning, the better.\" She agrees with this philosophy, especially since he curves his courses generously, but sees this as out of touch with the realities of many Penn students.\nAfter students have prioritized perfecting their grades and resumes (and have been praised for it) in high school, those habits won\u2019t get undone overnight. Even at Penn, there are many institutions and accolades that continue to reward \u201cperfect\u201d performance over pursuing difficult academic disciplines, experimenting, and invariably messing up sometimes.\nFrankly, for a pre-med student in computer science (a track which Jane was considering at the time), the adage that \u201ccheating will hurt you in the long run\u201d skill-wise doesn\u2019t hold much water. The skillset of a future doctor and a software engineer just don\u2019t overlap enough. What can hurt a pre-med in the long run is a low GPA.\nAnd while there are some students for whom projects, internships, and technical interviews will get them a lot further in guaranteeing their success, this is not true for everyone. For many preprofessional students who may want to challenge themselves with a major or minor in CIS, they risk getting shut out of the study altogether.\nWhat frustrates me most about this entire situation is not that such harsh action was taken, but that it appears ineffective in tackling the issue at hand. If a student wanted to cheat, they could just take CIS 1600 or CIS 1210 during a different semester, when a different instructor was in charge and penalties were anecdotally known for being less harsh.\nWhile Jane\u2019s actions were clearly wrong, I can\u2019t help thinking that she was just the unlucky example that had to face the music, and she said as much in our interview: \u201cEveryone cheats in this class. You don\u2019t survive [CIS 1600 or CIS 1210] without talking to people, it just depends on whether you get caught. That doesn\u2019t make cheating okay, but it does mean that we need to rethink how these courses operate.\u201d\nSo, what can we do so that not everyone cheats?\nThis is a complex question, and there is no easy answer. It is crucial that as we frame the issue of academic integrity violations, we look at both the violations themselves and the root motivations that drive them \u2014 these actions are not taking place in a vacuum.\u00a0\nAcademic integrity violations these days are, to an extent, simply easier to commit. ChatGPT has led to a surge in \u201cunfair advantage\u201d violations. And even before generative AI, the pandemic had uprooted our usual test-taking environment. Now that classes are in person again, we no longer need to have take-home or open-Internet exams, but these still persist in some classes, and are easier to cheat on. Penn, given its history of fraudulent alumni, isn\u2019t going to be a place where professors can blindly trust students to refrain from cheating when presented with the option, so professors should take some responsibility for leveling the playing field in the classroom too.\u00a0\nJulie Nettleton, the executive director of Penn\u2019s Center for Community Standards and Accountability (CSA), relayed over email that CSA already works closely with schools and centralized resources at Penn to discuss how to proctor exams, and with faculty to discuss exams, syllabi language, and classroom policies.\nWhat constitutes a violation itself is currently not standard across classes, or even across different sections of the same class. How to handle a concern of academic integrity falls to the professor first \u2014 this is how Jane completed CIS 1210 with a lower grade, rather than a formal sanction from the CSA. It makes sense to delegate this responsibility to professors: It is more efficient than having the CSA handle every case, and professors should have the freedom to decide what constitutes cheating in their classrooms.\nHowever, this does open the door to students deliberately choosing sections of a course with professors that have more relaxed academic integrity policies. Conversely, some professors can be overly harsh, to the point where they are acting unfairly towards their students.\u00a0\nJill*, another student that I interviewed for this article, was falsely accused by her professor of collaborating on her final exam with her peers. At the start of winter break, the professor sent a class-wide email imploring those who worked together on the take-home exam to turn themselves in or have the matter escalated. Jill recalls that for students that turned themselves in, the professor lowered their grades accordingly \u2014 everyone else was reported to the CSA.\nIn the end, Jill\u2019s name was cleared, but she was assigned a case manager that seemed to have assumed she was guilty by default. As the case progressed, many of the details that the professor used to build the case against her appeared superfluous \u2014 for example, she and her friends had all rounded to the same decimal place in their work. Jill suspects that the escalation may have been personal: she had previously asked the professor, on behalf of the class, if he could make changes to his teaching style to facilitate learning.\nIt seems wrong to me that a professor could accuse a student and cause such extensive stress when in the end, Jill turned out to be innocent. It reminded me of some other methods that professors use to catch students cheating, such as Turnitin\u2019s flawed AI detector.\nPart of the solution to rampant academic dishonesty may also lie in expanding our vocabulary to discuss the issue, as John McWhorter pointed out in The New York Times. A class-wide cheating ring, direct plagiarism of original ideas from a paper as one\u2019s own, and copying a line of someone\u2019s code all constitute academic dishonesty, but range broadly in terms of severity and \u201cease of catching.\u201d However, this is rarely reflected in academic integrity policies.\u00a0\nIt can be awkward to suggest that some forms of dishonesty are worse than others, and more awkward still to draw the line between different punishments for different violations, but we must still have these conversations.\u00a0\nWhat should constitute dishonesty at all? When speaking with Jane, she would often circle back to how isolating it was to work alone on her assignments as a first year in introductory computer science courses, particularly as a woman in STEM. Every day, she would walk out of class \u201cfeeling way worse about [her]self.\u201d Now exploring chemistry, physics, and biology courses, she greatly appreciates the change in her academic environment, where students are encouraged to openly collaborate. The grade medians in chemistry are similar to those in CIS (which is to say, not great), but Jane is not as stressed as she was in CIS 1210, since she studies with her friends, and they can struggle and ask for help together.\u00a0\nWhile it was dishonest of Jane to copy code when it was against CIS 1210 policy, perhaps CIS majors and minors would learn more from the course if they were in a more collaborative environment to begin with. Jane has suggested that CIS 1210 should find a middle ground where students can learn from each other, but not be overly reliant on collaboration to perform well on exams.\u00a0\nShe also argues that there should be more opportunities for students to admit to academic dishonesty \u2014 through a friend at Stanford, she heard that at the end of a computer science class, students can select the assignments they have cheated on and receive a negative score on them, or risk facing more uncertain penalties if they are later caught.\u00a0\n\u201cThis policy gives people a second chance to do the right thing, and I do believe that you learn from an experience if you own up to it,\u201d Jane said.\nDeliberations over how best to address academic dishonesty can go on without end, but unfortunately this column must do just that.

          "title": "Jack Lakis | What we can learn from Penn\u2019s college ranking",
          "article_content": "Last fall, a plethora of new results from U.S. News & World Report, Wall Street Journal, and Forbes elevated Penn in their national college rankings. Nearly every list places Penn among the top 10, some going as far as placing the University among the top five. This universal growth resulted from a key change in most of these sources\u2019 metrics: greater consideration given to postgraduate salaries.\nPenn famously has one of the highest-earning alumni bodies in the country. Starting salaries for Penn graduates are often considered the highest in the Ivy League. By mid-career, the average Penn alum is raking in $165,000 annually, while the national average for a college graduate caps out at $74,000.\n\t\tPenn draws a great deal of prestige from its potential to produce high earners, which is a direct result of our school\u2019s preprofessional culture. Nearly 50% of all Penn graduates enter one of two career fields: consulting or finance. This pipeline allows most Penn alumni to matriculate into high-paying jobs shortly after graduation.\nI\u2019m usually a defender of preprofessionalism. It\u2019s crucial that Penn graduates are able to find good jobs, and high salary potential is an immense advantage. But those jobs aren\u2019t everything. Many universities are making gains in rankings and name recognition based on alumni outcomes in public service careers.\n\t\t\t\t\ufeffSEE MORE FROM JACK LAKIS:\ufeffDo we all hate Penn?Staying focused after Magill's resignation\ufeffFor example, Harvard University boasts about its eight presidential alumni. However, when 1968 Wharton graduate Donald Trump was elected president, Penn mostly ignored his history with the school. Given his proximity to controversy and his unconventional political history, Penn\u2019s bump in prestige was limited by Trump\u2019s election. Our second closest claim to the White House is the University\u2019s relationship with President Joe Biden and the opening of the Penn Biden Center. I argue that this is as far as Penn\u2019s ties to the presidency will go. Nowadays, Penn\u2019s laser focus on professional development might repel students who will one day have presidential potential.\nComparable institutions to Penn have high-earning graduates and prestigious placements throughout the government, nonprofit sector, and the advocacy space. For example, Georgetown University feeds graduates into congressional offices and many Fulbright programs. Princeton University also regularly features its flashy roster of graduates in powerful political offices. These universities maintain a strong presence in the private sector but are also actively represented in government positions.\n\tIn these examples, the institution itself sponsors an undergraduate school dedicated to public service. At Georgetown, it\u2019s the School of Foreign Service, while at Princeton the role is filled by the School of Public and International Affairs.\nI propose that Penn follow suit and create a fifth undergraduate school dedicated to public affairs. This new school could absorb Penn\u2019s wildly popular social science programs, like PPE (Philosophy, Politics and Economics), Political Science, and Economics. Currently, most students in these majors are scooped up by consulting firms and investment banks. If these students were given an intentional focus on service and social responsibility, perhaps they could feel empowered to use their degrees in a more meaningful way.\nThe least Penn can do is expand its current effort to bridge the gap between social science degree seekers and careers in government and nonprofits. It\u2019s crucial that our student body actively engages with the robust policy infrastructure that Penn has already made available: Civic House, Perry World House, opportunities like Penn in Washington, and extracurricular engagements offered by the Government and Politics Association. From what I\u2019ve seen, these resources are underutilized at Penn. By snubbing them, Penn students are working against the general interests of the University to gain prestige.\n\t\tGet our newsletter, DP Daybreak, delivered to your inbox every weekday morning.Besides, it's about more than just rankings. We have the potential to empower our students to become leaders in society. TIME Magazine ranks Penn as the third-best college for aspiring leaders. However, the article states its rationale for this placement as a concentration of graduates in business careers. Other chart-topping schools on this list were noted for their programs in law, medicine, and more.\nUltimately, private sector homogeneity marks one of Penn\u2019s key weaknesses. As we move forward, Penn has a duty to educate leaders in more than one field. If Penn strengthened its programs in civic engagement, more graduates would be inclined to pursue roles in government and could elevate Penn\u2019s cultural stature. We should be known for more than salaries. We can do more than business.\nJACK LAKIS is a College first year studying political science from Kennesaw, Ga.

          "title": "Mia Vesely | Black Penn is vibrant this month and every month",
          "article_content": "As of late, most of my columns have focused on things I take issue with: Whether it\u2019s Liz Magill\u2019s resignation and the threats to free speech on campus, or the lack of racial diversity in Panhellenic sororities. I haven't highlighted the things that I truly appreciate and, more specifically, the places in which I\u2019ve found community at Penn.\nLast February, I argued that Black history is important for everyone. Education surrounding Black people, their lives, and their contributions should be integrated into the standard curriculum. Black Penn shows up and shows out every month, but this month in particular, there are many events and ways that Penn student organizations uplift the community and come together.\u00a0\n\t\tIt would be impossible to touch on all of these amazing events and their impacts, but I\u2019d like to paint a picture of some of these groups and their initiatives during this month and beyond. Planning for these events takes months. For example, when Descendants of Afro-Americans at Penn (DAAP) \u2014 a club founded just last year \u2014 put on their first-ever gala on Feb. 1 to kick off the month, you better believe that the event was well-planned and executed.\u00a0\nThe gala \u2014 Red Carpet For A Cause \u2014 supported the Sickle Cell Disease Association of America's Philadelphia and Delaware Valley Chapter. The night included catered food, live performances from student groups like The Inspiration, wonderful community, and beautiful decor\u2014even including an ice sculpture of the DAAP logo. Over $1,700 was raised in support of the foundation.\n\t\t\t\tSEE MORE FROM MIA VESELY:\ufeffI dropped sorority rush and I\u2019m gladFirst Liz Magill, next free speechWhen asked about the impacts of the event, College sophomore and DAAP founding member Clarke Dickens said, \u201cWe wanted to bring the community together for a great cause, especially a cause that affects a lot of African Americans and Black people more broadly.\u201d\nSickle cell disease occurs in about one in every 365 Black babies born in the United States. The percentage of Black people who carry the trait is even higher, with one in 13 Black babies being born as carriers.\n\tDickens is not just involved with DAAP, but is also on the boards for QBlack and Shea Collective.\nThese clubs are all part of something commonly dubbed \u201cBlack Penn,\u201d which focuses on so many different aspects of identity. From cultural organizations like Penn African Student Association (PASA), to preprofessional organizations like Black Wharton and the Black Pre-Law Association (BPLA), to community service organizations like the NAACP, all of these organizations put an emphasis on service both inside the Penn community and out.\u00a0\nFor example, Campus Curlz \u2014 a club I serve on the board of \u2014 is, at first glance, a club centered around uplifting natural hair and embracing positivity. \u00a0But underlying hair mask making events and movie nights, there is a strong commitment to service. Just this month, the community service committee held an event where we made Valentine\u2019s Day cards for senior citizens at Mercy Life West Philadelphia.\nService by board members is a requirement to be part of funding organizations like UMOJA \u2014 the umbrella funding organization for Black clubs \u2014 and even beyond that, many clubs center service in every activity they partake in. Whether you\u2019re on the board of a club or not, there are many service opportunities available and encouraged.\nWhen asked what they wish people knew about Black Penn, Dickens said, \u201cClubs should make an effort to include grad students, it makes all the difference. I\u2019m able to say, \u2018This is what I would look like coming here for grad school,\u2019 and it can even offer opportunities for mentorship.\u201d\nWhat seems to drive Black Penn is first and foremost the students, then the supportive and involved faculty, as well as the local partnerships and opportunities the clubs find, build, and pursue for themselves. Many members of the DAAP board are native to Philadelphia, so that makes their work even more personal.\nWhile Black students do take initiative to realize what they need and create the spaces they want to see, there is so much room for improvement on behalf of Penn: whether it\u2019s stratifying the way funding is given to these clubs \u2014 they often can\u2019t fund silverware in UMOJA meetings if it can be provided elsewhere \u2014 or improving the cultural spaces available to students (we were promised the ARCH \u2018building,\u2019 not the ARCH \u2018basement\u2019). In months like February, Penn aims to spotlight their Black students. I just wish this recognition of the incredible community Black students forged for themselves, when they initially didn\u2019t see it on campus, came year-round.\n\t\tGet our newsletter, DP Daybreak, delivered to your inbox every weekday morning.Events like DAAP's gala happen every month, and it\u2019s important not to understate the role these organizations play in making Penn a welcoming and accepting place for students from marginalized backgrounds.\nI was happy to see Faces of Black Penn \u2014 a Black-run publication \u2014 highlighted in the DP last week. I hope people continue to uplift the work of these student groups going forward and make space to give all students their roses. Black History Month is not over, and the time to appreciate Black students and their work does not end come March.\nMIA VESELY is a College sophomore studying philosophy, politics, and economics from Phoenix, A.Z.

          "article_content": "If you\u2019re reading this self-serving trip down memory lane, you might be one of my friends and family. Or, more likely, you\u2019re trying to read about the encampment and got lost on The Daily Pennsylvanian\u2019s website.\nIf you\u2019re in the latter camp, just hit the menu button on the top left and go to news. And if you\u2019re reading this in the physical paper \u2026 Who am I kidding, nobody actually picks up one of those. But if you\u2019re one of my friends and family, I\u2019m going to tell a story you might have already heard. Bear with me.\n\t\tWhile I was sports editor, a group of us made the seven-hour commute to Hanover, N.H., to cover a football game at Dartmouth College. At the time, we did a \u201cPicks are In\u201d column, where we\u2019d predict each week\u2019s game. All but one of our writers picked Dartmouth, who were 11.5-point favorites.\u00a0\nCut to: Penn somehow wins in double overtime, I\u2019m in the process of writing what will become an extremely mediocre recap, and we\u2019re sitting in a nearly empty press conference waiting to speak to Penn\u2019s coach.\n\t\t\n\t\nOne of us eventually asked him, \u201cWhat message do you think this win sends to the rest of the Ivy League?\u201d While staring directly at us, he said, \u201cI don\u2019t think anyone gave us a chance today... People were writing stories without giving us Quakers a chance. So message: We are 3-0, ready to play another game next week.\u201d\u00a0\nI checked. We were the only ones that had written a word about this game.\n\tWe, a group of 20-year-olds, had published something that pissed off a Division I football coach, and when we were proven wrong, he rightly told us to our faces.\nIt was completely fair for him \u2014 who, I should mention, is a very nice guy \u2014 to call us out. And it gets at a key aspect of college sports journalism: It can be very bizarre.\u00a0\nOne time, I was covering a road football game from my room. I watched the game on TV, and a buddy of mine came in and watched with me. With 10 minutes to go, we were talking about a Penn running back that was tearing through Cornell\u2019s defense.\n\u201cOh yeah,\u201d I said. \u201cI'll probably talk to him.\u201d\nI was on the phone with the running back a little over 10 minutes later. As my friend sat bemused on my couch, the guy who just charged through linemen on my TV was on the phone with me so I could mumble disjointed questions at him.\nAgain, bizarre.\nFormer Sports Editor Brandon Pride and I once traveled to New York for a baseball series at Columbia University. In the second game of the series, Penn blew a six-run lead in the last couple innings and lost on a walk-off homer.\nRough way to lose. And rough for Brandon and me, who now had to talk to the coach about their collapse.\u00a0\nWe waited as the team emerged from the dugout, terrified of having to confront a coach whose team just lost in the worst way imaginable. As he came out, we told him who we were, and he quickly exclaimed, \u201cOh wow, thanks for coming out, guys!\u201d and couldn\u2019t have been any nicer.\nYou never know what to expect from the people you\u2019re interviewing. Like how you don\u2019t expect Rick Pitino to tell you and the rest of a cramped postgame press conference about how the NCAA got its comeuppance in his infamous \u201cladies of the night\u201d investigation.\nBut that\u2019s part of what makes this very specific brand of journalism so great, and the memories I have from it are some of the best from my time in college.\nAfter that Dartmouth game, we drove 45 minutes in the middle of the night to a place called \u201cD Acres Permaculture Farm & Educational Homestead.\u201d\nIf that sounds like it\u2019s not a luxury hotel, you would be correct. I\u2019d waited till the last couple days before our trip to book a hotel. Much to my surprise, it was Family Weekend at Dartmouth, which meant that all the hotels in Hanover were full. The only one available was D Acres, located more or less in the middle of nowhere.\u00a0\nIt was cheap, so D Acres had that going for it.\nWe drove up around midnight to what looked like a haunted house, unsure if we\u2019d end up sleeping in the car. To our surprise, it was actually quite nice. The room next to the kitchen was for butchering pigs, and you needed to pay with quarters to shower. But the beds were comfy, and we weren\u2019t in a tent like the website suggested we might be.\nFor less than $60 a person, it was a good value. Plus, like many trips, it was a night with friends that I\u2019ll never forget.\n\n\n\n\n                Photos courtesy of Matthew Frank\n      \n\n\nI\u2019ve written over 120 articles for the DP (yikes), and although a couple of those were actually pretty good, it\u2019s the memories and the friends that I\u2019ll be most proud of and thankful for about my time in DPOSTM (The DP\u2019s Only Section That Matters, for the uninformed).\nI\u2019m thankful for the guys on Sunday Shift\u2122, for being the only reason I\u2019d ever wake up before noon on a Sunday. And Jonah and the other non-DPOSTMites who made late nights in the office not so miserable.\u00a0\n\t\tGet our newsletter, DP Daybreak, delivered to your inbox every weekday morning.I\u2019m appreciative of my non-DP friends, for constantly putting up with my \u201cSorry, I can\u2019t.

          "title": "Fiona Miller | Ambitions, amnesia, and ambivalence",
          "article_content": "When senior spring rolled around, a warning email from Career Advising landed in my inbox. URGENT. Apparently, my current enrollments would not complete my degree requirements. Apparently, I wouldn\u2019t graduate. As always, procrastination came back to bite me.\n\u201cSocial Impact and Responsibility: Foundations\u201d: the last class I needed to complete my concentration. As the name suggests, the course was meant to be entry-level, taken at the beginning of my academic journey, not at the tail end. Every semester, I pushed this three-hour seminar off. I could push it off no longer.\n\t\tAfter an email with my advisor, who not-so-politely suggested that I should have planned my course load better, I finally enrolled in Social Impact Foundations during my senior spring. A three-hour seminar, a foundations course as a senior \u2014 I couldn\u2019t wait.\nThe first assignment for the cursed course \u2014 which, due to my late enrollment, would be submitted well past the due date \u2014 was a legacy paper. In 2050, when you look back at your life (both personal and professional) what will you consider to be your main achievement \u2014 your legacy?\u00a0\nTo some, this assignment would kindly be referred to as easy and unkindly referred to as busy work. To a senior soon to be facing the real world, legacy was terrifying. All that mattered was what immediately lied in front of me: graduating, getting a job, getting into law school. I was too young to think about myself at age 48, and it was way too early to cement my legacy.\nLegacy? So terrified by this word, I had actually enrolled in and immediately dropped this course a year prior. Now, I was backed into a corner and forced to face my legacy head-on. I debated dropping my concentration entirely, but that meant admitting defeat to my concentration advisor. So I stayed in the course, mostly out of stubbornness and partly out of spite.\u00a0\n\tI began thinking back to the dreams I wrote about in my college application. Who was I when I came here?\nAt 18, I told my dad I wasn\u2019t applying to Penn. Why bother if there was no chance I would get in? In southwest Virginia, most of my peers would stay in-state or head down to Southeastern Conference schools. No one from my area had been to Penn in recent years; Philadelphia was a strange new land.\u00a0\nMy dad disagreed. Spoken like a recreational soccer coach, he replied: \u201cYou miss 100% of the shots you don\u2019t take.\u201d The what-ifs loomed too large to brush off. Hours before the deadline, I submitted my Wharton application. When decision day rolled around, my family and I jumped up and down in excitement \u2014 not over an acceptance, but over a spot on the waitlist. My shot in the dark was met with a wait and see, a more favorable outcome than a rejection. By a mix of luck, chance, and the rise of COVID-19 gap years, I was ultimately accepted. And with the payment of my deposit, Pandora\u2019s box was opened.\nAt 18, I knew all the numbers about Penn: rankings, post-graduate outcomes, CU limits, and course requirements. Over time, numbers became my litmus test. Numbers assured me I was on the right track. Apply for five clubs, like everyone else. Apply for dozens and dozens of internships, like everyone else. Stop sleeping eight hours a night \u2014 no one else does.\nEach year, the numbers told me there was more I could do. Another club, another leadership position, a more challenging minor, a more challenging career. Each NSO, I felt like Sisyphus, with any progress I made erased by another tick of the clock. The numbers stretched on. Better to have two internship offers than one, better to have three leadership positions than two, better to have four A\u2019s than three A minuses\u2026\u00a0\nLiving by the numbers was no way to live. Constantly comparing myself to my successful classmates was productive to no one and crippling to myself. At some point \u2014 far too late in my college career \u2014 I stopped trying to fit a standard I didn\u2019t believe in. Far too late, I resuscitated my ambitions from amnesia.\u00a0\nFlashing forward, I returned to the legacy paper. I knew the sources of my unhappiness at Penn. I knew I hated the numbers, the never-ending comparisons. Most importantly, I knew who I didn\u2019t want to be. For now, that could be enough. I wrote the legacy paper. I stayed in the three-hour seminar. I will graduate with the concentration that I applied to Penn with.\u00a0\n\t\tGet our newsletter, DP Daybreak, delivered to your inbox every weekday morning.As seniors know, much of spring term is reminiscing and remembering: thinking back to first-year roommates, old friend groups, long-abandoned majors and minors, and pre-professional tracks. The legacy paper, the bane of my existence, forced me to look both backwards and forwards. The assignment made me face uncomfortable questions of \u201cWhat does success mean to you?\u201d and \u201cWho even are you, really?\u201d\u00a0\nLike most seniors, I don\u2019t really know the answers. I am graduating with a degree that claims I know something when really, I feel more confused than I did at 18. But if four years at Penn has taught me anything, it\u2019s this: Comparison is truly the thief of joy. The only thing comparison has taught me is who I don\u2019t want to be.\u00a0\nFIONA MILLER is a Wharton senior studying behavioral economics and social impact from Roanoke, Va.

          "article_content": "\u201c5 Fun Things To Do in Philadelphia,\u201d read the subject line of my most recent email.\u00a0\nSitting in my childhood bedroom back in 2020, I curiously pondered over this random email that landed in my inbox. With no connection to the city, I didn\u2019t understand why this was relevant to me. I almost ignored it, if not for my superwoman of a mother who reminded me that I was still on Penn\u2019s waitlist. I had previously concluded that Penn was no longer a possibility, but thankfully, my mom urged me to check the portal anyway.\u00a0\n\t\tMy screen was adorned with red and blue confetti \u2014 I had, in fact, been accepted to Penn. After re-reading the acceptance letter about 15 times to make sure my eyes were not deceiving me, my heart sank when I noticed the date. I was accepted over a week prior, but I had no idea because I missed the original email notification.\u00a0\nIf I had not seen the subsequent email advertising Philadelphia\u2019s main attractions, I may have missed the deadline to make an enrollment decision, or I may have never even known that I got into Penn. I was so grateful to still have the chance to attend this prestigious university despite being so irresponsible, and I made a promise to take advantage of every opportunity this school offered.\u00a0\n\t\t\n\t\nAnd that I did.\u00a0\nMy Penn experience has been nothing short of fulfilling. Though my first year was characterized by measures of isolation (virtual classes, mandatory masks, grab-and-go dining), I had never felt more connected with others. Call it trauma bonding, but there is something unifying about being a \u201cCOVID freshman\u201d that only the Class of 2024 could ever understand.\n\tMy first year was also the time when I joined The Daily Pennsylvanian as an opinion columnist, and over the next four years, I would write, edit, podcast, and even create crossword puzzles. I learned how to navigate ruthless backlash from readers attacking my character and my intellect, and I served as a deputy editor during one of the most polarizing times in DP history \u2014 two formative experiences that have shaped who I am as a person and a writer. I credit the DP for planting the seeds of my future in journalism, and I would not have had the privilege of working for NBC News, CNN, and ABC News without my roots here.\u00a0\nAside from the career benefits, writing for the DP also presented opportunities to unravel years of internalized racism. My articles about Asian hate and xenophobia in Congress may not seem significant to the average reader, but this represented a huge step forward in not only accepting my racial identity, but being proud to publicly defend it. Coming from a predominantly white neighborhood and high school, I never truly felt comfortable in my own skin and even cringed at my culture. I am ashamed to admit this now, but I sought to assimilate by subconsciously surrounding myself with white friends, American cuisine, and white norms.\u00a0\nWhile this may sound like an absurd paradox, joining a sorority further prompted me to embrace my Asian identity. I began to see Asian women engaging in social endeavors and being welcomed in spaces that I had previously assumed were exclusive to white individuals. And though Greek life undoubtedly has a litany of faults in regards to diversity and inclusion, I do credit Penn\u2019s chapter of Alpha Phi for providing my first friendships with girls that actually looked like me. I have had some of the deepest conversations with these women regarding shared backgrounds, childhood similarities, and generational differences \u2014 topics that I never even fathomed to touch on beforehand.\u00a0\nThese social interactions remain my most treasured takeaway from college. Of course, all the sweaty frat basements, overpriced downtown events, and BYO dinners are core memories in my Penn experience. But rather than reminiscing about these drunken nights, I am more proud of the friendships that these social outings have rewarded me with. I have met my best friends that know me better than I know myself, some of whom I would quite literally consider to be family. I have learned about love and loyalty, support and sacrifice, trauma and tragedy.\nMy friends have also inspired me in a myriad of ways, and I\u2019ll never tire of watching them launch companies, save lives, and change the world. They dedicate their hearts and souls to every endeavor, including athletics, the arts, and other extracurricular activities. In fact, witnessing my peers\u2019 passions has served to revitalize my own. As a competitive figure skater for over 12 years who suffered from burnout and grew to despise the sport, I refused to step foot on the ice again. Though I joined the Penn Figure Skating Club during the fall of my first year, it was not until senior spring (seven semesters later) that I visited the Penn Ice Rink for the very first time. I regret how long it has taken, but it has been a beautiful journey receiving such profound support and falling back in love with the sport that defined me for over a decade.\u00a0\n\t\tGet our newsletter, DP Daybreak, delivered to your inbox every weekday morning.I could go on and on about the many things that Penn has taught me, but my mind always goes back to the day I discovered my Penn acceptance and the panic that ensued after realizing I opened the letter a week late. I often think about how different my life would have been had I continued to neglect my inbox, and I always come to the same conclusion: none of these experiences would have been the same, and many of these life lessons may have never come to fruition.\u00a0\nSo if there\u2019s one piece of advice I have to give, it is to check your email. One email could change the entire trajectory of your life, just as mine did.\u00a0\nEMILY CHANG is a College senior studying communication and law & society from Holmdel, N.J.

          "article_content": "Opinion applications for The Daily Pennsylvanian were due on a rainy, pandemic-era September day. Zoning out in a Zoom lecture, I wondered if I really wanted to put the effort into penning a sample column. Wouldn\u2019t I just get rejected?\nBut then I remembered what Mr. Henderson, my high school English teacher, wrote to me that spring. He said he associated me with the newspaper, complimenting my writing style and how I gave my all on every assignment. If at least one person thought that I belonged at the paper, I may as well give it my best shot.\u00a0\n\t\tIt\u2019s a pretty solid call to adventure, don\u2019t you think?\nWhen I started writing columns, I was scared stiff of saying something that would get construed the wrong way. I reviewed every last letter and punctuation mark of my drafts, and asked my friends to do the same. With that diligence, I grew as a writer. I started speaking up in meetings, and then, in my junior year, I led them as the opinion editor.\u00a0\n\t\t\n\t\nFor the longest time, I chose to interpret my time at Penn, and at the DP, as a kind of hero\u2019s journey, where I finish demanding assignments with aplomb, and every adversity teaches me a valuable lesson. Most of us do some version of that. We hope to graduate feeling triumphant, having risen through the ranks and gained expertise in the activities and academics that we invested in. We hope that our next steps involve a dream job or school \u2014 a dream life, even.\nI entered Penn my senior fall, eager to get my storybook resolution come graduation. Leaving my summer internship with glowing reviews from my mentors, I was assured of a return offer. And having made a pact with my friends to take no more than 5.5 CUs, I would be coasting, relative to my earlier 6.5 and 7 CU terms as a dual-degree student. This was the term where, instead of learning the ropes of Penn and fighting to stay afloat, I would explore and navigate new waters.\u00a0\n\tBut then, as the clock struck midnight and September began, my email inbox greeted me with a \u201cwe regret to inform you\u201d message from the company I had interned at \u2014 the first of many, many eventful emails in my inbox. I dropped down to 4.5 CUs after struggling with a coding assignment for 20-something hours, but my workload hardly let up after that.\nOver the following months, 30 and 40-hour weeks at the DP became my norm: speaking with our (incredibly, insanely dedicated) staffers and editing and fact-checking columns. I was hopping on phone calls and writing replies to email chains, dozens of messages deep in the middle of the night. By the end of the year, Opinion published over 200 staff and guest columns with diverse perspectives on campus life and current events \u2014 there is nothing I am prouder of having worked on at Penn.\nNone of it would have been possible without the immense support and kindness from so many wonderful, driven people. Thank you Emi, Imran, and Jesse \u2014 in the most tumultuous of times in the Pink Palace, I could count on you to advocate for Opinion and to give your all into leading the DP, which means more than words can express. Thank you Yomi, Vinay, and Emily for being the absolute best deputy editors Opinion 139 could ask for, and Matteo, for your careful sensitivity reading and suggestions. Thank you Derek, Benjamin, and all of Photo and Design for the beautiful doms, and for goofing off with me during production nights. Thank you Allyson, Julia, and all of Copy! You are the backbone of the DP.\nAnd of course, I am most grateful for the wit, enthusiasm, and commitment of every single columnist I have had the privilege to work with; your stories captivated thousands of minds and inspired countless debates.\nIf I was still going after that storybook resolution, I\u2019d tell you that upon retirement from the DP, I rode off into the sunset to some magnificent end-credits-style music. At our banquet, I was honored to receive the Editor of the Year award, and after applying to full-time positions for months, I suddenly had to decide between three great job offers over the span of two weeks.\nBut it\u2019s not all that simple \u2014 I\u2019ve learned this spring that 5.5 CUs can feel just as soul-sucking as 7 (thanks, NETS 2120), and I\u2019ve had my fair share of tough conversations, embarrassing slip-ups, and everyday misfortunes. With the turmoil and tensions both on campus and worldwide right now, it feels disingenuous to tell a story where everything wraps up neatly, with no loose ends.\nI said before that in a hero\u2019s journey, each adversity teaches you a lesson \u2014 but that\u2019s not how life actually works. Sometimes, you just screw up, for no reason other than bad luck or a bout of clumsiness. Sometimes, there\u2019s no purpose to it: only pain.\nBecause of that, I\u2019ve given up on the hero\u2019s journey altogether. Shifting away from grandiose but precarious narratives that hinge on external validation, like acceptances and awards, I now prefer to focus my story on the day-to-day minutiae that bring me joy and stability. It is filled with lovely little moments, like chatting with my roommates over spicy, piping-hot bowls of instant ramen, or taking in the fresh air and ambiance as I walk through the Woodlands.\u00a0\n\t\tGet our newsletter, DP Daybreak, delivered to your inbox every weekday morning.My life feels far fuller with this type of story than when I\u2019ve tried to contort my time at Penn into a narrative with some meaningful conclusion to it all. I have flourished in many ways here. But in others, I am very much a work-in-progress, and that\u2019s perfectly fine. I hope that you will come to adapt your stories as you grow and change too \u2014 sticking with a rigid narrative for too long is no fun.\nI suppose I\u2019ll end here on the same line that got me into this whole (glorious) mess in hopes that it inspires somebody else: whoever you are, if you so desire, you can belong at the paper. Start writing stories, and never stop. Be curious and skeptical about every narrative you examine \u2014 ask lots of questions and raise objections when you see fit. You\u2019re going to be brilliant.\nCAROLINE MAGDOLEN is a College and Engineering senior studying earth science and systems engineering from New York City.

          "title": "Riane Lumer | The social clock is ticking, according to who?",
          "article_content": "Five years ago during a college tour trip, I vividly recall sitting in a hotel, gazing out the window at the skyline of Boston. I felt inspired; I was eager to write my supplemental essays about why I wanted to attend Boston College (BC), and why I wanted to become a teacher. BC\u2019s Lynch School of Education and Human Development attracted me because of its education program.\nThis tour was a few weeks before I was selected to present a speech at the back-to-school convocation in front of every K-12 teacher in the district on my passions for education and teaching. Becoming a teacher was a personality trait for me. \u201cMost likely to become part of Lower Moreland Faculty: Riane Lumer.\u201d I even won a scholarship award for someone potentially entering the field of education. \u201cWe\u2019ll be colleagues one day!\u201d my choir director constantly joked my senior year. \u201cYou\u2019ll take over the organization in the future,\u201d my Mini-THON advisor told me.\u00a0\n\t\tI had wanted to be an English teacher since I was in fifth grade \u2014 or so I thought.\nMy sophomore year at BC, I student-taught at Brighton High School, a turnaround Boston public school in Massachusetts. This was something I was itching to do throughout my first year. I just wanted to get in the classroom.\u00a0\n\t\t\n\t\nLike most city schools, students in the urban district are victims of pervasive systemic disparities that contribute to educational debt. I recognized this upon the first day of my pre-practicum and felt a need to assist on a political level. My passion for reform only intensified after more time connecting with students.\u00a0\nBut this desire extends beyond the role of a teacher. \u201cThere\u2019s only so much a teacher can do within the classroom for change,\u201d I thought to myself.\u00a0\n\tAnd so, after a month of teaching, I began to heavily question a future in it. That frightened me\u00a0\u2014 leading me to suppress these feelings until the end of the semester, when I truly began to consider that this really wasn\u2019t the path for me. I didn\u2019t want to swallow that pill. I didn\u2019t think I knew myself without it.\nI was grieving a dream that died, a future for myself that no longer matched what I had imagined for years. New experiences and exposures changed me and sparked bigger aspirations. But I also felt as though I failed myself; my family always told me teaching wasn\u2019t for me, and I thought I was rebelling. Well, they were right, but for different reasons.\u00a0\nI added a third major: political science. But I was faced with another dilemma. The licensure teaching program at BC was the last thing keeping me there. And the summer prior to that, the excitement for student-teaching and jump-starting my career in education counteracted my detached emotions toward the atmosphere of BC.\u00a0\nI applied to transfer to NYU during the spring semester of my sophomore year. I enrolled in their education school, but I didn\u2019t attend. I wanted to give BC one more shot: it was my top choice, and I wanted it to feel the way I expected. And I wanted my zeal for teaching to return, because that was all I thought I knew and was attached to. That linear path was comforting to me. It was something that I felt was within my grasp and control.\nOn May 18, 2022, I received my acceptance to Penn as a junior transfer majoring in political science. Yes, a junior transfer who also was entering with a new major that they had only taken one course for at their prior institution.\u00a0\nEmbracing my desire to transfer and reshape my career trajectory ignited my newfound eagerness to continuously explore new avenues that ignite my joy and curiosity. When I got onto Penn\u2019s campus, I applied to join The Daily Pennsylvanian\u2019s opinion and podcast departments and became a writer for 34th Street Magazine. At BC, I was involved primarily in educationally-oriented activities. It was my whole world; anything like writing for the student newspaper felt irrelevant to my future career. I was wrong and naive. And I ended up writing about it.\u00a0\nBecause of my experiences at the DP and with my journalistic writing minor, I explored the world of journalism \u2014 a discipline one of my English professors at BC suggested would be a good fit for me. But I refused to depart from what I thought was my path, until my college experience took an unexpected turn on its head.\u00a0\nCurrently, I\u2019m unsure exactly what the future holds for me, but I am learning to find peace in all of the possibilities. When I transferred, I abandoned the habit of attempting to assume control over every aspect of my life and plan each detail. Instead, I embrace the uncertainty of the future and approach my twenties as a blank canvas, ready to be painted with new experiences and opportunities.\u00a0\nMy college experience has been anything but conventional. Although I will be walking across the stage this month, I will not be officially graduating until December \u2014 another detour from what I expected when transferring to Penn and assuming I would \u201cgraduate on time.\u201d\nWhen I met with my advisor and he broke the news to me that I would not be graduating \u201con time,\u201d I panicked and my stomach dropped. Instinctively, I felt that I was falling behind. But in the aftermath of that moment, I began to question the concept of \u201con time.\u201d What does it truly mean? Especially for me? I realized that this phrase carries little significance \u2014 it's more about when things unfold as they're meant to. The right time is when it happens, and this fall, I will be embarking on another chapter by participating in the Penn in Washington program in D.C. (another transfer application bucket list item!).\u00a0\nThe social clock, a sociological theory identified by Bernice Neugarten, is a timetable of expectations for reaching milestones in your life predicated on external pressures and cultural norms embedded into societal structures. But as I have come to view it, the pressures of the social clock can seep into every level of decision-making in your life, if you allow it to sway you in determining how to act according to what you believe society would expect of you, or adhering to what others are doing around you.\u00a0\nI fell victim to this when experiencing dilemmas about my future. Now, I check myself as I fall into its harmful cycles time and time again. During rush, girls consistently asked me what post-grad job I had lined up or where I would be living. I didn\u2019t know, but I was no longer embarrassed. Everyone has their own timelines, and we are all working to figure them out. The rigorous, hyper-competitive nature of Penn especially subscribes to the demands of the social clock, so beware.\u00a0\nI find that the best way to withdraw yourself from this phenomenon is to know yourself. To listen to yourself. I encourage you to ask yourself, who are you? What sparks your curiosity? What excites you? What makes you tick? Are you driven by passions you have developed, or are you driven to fit the mold of what you think society expects of you?\u00a0\nAs I write this on my last day of classes at Penn, I sit at my desk reflecting on the past two years of my journey while a mug gifted from Penn\u2019s Transfer Student Organization to seniors sits next to my computer reading, \u201cI survived transferring.\u201d\u00a0\n\t\tGet our newsletter, DP Daybreak, delivered to your inbox every weekday morning.Yes, I did. But more importantly, I've transformed into a person I never envisioned \u2014\u00a0I was so overly fixated on preserving what felt safe and comfortable that I lost sight of who I was actually evolving into. \u00a0\nI leave with a reminder to my future self and to all of you: It's okay to outgrow places, people, things, habits, visions, or worldviews. Don't feel guilty about change and growth \u2014 untether yourself as you enter into new phases.

          "article_content": "Of the dozens of campus tours I\u2019ve given for the Kite and Key Society, each one has been different. I\u2019d switch out old stories for new ones or change how I\u2019d present information to prospective students and their families. The start of my tours, however, always remained the same:\n\"Penn was founded in 1740 by Benjamin Franklin. He was a founding father of the United States, printer, inventor, and so much more. Franklin didn\u2019t like to be defined by just one thing, and that\u2019s the spirit we love to embody through interdisciplinary experiences here at Penn.\"\n\t\tI said these lines almost every week for my three years as a tour guide, yet I never thought of internalizing them myself. Even though I had varying interests both inside and outside of the classroom, I defined my identity as the girl who worked for The Daily Pennsylvanian for the majority of my time as a Penn student.\nThe DP was the first organization that I joined at Penn. As a lonely first-year student going stir-crazy in my bedroom due to the COVID-19 pandemic, I elected to join a club during my spring semester to give myself something to do outside of my schoolwork. After aimlessly scrolling through the Penn Clubs website, I stumbled upon the DP\u2019s page. My high school didn\u2019t have a newspaper, so I was weary of writing. But I\u2019ve always loved grammar. Thus, my love of copy editing was born.\n\t\t\t\tSEE MORE FROM ALLYSON NELSON:\ufeffPenn softball swept by Harvard'A perfect fit': Penn softball's Megan Huang is off to a strong startEverything after that point was a blur. I entered the DP\u2019s Pink Palace for the first time when COVID-19 restrictions were lifted, learned the intricacies of fact-checking and style editing, and realized that I was part of something much bigger than myself. I sought leadership as soon as I was able, and before I knew it, my entire world revolved around the DP.\nI prioritized the DP above all else. I\u2019d push off assignments to edit articles, tune out in class to look over a breaking story and cancel plans with friends to take on extra DP work. Even as a deputy copy editor, the DP was a full-time job. And when I finally became one of the two head copy editors on the 139th Board, I felt like I was always working overtime. If I wasn\u2019t actively editing, I was thinking about the DP. I kept my phone on me at all times, anxious that a breaking story would suddenly come through and I\u2019d need to edit at a moment\u2019s notice.\n\tIt slowly dawned on me after my first semester as copy editor that this life was no longer sustainable. The DP was negatively impacting my academic life, personal relationships, and mental health, and there was only so much more I could handle. Coinciding with the fact that I had just been elected summer executive editor \u2014 meaning I hadn\u2019t taken any extended time off from the DP in two years \u2014 I knew that I needed change. So what did I do? I accepted leadership positions in other clubs alongside my work at the DP.\nTo the naked eye, this decision seemed insane. But what I realized in my first semester as copy editor is that I didn\u2019t know how to tell the DP no. I took on work that I didn\u2019t have to simply because I didn\u2019t have a reason not to. With new responsibilities elsewhere on campus, particularly with Kite and Key and Social Planning and Events Committee Connaissance, I learned that it was okay to take time away from the DP to pursue other opportunities that excited me. These leadership roles taught me how to manage over 100 people, plan large-scale events, and work with major Penn offices, which is something I did not have the ability to do at the DP.\nThis was one of the best decisions I\u2019ve ever made at Penn. Finding other communities on campus made me realize how much I loved the DP. That\u2019s not to say that my other communities were lesser than \u2014 they certainly weren\u2019t \u2014 but taking a step back from the DP allowed me to appreciate the work that I was beginning to resent. I didn\u2019t always groan when a new article to edit was sent to me, nor would I dread having to go into the office. For the first time in a while, I was excited about the DP.\nThis new perspective allowed me to grow even closer with my DP community. My love had never waivered for them before, but my changed outlook made me appreciate their support so much more. It takes a village to keep the DP going, and I am so grateful that I got to work alongside some of the most passionate and motivated people at Penn.\nJulia was the best co-copy editor I could ask for, and our work would not have been possible without the dedication of our wonderful copy deputies \u2014 Charlotte, Diamy, Eleanor, Laura, Maddie, and Riley \u2014 and our equally amazing copy associates. Emi, Imran, and Walden were such strong leaders throughout my time on board, and they believed in me when I could not believe in myself. I am also thankful for Alexis and Caleb, the 139 sports editors, who welcomed me with open arms when I wanted to give sports writing a try as a junior.\n\t\tGet our newsletter, DP Daybreak, delivered to your inbox every weekday morning.My time at the DP would not have been possible without the people who came before me. I am grateful for my copy editor predecessors, Brittany and Sophie, and am also thankful for Delaney, Jonah, and Tyler, who started as my mentors but ended up becoming my closest friends.\nI always ended my tours by saying that if I had to go through the college application process 100 times over, I\u2019d still choose Penn every time. The same goes for the DP. My time in the Pink Palace taught me to be detail-oriented, how to work under pressure, compromise with people who you may not agree with, and \u2014 most importantly \u2014 the difference between an em-dash and an en-dash. Despite the bumps in the road, I\u2019m so glad that the DP was the headline of my Penn experience \u2014 even if it took me time to appreciate it fully.\nALLYSON NELSON is a College senior studying English and American history from Philadelphia.

          "title": "Tulia Falleti | The aftermath I had feared is here",
          "article_content": "Guest columnist Tulia Falleti writes to resign from the position of Chair of the Faculty Senate.Early on the morning of May 10, in less than one hour, the Philadelphia police removed the Gaza Solidarity Encampment protesters from the College Green of our campus. Penn students, staff, and faculty, with their hands zip-tied behind their backs, were separated one by one from those embracing them as they sat on the ground or locked arms around the iconic Ben Franklin statue. Not a punch or a rock was thrown; no one so much as spat.\u00a0\nSince April 25, as Chair of the Faculty Senate, I have observed the encampment, walking by its perimeter several times a day. It was a peaceful protest. I wrote so in a guest column published in The Daily Pennsylvanian on May 4, and I stand by my assessment. On May 6, during one of my visits to the perimeter of the encampment, I noticed a person standing behind the white board that announced the events for the day. I entered the encampment a few feet to read the back of the white board. Listed there were 14 \u201cCommunity Guidelines and Principles.\u201d Number 10 read: \u201cDo not engage with counter-protesters or bad-faith agitators.\u201d\u00a0\n\t\tDuring the two weeks of the encampment, despite events of individualized harassment and intimidation against protesters that were reported to the Penn police and to the Committee on Open Expression, protesters remained non-violent. The speed with which the police were able to dismantle the protest is itself evidence of the protesters\u2019 refusal to resort to violence. Members of our community who characterize chants, signs, flags, even graffiti (which our student protesters covered and asked to be removed) or paint on our beloved founder Ben Franklin\u2019s statue as forms of violence need to turn on their TVs and tune in to violent protests or war scenes from around the world. We can certainly talk about symbolic violence or of hurtful forms of expression, but no one in our campus can say that the encampment that was on College Green from April 25 until this morning \u2014 and that included not only Penn members but also members of the larger Philadelphia community \u2014 has caused any physical harm or physical violence.\u00a0\nThe encampment grew on the evening of May 8, which was of great concern to me. In a worldwide, student-led social movement, in which the encampment \u2014 i.e. peaceful protest with tents \u2014 is a strategy for protest or part of its main repertoire, its modus operandi, and is the only bargaining power that protesters have, the growth of the encampment\u2019s footprint could only indicate one reality: negotiations with the University administration were not progressing. Was the University negotiating in good faith and with respect for the student protesters as our former President Sheldon Hackney had done when negotiating divestment from South Africa in the early 1980s? I could not tell. Did the encampment occupy part of our University\u2019s lawns? Yes, a tiny fraction of those campus properties on which the institution does not pay property taxes and which expand over a significant part of West Philadelphia. Was it disruptive to our educational mission? No, it was not. The building closest to the encampment, College Hall, is under construction, and as of May 1, there are no more classes on campus. Van Pelt Library is across from the encampment, but even when the chants were at some of their highest volume, our students were studying undisturbed in the library. Students also took graduation photos around the encampment, both in front of College Hall and at the Button and the LOVE statue. It was only on the evenings of May 8 (when negotiations had stopped) and May 9 and this morning that university operations were interrupted as the University prepared to clear the encampment. Had the University taken a different approach, our educational activities and access to buildings would have continued uninterrupted.\u00a0\n\t\t\n\t\nI was ending my first year of high school when the last military dictatorship came to an end in my native Argentina. The following year, with my fellow high-school students, we were able to do what the generation before ours could not: We could go into the streets and protest, and we could also occupy our buildings in protest. The generation before mine had been arrested, killed, and disappeared for protesting \u2014 even when the cause was free public transit rides for students. Thanks to our newly regained democracy, my classmates and I could join almost weekly protests in support of democracy, of human rights, of justice, or workers\u2019 rights. And our sit-ins and building occupations always ended with good faith negotiations, never by force. Those were formative political experiences that shaped my future civic and political life and oriented me toward becoming a social scientist and an educator.\u00a0\nToday, I am heartbroken that my university, the institution where I have taught, carried out my research, and worked in service of our students, staff, and faculty in myriad ways for over twenty years, has decided to send in the police to arrest its own students, staff, and faculty. I have been asked if I would hold the same position if the protesters were part of a worldwide encampment movement that was pro-abortion or against immigration. My answer is unequivocally \u201cYes!\u201d I would defend and uphold their right to peacefully protest, because this is a fundamental bedrock right of democracy. The fact that this protest \u2014 like the Occupy Wall Street or the rent protest movements before \u2014 used tents should have led our university community to talk about our land, how we occupy it, how it is taxed (or not) by our city, how it serves our mission, and how we use it. At this precise moment, in fact, the construction work that is going on around College Hall has occupied a larger footprint of our College Green area than the encampment did. Moreover, unlike other universities that use their main green area for graduation, we hold our convocations and graduations in our football stadium, so there was no reason to rush to remove the encampment as the semester came to an end and graduation was due to take place in ten days and over two blocks from College Green. The fact that there were Penn students, staff, and faculty complaining about speech content should have led to discussions about free speech, not censorship. And the fact that order is \u201crestored\u201d by sacrificing rights to free speech and to non-violent protest is exactly what autocracies around the world do now and what dictatorships have done throughout history to repress civic movements and suppress rights. Moreover, the decision itself is shortsighted. The encampment can be removed today, but the worldwide student-led movement will not end.\u00a0\n\tAccording to our rules, as Chair of the Faculty Senate I was not elected but appointed instead by a small Nominating Committee of nine peers. This undemocratic process notwithstanding, I am confident that by upholding our rules and procedures, I could have continued to strive to represent the vast majority of the members of the standing faculty at Penn. For instance, our Senate Executive Committee agreed yesterday to encourage \u201cboth\u00a0the\u00a0administration\u00a0and\u00a0the negotiating team of the student-led movement\u00a0to\u00a0keep\u00a0negotiating\u00a0in\u00a0good\u00a0faith, to de-escalate, and to seek a peaceful resolution.\u201d I would have been thrilled to carry that message if there was anyone to hear it today. I am, however, no longer confident of my ability to work collaboratively with our administration that has sent in the police to arrest its own students, staff, and faculty for participating in a non-violent protest. Thus, I am hereby presenting my resignation as Chair of the Faculty Senate of the University of Pennsylvania.\u00a0\nAs a member of the standing faculty, I will continue to defend academic freedom, free speech, and due process at our university. After serving as Chair-elect and then Chair of the Faculty Senate during the last two years, I am more aware and cognizant than ever of our Faculty Handbook, our Statutes of the Trustees (in particular, Article 11), our essential Guidelines on Open Expression, our carefully structured disciplinary processes for students, our need for academic freedom, and the importance of our shared governance. I am also keenly aware of the challenges that our University has faced in the last year and that are of public knowledge. As two colleagues have recently argued, our University\u2019s rules have been written in times of calm to be applied in times of upheaval. As a faculty member, I will make every effort to ensure that our rules and procedures are followed without bias and without manipulation. That our students, staff, and faculty are treated fairly. If universities such as Penn become one-sided, partisan, and biased, if they give in to external pressures for either political or financial reasons, then there is no hope for higher education in this country or the world. The larger threat is to democracy itself, because such manipulation of our rules, policies, and procedures can only take place in non-democratic institutions.\u00a0\nI leave my leadership role in the Faculty Senate with the following unsolicited words of advice to our administration, our Trustees, our boards\u2019 advisors, and to my fellow colleagues. It comes from our students: \u201cWe commit to assuming the best intentions, granting ourselves and others grace when mistakes are made and approaching conflict with the goal of addressing, repairing, and restoring.\u201d (Guideline number eight of the Penn encampment disbanded today.) May I have the wisdom of our students and future leaders to live up to this principle in the weeks and months to come, given the mistakes committed at Penn today.\u00a0\nTULIA FALLETI is a professor of political science and the former chair of the Faculty Senate.

          "title": "George Honig | It was a mistake to send in the police to end the encampment",
          "article_content": "As an alumnus of Penn, I received communication from the University a few days ago regarding the removal by Penn Police in riot gear (with the assistance of the Philadelphia Police Department) of the encampment of students protesting Israel's violations of the human rights of Palestinians in Gaza. The University's actions have not been fair or even-handed to these students, and I believe the administration is on the wrong side of history. \u00a0\nIn my view, the students\u2019 demands have been reasonable and just, as this war shows no signs of ending. On Oct. 7, a Hamas raid (which I have condemned) killed 1,100 Israelis. Today, Israel's eight-month military operations have killed 40,000 people, displaced nearly 2 million, and destroyed more than 50% of the buildings in Gaza. What Israel has done is not justice or defense, but rather barbarism and immorality by the standards of the Jewish, Christian, or Muslim religions, or by any reasonable standard of international law. It is for this reason that the International Court of Justice has allowed a case for genocide to proceed against Israel. \u00a0\n\t\tI was especially appalled that dozens of Penn faculty members traveled to Israel in January and met with Israeli President Isaac Herzog, who is specifically mentioned in the International Court of Justice finding. This is equivalent to a faculty member meeting with Vladimir Putin or Slobodan Milo\u0161evi\u0107. I cannot believe that any Arab, Palestinian, or Muslim student could think that they would be treated fairly by these faculty.\nTo say that Penn has been even-handed in its dealings with pro-Israeli and pro-Palestinian students is demonstrably false. Shortly after Oct. 7, Penn convened an antisemitism task force, which was done in partnership with the American Jewish Committee, and we have received continuous communication about this committee. I call on Penn to immediately establish a task force to specifically address Islamophobia and anti-Arab and anti-Palestinian racism on campus, and that this task force work in cooperation with the Council on American-Islamic Relations and the American-Arab Anti-Discrimination Committee. \u00a0\n\t\t\n\t\nI also call on Penn to evaluate investments in any activity which may violate human rights or international law. Such an approach needs to be applied to Israel in light of events in Gaza, but should also be applied to any other countries committing war crimes or human rights violations.\nThe demands of the students protesting on College Green were just by any reasonable standards. The University refused offers of mediation by several members of the Philadelphia City Council. Penn's actions do not enhance public safety and will produce a chilling effect on free speech in the future. I call on Penn to drop any charges against the students involved in the encampment, and apologize to the community for excessive use of force.\n\tI am currently a Platinum-level alumni donor to Penn. I am currently serving on the alumni admissions committee, and I am active in the Penn and Wharton clubs of Chicago. I will continue to support the University, but I want to reiterate how very disappointed I am in Penn's response to this crisis.\nGEORGE HONIG is a 1987 Wharton graduate.

First, we would like to thank Interim Penn President Larry Jameson and the administration, Penn Police, Philadelphia Mayor Cherelle Parker, and the Philadelphia Police Department for the effective, efficient, and professional clearing of the encampment to return our campus to a safe place for all students and faculty.\u00a0\nNobody wants our students to be harmed, and we do not wish to penalize anyone who is practicing their right to free expression. However, we are hopeful that the University will engage in a thorough and fair disciplinary process to ensure that students and faculty who are not adhering to the code of conduct face appropriate consequences for inciting hate and creating a threatening campus environment. This should apply to anyone fomenting hate and encouraging destruction of property. We recognize that many of these people are not students on this campus. We condemn any further escalation, especially by non-Penn agitators, and look forward to a safe and meaningful conclusion to the academic term, including long-awaited graduations, commencement, and class reunions.\u00a0\n\t\tWe welcome civil and respectful discussion. We advocate for the release of the hostages and elimination of Hamas and other organizations funded by terrorism as a critical goal to achieve in reaching an end to this war. We cannot move on as a community until we can come together as a community. The entire country is heartbroken that it has come to this with many of the college encampments, but the only way forward is to choose dialogue and understanding over hate.

Some of my students use historical methods to answer their research questions. Occasionally, a student asking a historical question will explore The Daily Pennsylvanian's archives. My students have experienced surprise, delight, and sometimes shock when combing through old DP articles and learning about local, national, and international issues important to previous generations of Penn students.\nOver the past two weeks, I, like many other Penn faculty members, have deeply appreciated the professionalism and commitment of our student journalists. DP journalists have reported tirelessly about the encampment on our College Green.\n\t\tI was stunned, therefore, when I got to campus around 7:30 a.m. today, to see that police were not allowing DP reporters inside the barricade to report on the encampment removal. I asked two DP reporters and one DP photographer, who were being blocked by a line of police officers with batons, why they weren\u2019t being allowed in. \u201cThey don\u2019t take us seriously,\u201d one reporter replied. Meanwhile, I saw a reporter for a network news channel allowed to head up Locust Walk to College Green.\nA Philadelphia Inquirer article reported later today that another DP journalist, who arrived at College Green at 5 a.m. before the dismantling of the encampment began, was \u201cgrabbed by two Penn police officers and moved back from the statue. \u2018I kept saying I was a student and a member of the press,\u2019 the reporter said. \u2018I kept on asking why I wasn\u2019t allowed to be there, and I would get no responses.\u2019\u201d\n\t\t\n\t\nWhile I assume that at some point, the police must have allowed some members of the DP inside the barricade, I just want DP student journalists to know that I take you seriously.

          "article_content": "Professors Ann Farnsworth-Alvear and Zita Cristina Nunes urge us to read Penn\u2019s Guidelines on Open Expression, arguing that it would be a perversion of those guidelines for the University to discipline students organizing the encampment on College Green, or to take any measures to end the encampment other than negotiation with the protesters. I have taken their advice and read those Guidelines and find nothing that mandates negotiation as the only appropriate response by the University.\nFarnsworth-Alvear and Nunes cite the part of the Guidelines that states that \u201cIn case of conflict between the principles of the Guidelines on Open Expression and other University policies, the principles of the Guidelines shall take precedence,\u201d (Guidelines I.D), but they interpret this as if it meant that no University policy may be enforced if it restricts open expression by students. This is a misreading of that clause since that document itself makes reference to disciplinary procedures (Guidelines V.D) and mandates the University establish policies and procedures for securing permission to hold demonstrations on campus (Guidelines III.A.2.b). As I read Interim Penn President Larry Jameson\u2019s letter to the Penn community on May 6, the University has determined that the current encampment on College Green is in violation of those policies and procedures (among others), and has instructed the encampment to disperse (in line with Guidelines III.B and V.C). Since the protesters have not complied with this instruction (thus falling under Guidelines III.B), the disciplinary procedures invoked in Guidelines V.D come into play. The Guidelines also discuss the possibility of \u201c[t]erminating a meeting, event, or demonstration by force,\u201d (Guidelines V.C.4), about which it urges extreme caution, citing the possibility of exacerbating existing tensions, and the concern to avoid \u201cinjury to persons\u201d and \u201cproperty damage.\u201d\n\t\tMy point is that the University\u2019s current response to the encampment, which involves initiating the student disciplinary process against organizers yesterday, and using police to shut down the encampment this morning, is in line with its own Guidelines for Open Expression.\nSUSAN SAUV\u00c9 MEYER is a retired professor of philosophy.

          "article_content": "More than one week into the encampment on College Green, with over 150 incidents of antisemitism and harassment reported to Penn Hillel, the public endorsement of two United States-designated terrorist organizations, and two American flags planted near the encampment being forcibly removed and damaged by protesters, students have had enough. It is time to end this antisemitic and anti-American encampment now.\u00a0\nOn April 26, pro-Israeli and Jewish students sponsored a screening of the Oct. 7 massacre adjacent to the Button on campus, broadcasting the screen in the direction of the encampment. Standing just outside the encampment when the video was playing, I heard three protesters clapping and cheering as a video of an Israeli woman getting raped and paraded in the streets of Gaza was displayed. The night before, I spotted a protester wearing a sweater with a Star of David and two rats depicted on the back, which imitates Nazi-style propaganda from the 1930s.\u00a0\n\t\tThe following night, protesters were recorded cheering \u201cAl Qassem make us proud, take another soldier down.\u201d Al Qassem is the military wing of Hamas, the group behind the Oct. 7 rape, mass murder, and abduction of Israeli civilians that has contributed to the deaths of thousands of Israelis and Palestinians since it took control of Gaza in 2007.\u00a0\nLast Tuesday, I walked near the encampment and saw a large PFLP (Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine) flag flying, which is a U.S.-designated terror organization. PFLP has been behind numerous terror attacks against Israeli civilians, including the hijacking in 1976 that diverted a flight leaving Israel to Entebbe, Uganda, and the raid of a Jerusalem synagogue, killing four in 2014. PFLP also opposes all negotiations with Israel and only envisions a Middle East without a Jewish state.\n\t\t\t\tEven worse, Penn\u2019s anonymous social media app, Sidechat, has been filled with an increasing number of pro-Palestinian supporters at Penn speaking out against the encampment, citing the diversion of the encampment from the values of the protest. Instead of protesting for the establishment of a Palestinian state and the end of the war, the encampment has turned this movement into an antisemitic cesspool, where students cannot walk on campus with Judaica items without being harassed by protesters. Even worse, not all members are students. When I attempted to look inside the encampment several days ago, I was approached by two protesters acting as \u201cguards.\u201d They did not name themselves, but they both acknowledged that they were not students, just Philadelphia residents with no association to Penn. Why should people outside of the Penn community have the ability to use Penn property to sleep and harass Jewish students? Why are non-Penn affiliates determining who is and who is not allowed on parts of our campus?\nOn April 29, pro-Palestinian protesters stormed Hamilton Hall at Columbia University, shattering the front windows and taking one security guard hostage. NYPD then forcefully removed the protesters, facing instant backlash. With Columbia's administration being hesitant to clear up the protest, students were able to easily obtain access to the building and vandalize it. As the protests at Penn are continuing to radicalize, the administration must follow through on their promise to clear the encampment before it is too late. Penn could be next.\u00a0\n\tSupporting the encampment and the groups they endorse is preventing any meaningful action and dialogue from occurring at Penn. Instead of speaking to diverse groups of students about their experiences with the conflict, the encampment is choosing to invite individuals outside of the Penn community to come to Penn and harass Jewish students. Instead of inviting leaders of the Jewish community to speak with students on the other side to discuss issues and common ground, the Chabad rabbi is being denied entry into the encampment because he is visibly Jewish. Instead of making Jewish students willing to talk to pro-Palestinian protesters about points of common ground, Jewish students are being harassed with Nazi-era rhetoric and praising of terrorist organizations that want to annihilate Jews from this planet.\nIf we want real action and dialogue to occur on this campus, continuing to support an encampment that has turned into an antisemitic hatefest continuing to harass Jewish students is not the answer. There is room for dialogue, there is room for peaceful protest, and there is room for change. There is a difference between a peaceful protest to endorse a cause, and cheering for terrorist groups that actively call for the elimination of Jewish students. Harassing Jewish students is not the best method to get community members to support your cause. Enough is enough.\nBEN MESSAFI is a College first year studying economics and political science from Westchester, N.Y.

          "title": "Zack Ben-Ezra | The free speech double standard",
          "article_content": "In the past week, much has been written about the Gaza Solidarity Encampment that sprung up on Penn\u2019s campus. Much has missed the point.\u00a0\nLet me be clear and unequivocal before I proceed: I strongly believe in protecting free speech, especially speech I disagree with, but that protection must be applied even handedly and is not without sensible content-neutral limitations.\u00a0\n\t\tFree speech and academic freedom are paramount to a productive university campus. A university should be a place where ideas are freely exchanged, where we encounter new ideas that make us uncomfortable, and where we ultimately grow as a community in the pursuit of some greater truth. Not everyone needs to agree, nor should they, but we must remain respectful and even-handed to ensure that ideas continue to flow, and the marketplace of ideas continues to flourish.\u00a0\nThe Penn community and its leadership has utterly failed to even handedly protect free speech on campus.\u00a0\n\t\t\n\t\nNo one has the right to set up an encampment in violation of university policy \u2014 it doesn\u2019t matter what you are protesting or on which side you are. That is a simple viewpoint-neutral time, place, and manner restriction \u2014 a \u00a0fundamental principle of our free speech jurisprudence.\u00a0\nIn his Apr. 26 university-wide email, Interim Penn President Larry Jameson himself acknowledged that the \u201cencampment itself violates the University\u2019s facilities policies\u201d and that \u201charassing and intimidating comments and actions by some of the protesters, which were reported and documented by many in our community, violate Penn\u2019s open expression guidelines and state and federal law, including Title VI of the Civil Rights Act.\u201d Jameson then ordered the encampment to disband.\n\tThat was more than a week ago, and the encampment remains active on College Green.\nIt truly perplexes me how an Ivy League institution actively being sued under Title VI can simultaneously admit that there are Title VI violations on their campus and then take no action to stop them. This is a true failure by university administration, and they deserve to be held accountable.\u00a0\nImagine a situation in which a pro-police encampment sprouted up on campus in the wake of George Floyd and the Black Lives Matter movement. Imagine that the encampment was the same size as the Gaza Solidarity Encampment and was similarly disruptive to campus life and destructive of campus property. Now ask yourself, would that pro-police encampment be tolerated to the same extent that the current encampment is? I have a hard time believing it and so should you.\u00a0\nDon\u2019t believe me? Look no further than the University\u2019s treatment of its own faculty. Professor Amy Wax is currently being investigated and threatened with sanctions for comments she made about racial and ethnic minorities. Let me be clear: I am not here to defend Wax. Her comments deserve to be investigated, and possibly sanctioned. But ask yourself, is the University\u2019s treatment of Wax being fairly applied to other faculty members? I have witnessed members of Penn faculty call for an intifada as part of on-campus protests and have seen Penn lecturer Dwayne Booth\u2019s cartoons that invoke deeply troubling antisemitic tropes. Where are the university-wide investigations into these faculty members? Where is the discussion on university sanctions against them? They are nowhere to be found.\u00a0\n\t\tGet our newsletter, DP Daybreak, delivered to your inbox every weekday morning.Penn and its leadership must work to genuinely uphold free speech and academic freedom on campus. University policy must be applied fairly and in a viewpoint-neutral manner to all members of the campus community. That means protecting speech when appropriate and restricting speech when in violation of reasonable, viewpoint-neutral policies \u2014 whether we agree or disagree with what is being said.\u00a0\nWe have the privilege of being a part of one of the most prestigious universities in the world. This is a privilege of which many of our grandparents could only dream. This privilege comes with the responsibility to engage in discourse in a fair and even-handed manner. It\u2019s about time we start living up to this privilege, and it\u2019s about time Penn\u2019s leadership and faculty started acting as role models in leading the way.\u00a0\nZACK BEN-EZRA is a second-year J.D. student at Penn Carey Law School.

          "article_content": "Guest columnist Rebecca Stein responds to Tulia Falleti's editorial addressing the billboard trucks on campus.Dear Tulia,\nIt saddens me that you chose the return of the billboards as the focus of your concern related to the encampment on College Green. You state that they are part of an external, political campaign against higher education, but I see them as a comfort that I am not alone here at Penn.\n\t\tSince the encampment has gone up, I spend every lunch break in counterprotest. I have my lunch outside the library where I work, with my Bring Them Home Now T-shirt and an Israeli flag. I am there to show Jewish students that they are not alone and to remind the community that the history of the Jewish people is complex, that words matter, and that shouting slogans does not move us to a peaceful resolution; neither at Penn, nor in the Middle East.\nYou write that the students participating in the encampment are \u201cbrilliant and caring.\u201d But I beg to differ: If they were caring, they would not shout \u201cintifada revolution.\u201d They would ask me about my personal experience during the intifada and about my friend\u2019s father, who spent his last 15 years as a quadriplegic after a suicide attack carried out during the first intifada.\n\t\t\n\t\nThe student that held up a sign reading \u201cZionism is racism\u201d is not brilliant. Judaism is both a faith and a nationhood. But it is not a race. There are plenty of Jews of every race living in Israel. These brilliant students would do better listening more and shouting less.\nAnd finally, you write that \u201cwe are a city of Brotherly Love.\u201d But this too seems off. A mother asked me, \u201cWhy are you standing here all alone? There are a thousand Jewish students on campus. Why are they not standing with you?\u201d I asked her why only the Jewish students are required to stand up for the hostages and for the right of Jews for nationhood. In a city of brotherly love, you should all be out there in support of your Jewish and Israeli students, faculty, and staff members when they feel so alone.\n\tStop by and listen; stop by and talk.\nREBECCA STEIN is the co-executive director of the Center for Excellence in Teaching, Learning and Innovation.

          "title": "Faresi Alfaresi | Stop invoking the \u2018violent, raging, Arab\u2019 stereotype",
          "article_content": "I am an international student from Kuwait \u2014 but many assume that I am American upon first meeting me. I have an American accent, tattoos, piercings, and no particular explicit indication of my identity as an Arab man; I do not wear a necklace in Arabic, and I have never worn Arab cultural attire around campus. So, why is it that I constantly have an opinion thrust upon me regarding campus protests and Israel-Palestine as a whole?\nPlease do not misunderstand me as selfishly complaining or not wanting to engage in political discourse. I bring this to light to convey that even I, as relatively non-Arab presenting as I am, have not been spared the Penn community\u2019s blatant and upsetting racial profiling. I have lost count of how many individuals \u2014 ranging from peers to distant acquaintances to strangers \u2014 that I have met who assumed my position on the Israel-Palestine conflict or that I was even Muslim since the escalation on Oct. 7.\n\t\tOf course, it is arguably normal for an individual to make harmless assumptions based on observations. But the issue arises when these assumptions, as often occurs at Penn, become the basis for stereotypical and hateful rhetoric. I study Hebrew at Penn, and other students have always asked me if I feel \u201cangry\u201d or \u201cupset\u201d in class when a discussion centering around Israel or Zionism arises. And therein lies one of the issues: Arab students such as myself are not asked for their positions nor given the benefit of the doubt. We are immediately thrust into a position of aggressive anger and discontent that we never even communicated nor chose ourselves. The notion of the \u2018angry Arab\u2019 is rooted in imperial and colonialist mindsets, and perhaps more salient is the distortion of Arab students\u2019 words and intentions \u2014 a concept reminiscent of the West\u2019s initial misconstruing of Edward Said\u2019s writings.\u00a0\nI have also found minuscule and dwindling support from the Hebrew department during my studies, with my only alternative to finishing my major requirement \u2014 besides a language class that cannot fit my schedule \u2014 being a class revolving around Israeli culture. I cannot help but think of the Penn community's outrage had I been a white and/or Jewish student not being supported in their Arabic studies and forced to take a class around Palestinian culture. To be crystal clear, I would not condone the aforementioned happening to any Jewish student, nor do I condone the alleged forceful attendance of Jewish students to the Palestine Writes Literature Festival for their class. A university as well endowed and progressive as Penn can and should provide ample support and resources to both communities; it would be a grave injustice otherwise. But whilst Jewish students who express their fears garnered earned and necessary support from the University, and even testified at Congress, here I am explicitly expressing my concerns for the safety of myself and other Arab students in another column due to the shameful lack of support.\u00a0\n\t\t\t\tSEE MORE FROM \ufeffFARESI ALFARESI:Penn must not succumb to post-9/11 hysterics and anti-Arab rhetoricDespite all of these concerns, including the ones voiced in my previous column and the data from the survey I have collected, Penn fails to shed light on the concerns and fears of the Arab community. The Jewish community had the antisemitism task force established as far back as November, and the Arab community received the scraps of a generalized \u201ccommission against hate\u201d; I implore us all, regardless of political views and association, to ask why antisemitism is allowed to have the word \u201ctask force\u201d attached to it while anti-Arab hate and Islamophobia does not get the same explicit word? Is this not a clear inequality on the administration\u2019s end? And it is not a matter of semantics, as the explicitness of the antisemitism task force conveys its \u2014 rightful and valid \u2014 importance whilst the generalized \u201ccommission against hate\u201d fails to even include the word \u201cArab\u201d and/or \u201cMuslim\u201d in it, let alone convey the same sense of urgency and action.\u00a0\nThe lack of equal task force establishment, both in speed of establishment and in title, is not the only thing that further divides the struggling communities at Penn. The absolute disregard that interim President Larry Jameson and the Penn administration had for Ramadan and Eid is appalling and indescribably discriminatory; not acknowledging these major religious holidays for a community that is already underrepresented and discriminated against during these trying times communicates one thing: that Arab and Muslim students do not matter.\n\tThis is only exemplified by the fact that less than a week after Eid, an email was sent out that mentioned Passover and the safety of Jewish students in light of encampments. This does not help support or heal the Jewish nor Arab students but rather continues to widen the chasm that our previous president left behind. Are Arab and Muslim students not equally worthy of safety from potential collateral damage caused by protesting? Are Arab and Muslim holidays not worthy of any mention at all? In fact, just as early as May 1, students suffered a chemical attack while security waited before intervention, and the administration has not acknowledged this matter with the urgency the encampment was addressed with. Comments circulated on The Daily Pennsylvanian\u2019s Instagram coverage mocking the individuals and trivializing the attack by claiming the agent was \u201cfart spray,\u201d and a counter-protestor was caught with two knives and walked off with only a citation.\u00a0\nEven more vitriolic and direct hate-speech that weaponizes the \u2018terrorist\u2019 rhetoric was espoused by alleged Penn community members towards Arab students on May 5; protestors at the encampment were awoken with a mocking of the Muslim call to prayer and were directly called \u201cterrorists,\u201d a blatant Islamophobic and anti-Arab notion that harms community members not involved in the encampment and protests. None of the aforementioned has been addressed by Jameson in his volley of emails, further proving Penn\u2019s lack of support for Muslim and Arab students. Again, I cannot help but think of the Penn community's outrage had this happened to any of the pro-Israel counter-protestors who were also exercising their First Amendment rights.\nI have heard the concerns and fears of my Jewish peers, and I am hurt by the thought that students within the mainstream Jewish community have to feel fearful no matter the reason or tangible validity of it. I have attended different seders over Passover, I have co-hosted dialogues to foster understanding, and I will continue to do so and grow my understanding and empathy. But I have mostly been asked if my friends and I \u2014 as Arab individuals\u00a0\u2014\u00a0fear daily life on campus by Arab professors and by friends abroad, rarely by other groups of individuals. So, as a closing note, I beseech all readers to check in on and comfort your Arab peers \u2014 and when their fears and sorrow transform into anger and action, consider all that they have endured and the absolute lack of support before labeling their anger and emotionality as \u2018irrational, \u2018scary,\u2019 and \u2018violent.\u2019\nFARESI ALFARESI is a College junior studying political science and modern Middle Eastern studies from Kuwait.

          "article_content": "We write as faculty members seeking to sound an alarm. We urge Penn administrators and the Board of Trustees not to use police force against on-campus protesters. Real, good-faith negotiation is the path forward. First, because it is more likely to restore calm on our campus. Second, because our University, rightly, has already committed itself to upholding the principle of free expression.\nWe have had the privilege of working with many colleagues in attempts to strengthen that commitment to open expression. Such attempts go back decades. They should not be abandoned now.\n\t\tIndeed, the University has agreed-upon procedures already in place. We have a long-standing Committee on Open Expression. This committee is advisory to the administration. It is charged with interpreting the University\u2019s Guidelines on Open Expression. We value both the Guidelines and the Committee\u2019s role. Both should be reviewed in times of calm \u2014 and honored in times of upheaval. They represent a foundation for the airing of a full range of content on campus and for finding ways to resolve conflicts when they arise. Now is exactly the kind of moment they were written for.\nIn a moment of real crisis, such as we face now, the Guidelines are indispensable because they focus on principles rather than content. A measure of this crucial significance is conveyed by the following assertion in the very Guidelines: \u201cIn case of a conflict between the principles of the Guidelines on Open Expression and other University policies, the Principles of the Guidelines shall take precedence.\u201d\u00a0This statement, taken seriously, opens the door for ongoing dialogue rather than punitive solutions in cases such as that of this encampment.\n\t\t\n\t\nSome on our campus seek to use the Guidelines to undermine rather than support peaceful demonstrators. We argue against any attempt to manipulate the Guidelines in that way.\nWe urge everyone in our community to read them. These Guidelines were written for you.\n\tThe Guidelines must not be a means by which the University pursues the wholesale denial of rights of open expression for an entire group of peaceful protesters. There are mechanisms in place to address the actions of individuals who violate the guidelines. Any such actions should be investigated, with due process being paramount. We are particularly concerned about decisions to issue letters of referral to the Center for Community Standards and Accountability. \u00a0\u00a0\nWe urge interim President Larry Jameson and Provost John L.

          "title": "Olivia Haynie, Jack Starobin, Evie Klein | Three Jewish students say: stop attacking our professors",
          "article_content": "On March 28, 149 Penn alumni and current students sent a letter calling for the punishment of eight Penn professors to Interim Penn President Larry Jameson. The letter accuses these professors of involvement in \u201cpro-terrorism events,\u201d having \u201cdiscriminated against students \u2026 for being Jewish, Israeli, or Zionist,\u201d \u00a0negligence in their duties as teachers, and hindering \u201cthe right to freedom of thought and expression by Jewish students.\u201d Nowhere in this letter do the authors provide examples that back up these claims. Many of these authors do not even know the professors of whom they speak. We are alarmed that so many alumni would sign onto a statement rooted in rumor, hearsay, and conspiracy.\nUnlike many of the letter's signatories, we are Jewish students who know these professors. We have sat in their classrooms, read their work, and, in some cases, cried on their shoulders. We are writing in defense of our professors who are being slandered and used as political pawns in the ongoing attack on academic freedom and free speech. We stand by all eight professors. We are writing on only three of them at length because these are the three we know best.\n\t\tSince my first day in her class \u201cMedia and Culture in Contemporary Iran\u201d last semester, Shams made me feel welcome and supported. When it came up in conversation that I was Jewish, she was very excited to tell me that we had a full day of the course dedicated to learning about the history of Jews in Iran. Our readings for that class were rich and incredibly powerful. We learned about Jews who escaped Poland and found safe haven in Tehran, Iran, during World War II. In class, we watched videos about the experiences of these Jews as well as the Jews who live in Iran today. To censure Shams and her classes would result in Penn losing the only class at this school that has provided me with the chance to learn about this important Jewish history.\nNot only did Shams not discriminate against me for being Jewish, she encouraged me to share my experiences as a Jew in her class and allowed me to feel empowered citing my Jewish identity. Where the accusations that she impedes Jewish students\u2019 freedom of expression in the classroom came from, I have no idea \u2014 especially since the signatories of the letter did not bother citing this claim. From my time in her classroom \u2014 time virtually none of the signatories had \u2014 I saw no proof of this practice and, in fact, saw proof of the opposite.\n\t\t\n\t\nShams was the only professor to reach out to me personally to see how I was doing after the events of Oct. 7, 2023. On Oct. 10, 2023, she wrote to me that she was thinking of me. She offered to even meet with me in person if I needed someone to talk to and that her prayers were with me and everyone else affected by the violence that had broken out. She recognized my Jewishness and the vulnerable state my community and I were in.\u00a0\nIn several of the pieces of \u201cevidence\u201d of Shams\u2019 Jew-hatred that the signatories provide, they engage in logical fallacies. For example, the letter criticizes Shams\u2019 tweet supporting a walkout for Palestine in October 2023. The signatories point out that protesters were ripping down posters, as if this is a relevant point, when nowhere in the tweet does Shams encourage, defend, or even mention posters being ripped down. There is also no evidence she was involved or even aware this behavior was taking place. They accuse her of saying \u201c\u2018Israelites\u2019 deserved the attack they received on October 7\u201d without providing any evidence of this taking place.\n\tShams is one of the most compassionate and empathetic professors I have ever had while at Penn. Shame on anyone who says she does not care about Jewish students, and shame on anyone who dares to accuse her of supporting terrorism. Even more shame on those who would do so with no evidence. To slander a person knowing you have no reasons for your vitriol means that the only place the lies come from is one of hatred. This is not about supporting Jewish students: It is about silencing faculty who are pro-Palestinian, even if it is through immoral means. Now more than ever Penn cannot afford to lose brilliant minds like Shams and voices dedicated to justice and peace. Now more than ever, Penn cannot give in to bullies like the signatories of this letter who seek to limit free speech and academic freedom on our campus.\nI am a Jewish Penn student in Norton's \"Language and Politics\" class. When I read the recent alumni letter accusing Norton of antisemitism, I was baffled. The letter alleges that Norton has engaged in \"disrespectful and dismissive treatment of Jewish students and the Jewish community.\" This description could not be further from the truth.\nLet me begin with the most obvious counterexample to the letter's allegation. Norton has supported me in studying Jewish history. One of my assignments for her class required me to select and analyze a word that has \"traveled\" languages. I selected the word \"ghetto,\" in part for its resonance with my Jewish heritage. As we discussed in class, the word \"ghetto\" first appeared in reference to the segregated Jewish quarter of Venice, Italy, in 1516. Jewish immigrants brought the word to the United States. The Nazis also used the word in their orchestration of the Holocaust.\nNorton not only respected my choice to study this word but also helped me deepen my analysis of it. She posed illuminating questions about the evolution of the word's cultural significance in English, and she treated the entire discussion with the seriousness that the word \"ghetto\" deserves. As a Jewish student, I felt neither unusually conspicuous nor overlooked at any point in her class. I felt free to pursue my interests in community with my professor and my classmates.\nIn the middle of the semester, when a Jewish community group with which I'm involved hosted an event on campus, Norton gave nothing but support to me and my peers. She asked me how she could help us secure an event space, and she has continued to take a supportive interest in my Jewish community group's wellbeing.\nMoreover, my class discussions with Norton have been some of the most engaging I've had at Penn. Norton draws on a remarkable breadth of texts and historical contexts to illuminate our readings each week. I am astounded that anyone would suggest, as does the recent alumni letter, that she exhibits a \"reckless disregard for scholarly and professional norms.\" There has not been a classroom on this campus where I have felt safer, freer, or more excited to ask questions than hers.\nThe people who make me feel unsafe on this campus are those who seek to forcibly silence me and my peers for criticizing Israel. In the past year, I have received hate mail from strangers vowing to \"pay my way to Gaza\" \u2014 presumably to send me to my death for decrying Israeli apartheid. Strangers have called me a \"kapo,\" a \"race-traitor,\" and a \"self-hating Jew\" in response to my critical stance towards the Israeli government's perpetration of genocide in Gaza. MAGA members of Congress like Rep. Elise Stefanik (R-N.Y.) have invoked the notion of Jewish safety in service of a far-right political movement that explicitly welcomes neo-Nazi ideologues and attacks free speech on college campuses like Penn's.\nThese are the people who have \"hindered the right to freedom of thought and expression by Jewish students\" at Penn, to excerpt one of the allegations made in the alumni letter. Threats to our safety come from far-right politicians, strangers online, and a University administration that routinely caves to political pressure at the expense of academic freedom. Not Norton. Norton has modeled integrity in her commitment to the human dignity of Palestinian people, and she exemplifies rigor in her comportment in class.\nIf the authors of the alumni letter care about antisemitism, they should target real antisemites. They should stand against genocide and apartheid. They have nothing to condemn in Norton. If, as they say, they want to stand for a university that gives \"equitable due respect\" to all students, they have everything to learn from her example.\nI met Dwayne \u201cMr. Fish\u201d Booth my first year from the suggestion of a Student Health and Counseling therapist to find someone on campus interested in humor. During our first conversation, he took complete interest in my work and goals as a student, an appreciation he shows to all who step into his classroom. My sophomore year, I took both of his classes, \u201cSick and Satired\u201d in the fall and \u201cWARNING! Graphic Content\u201d in the spring. Among his pupils, Mr. Fish is known for his irreverent sense of humor, eccentric lectures, and ability to foster in-class dialogue. Questioning the material is encouraged, and I constantly use this right to tell Mr. Fish he\u2019s wrong without repercussions.\u00a0\nThe rich tradition of Jewish humor also plays a major role in Mr. Fish\u2019s curriculum. Dating as far back as examples in Talmudic midrash, Jewish humor has served as a tool for Jews to question for over a millennium. Mr. Fish teaches about great, 20th-century Jewish comedians like Mort Saul and Lenny Bruce, who used their humor not simply to entertain, but challenge authority. Mr. Fish has always encouraged me to celebrate this tradition, helping me feel spiritual value in carrying on this practice of my ancestors.\u00a0\nThis semester, I\u2019ve had the opportunity to work with Mr. Fish in an independent study focusing on developing my skills as a writer and humorist. Assignments range from hourlong jazz listening sessions to writing exercises encouraging me to eavesdrop around campus. In between reviewing edits and discussing weekly readings, he always takes the time to ask about my personal life with genuine care. If I forget to disclose a detail about my dating history or family drama in person, he\u2019ll eventually find out through an essay.\u00a0\nIn exchange, he keeps me updated on his own state of affairs. During a meeting in February, he told me about a far-right reporter who wrote a hit piece on his cartoons. As I left his office I said, \u201cIf anyone gives you trouble, tell them 100% of one of your classes is Jewish.\u201d That Sunday, Jameson released his statement condemning Mr. Fish\u2019s cartoons as antisemitic.\u00a0\nI want to acknowledge the pain felt by members of my Jewish community from interpretations of Mr. Fish\u2019s cartoons. The provocative nature of political cartooning leaves room for multiple interpretations, even those unintended by the author. However, I am horrified that my professor\u2019s ability to criticize Israeli occupation and violence is being threatened. The most unsafe I\u2019ve ever felt on campus as a Jew came following a slew of death threats against Mr. Fish. We were forced to temporarily stop meeting in person out of safety concerns. My ability to even debate my professor on his work was put in peril by actions allegedly meant to protect me. \u00a0\nTo see the University and alumni who have no insight into his character censor Mr. Fish dictates a worrying trend. There is nothing more Jewish than creating space for debate, and Mr. Fish\u2019s classroom is one of the few places on campus where this right is fully protected.\u00a0\nThe authors appear to have written this letter not out of concern for the safety of Jewish students, but as a way to bully pro-Palestinian voices with whom the signatories disagree. If this letter's signatories really cared about Jewish students, they would not add to the tension and unease that has already taken over this campus. We hope the administration takes our words and experiences into consideration.\n\t\tGet our newsletter, DP Daybreak, delivered to your inbox every weekday morning.OLIVIA HAYNIE is a College senior studying sociology from Durham, N.C.

          "title": "Natalie Minkovsky | Student protests at Penn",
          "article_content": "As a Penn parent, I received an email on Apr. 26 signed by Interim Penn President Larry Jameson, Provost John L. Jackson Jr., and Senior Executive Vice President Craig R. Carnaroli. The email claimed \u201clegal and policy violations'' by the Penn encampment protesters based on vague allegations of \"harassing and intimidating conduct\" and threatened the students who will continue to protest with \"sanctions.\" No specific examples of harassment, threats, or intimidation were offered in the letter, which appears to be an attempt to demonize the students who exercise their right to free speech enshrined in the United States Constitution and express views inconvenient to Penn's administration.\nI am also very disappointed that the letter did not discuss any of the protesters\u2019 demands nor any attempts by the University leadership to engage with the protesters and discuss these demands. Moreover, the administration did not even mention the \u201celephant in the room\u201d \u2014 the ongoing genocide in Gaza, which prompted our children to occupy College Green. The allegations of genocide were well-documented by the South African charge to the International Court of Justice and ruled to be credible by the Court in January of this year. The daily genocidal attacks on the Palestinian people are evident from reports, photography, and videos published on social media.\u00a0\n\t\tThe complicity of the current U.S. administration in supplying bombs and ammunition \u2014 facilitating the mass murder of more than 30,000 Palestinian civilians, the majority of whom are women and children \u2014 is likewise evident. Moreover, our well-educated and critically-thinking children see the close connection between Penn, which named its Center for Diplomacy and Global Engagement after the current U.S. president, and the Biden administration, which sent former Penn President Amy Gutmann to serve as the U.S. ambassador to Germany.\u00a0\nOur students, currently gathered on College Green, are the best and brightest of the University. What they have to offer to humanity is morality and empathy. They are deeply disturbed by the atrocities committed in our name and want straight answers about Penn\u2019s connection to the military-industrial complex profiting from the current carnage. They demand divestment from the regime, which for dozens of years occupied and oppressed the Palestinian people, and now is engaged in their wholesale slaughter. Our students adorned a campus statue of American revolutionary Benjamin Franklin with the Palestinian flag and keffiyeh, symbols of resistance. I believe he would be proud of this nonviolent protest.\n\t\t\n\t\nStudents protesting injustice on college campuses is not a new and unique phenomenon. Moreover, these acts of resistance proved to be successful on many occasions. 50 years ago, anti-Vietnam War protests contributed to stopping the bloody conflict, which claimed the lives of 58,000 Americans and more than 2 million Vietnamese. 40 years ago, the Boycott, Divestment, and Sanctions (BDS) movement made the brutal South African apartheid regime one of the past. More recently, the BDS campaign designed to pressure the Zionist regime \u2014 which, according to the UN Special Rapporteur and several human rights organizations, including the esteemed Amnesty International, created a \u201ccruel system of domination and crime against humanity\u201d \u2014 to grant full rights to Arab Palestinians resulted in divestment and academic boycotts by dozens of American and Canadian universities.\nGiven its place as one of America's premier academic institutions, Penn is expected to hold itself to a higher level of discourse. Instead, it has chosen to bend to external pressure and cast its students as pariahs.\n\tThe scenes of police violence perpetrated on peaceful student protesters at Columbia University, the University of Texas at Austin, and the University of Southern California by intellectually shallow and irresponsible administrators at those institutions made me, a parent, extremely worried. As a concerned Penn parent, I urge the Penn administration to engage in an open and transparent dialogue with the protesters while ensuring the safety and security of everyone involved. What the students are doing is not an isolated incident of disruption \u2014 it is an act of moral conviction and solidarity. It is a part of a national and worldwide movement to achieve peace and justice for the Palestinian people and stop the genocide perpetrated against them by the Israeli war machine armed, funded, and supported by the Biden administration.\nNATALIE MINKOVSKY is a former biomedical researcher at the Perelman School of Medicine.

          "article_content": "I grew up in a neighborhood in Toronto where simply graduating high school was considered an achievement. In my community, attending a local community college was seen as a significant success. Yet, I found myself crossing international borders to attend Penn, one of the most selective institutions globally. To those I grew up with, I was the embodiment of success \u2014 the girl from Rexdale who escaped the pervasive struggles of our neighborhood.\nMy high school experience was marked by frequent police presence, deemed necessary \"just in case.\" Lockdowns were not out of the ordinary; they were part of our routine. I played the role of a second mother to my three younger siblings and often acted as a mediator between my parents. Our household faced numerous challenges: sometimes the cupboards were bare, leading us to subsist on instant meals from discount stores, or we would find ourselves without hot water, necessitating bucket baths heated on the stove. Our financial instability was such that losing our home was a looming threat, despite renting out part of it to make ends meet. Police interventions at home were so frequent that I had the local division\u2019s number saved for quick dialing.\n\t\tArriving at Penn introduced a different kind of challenge: one that was mentally taxing in ways I hadn't anticipated \u2014 and it wasn\u2019t Penn's fault. When I began applying to universities in the U.S., I learned that I would be classified as a first-generation, low-income student. At the time, this label seemed merely descriptive and unimportant. I was only 16 and quite naive about its implications.\nThe academic culture shock hit me during my first biology class at Penn. The professor casually mentioned concepts we \"should have encountered in high school.\" Many of my classmates had taken Advanced Placement Biology while I hadn't even heard of it before. From day one, I felt behind. My school back home could barely afford basic electives, let alone AP courses. This sense of being perpetually behind followed me into my math classes where even the supposedly introductory courses felt like advanced levels. Despite dropping down to MATH 1300, I struggled immensely and earned a C which only fueled my burgeoning imposter syndrome.\n\t\t\n\t\nBack home, survival required a certain level of emotional detachment. Dwelling on family issues risked unwanted CPS interventions. Personal challenges had to be set aside to make ends meet like waking up early to help with food deliveries to keep our utilities running. For 17 years, I never truly relaxed; there was always something demanding my attention. Arriving at Penn was the first time I could pause and reflect on the accumulated stresses of my past. At Penn, I not only knew about mental health resources available but had direct access to them. Back home, I didn't have the luxury of accessing mental health resources due to financial barriers; we simply had to keep going. So, I did \u2014 until I couldn't.\nAnthony Jack, a Harvard professor, studied the unique experiences of students from disadvantaged backgrounds who attend elite schools. I would describe myself as part of the \"doubly disadvantaged,\" a term coined by Jack. It refers to students from disadvantaged backgrounds who attend elite universities after having gone to underfunded, local high schools.\n\tThe sacrifices I made to attend Penn were significant, encompassing more than just financial strain. According to Jennifer Morton, a Penn professor, these sacrifices include \"ethical goods,\" such as values and relationships that are crucial to our moral development and to living a meaningful life. These goods are unique and irreplaceable.\u00a0\nBack home, they call me \"Ivy.\" My parents say I'm starting to sound American. I wrestle with survivor's guilt, aware of opportunities I have that my siblings will likely never access. Before coming back from my medical leave, I ended up having to use the money I saved up for America to buy things around the house for my family. As a result, in my first semester back from leave, I struggled to buy my own groceries. I am lucky that, with just a few emails, Student Intervention Services was able to help me out. I felt guilty coming home to empty cupboards last spring after this experience, however, and didn't know how to deal with it.\nMy experience as an athlete at Penn brought its own set of challenges. Adjusting to different food options, managing costly groceries, and aligning my meals with athletic training were daunting tasks that impacted my ability to perform and maintain the necessary weight. Despite the privileges of attending Penn, such as waived enrollment fees and substantial financial aid, the FGLI struggle encompasses more than just financial issues. I was unaware of how to effectively interact with professors or even recognize the worthiness of their time, unlike my more affluent peers.\nThis narrative isn't about airing grievances but about highlighting the unique challenges faced by FGLI students. Penn has provided substantial financial support, but there is a glaring need for targeted mental health resources. Mental health support is essential for us because we often encounter unique stresses related to academic preparedness, cultural adjustments, and financial worries which can exacerbate feelings of isolation and imposter syndrome. As the University tries to create a more diverse student body and elevate more members of underrepresented communities, the onus is placed on Penn to truly create an environment that allows these students to thrive once they matriculate.\n\t\tGet our newsletter, DP Daybreak, delivered to your inbox every weekday morning.I mentioned a lot of resources at Penn that can help FGLI students, but they\u2019re not advertised. I didn\u2019t know about them until I took my medical leave. It shouldn\u2019t take having to be hospitalized to be aware of these resources. These resources, like SIS, could have helped prevent my hospitalization in the first place. It wasn\u2019t until I told my Penn therapist about my food insecurity that I learned that SIS could help in these matters. It wasn\u2019t until after the hospitalization that I learned about the extent to which my Penn insurance covered expensive mental treatments outside of school that would have supported me without taking a leave.\u00a0\nSucceeding as a FGLI student at Penn \u2014 or any elite institution \u2014 requires more than just financial aid; it demands comprehensive support that addresses both academic and emotional needs.\nOMONYE OSEZUA is a junior studying computational biology from Toronto.

          "title": "Tulia Falleti | The billboard trucks are back",
          "article_content": "Yesterday morning, a billboard truck parked at the corner outside of my office on the University of Pennsylvania\u2019s campus, at Walnut and 36th streets. It played a four-minute video loop of the Hamas terrorist attack of Oct. 7, 2023. These were horrific and painful images and sounds. Charred human bodies, a desperate mother fearing for her baby\u2019s life, two young siblings crying and yelling that their older sister had been taken and was not coming back while their heartbroken parents tried in vain to console their children.\u00a0\nThe billboard trucks \u2014 which had been a fixture of Penn\u2019s campus in the weeks leading to former President Liz Magill\u2019s forced resignation last December \u2014 being back also keeps me awake at night. I fear that it forebodes another traumatic crisis on campus.\u00a0\n\t\tThe billboard trucks at Penn, just like the airplane that flew over the Harvard University and Massachusetts Institute of Technology campuses in early December 2023, are part of a concerted, external political campaign against higher education institutions, against academic freedom, against open expression, and, in the case of our University, against a peaceful protest of students, staff, faculty, and local community members. On our campus, as on so many others around the country and the world, this student-led protest movement has taken a particular form: that of the encampment. The encampment is what characterizes the form of protest of this student movement. This is what social movement scholars call the repertoire of collective action. Unlike past student movements that took over university buildings, this less intrusive and disruptive movement occupies the carefully mowed, green grounds of our universities\u2019 campuses, instead.\u00a0\nOur Penn encampment was created shortly after 4 p.m. on Thursday, April 25. As a concerned faculty member who deeply believes that the right to peaceful protest is a fundamental right of democracy, I have walked around the perimeter of the encampment every day, several times per day. I have witnessed with my own eyes that this is a peaceful protest of Penn students, staff, and faculty.\u00a0\n\t\t\n\t\nThe students participating in this encampment are the brilliant and caring students we admitted to Penn because our admissions officers saw world leaders and problem solvers in their applications. These are students who most likely selected Penn over other universities because we are the civic Ivy: a University that cares about its local community, a University created by Benjamin Franklin on the Quaker value that all of us can and must contribute to the collective good every day. These are the students our University will solicit for future donations, who will be invited to Homecoming events, who make up the blood and soul of Penn \u2014 just as all our students do.\u00a0\nAlso at the encampment are Penn staff members who keep our departments and centers running efficiently, who work in their offices all day even when classes are not in session, who regularly stay late to run our evening academic events, who are responsible for making the wheels of our University turn. At the encampment are also faculty who have worked at Penn from a few years to a few decades. Colleagues who are passionate about their subjects, who are world leaders in their fields of study, who devote their lives to our University, to their scholarship, to teaching and mentoring our graduate and undergraduate students, and who volunteer in the countless committees that are the connective tissue of our University\u2019s shared governance: from facilities to academic curriculum committees and everything in between.\u00a0\n\tThe encampment also includes Drexel University and Temple University students, part of the same student-led social movement, and other members of the local community. I don\u2019t know them as well, but I suspect they are a diverse group of individuals who, like many people around the world, are mobilizing because they believe that a genocide is taking place in Gaza and that there should be a ceasefire. These are members of the community that we encourage our students to partner with in our Academically Based Community Service courses. These are parents, siblings, and children who live next door, people we may have met in our local schools, grocery stores, or restaurants. These are Philadelphians.\u00a0\nTo some, our encampment is a sign of hope, the awakening of a generation to the unsustainable and unjust reality of the Palestinian people in Gaza and the West Bank. To others, such as those funding the billboard trucks, the encampment is a sign of a misguided youth. I have heard Jewish staff and students who prefer not to walk by the encampment. I understand them. The encampment brings to the fore difficult messages, chants, and debates. As an educational community, however, we cannot move forward by silencing or censoring debate and dissent. We must make room (both physically and symbolically) to encourage these conversations with open minds and hearts: Listening, reading, writing, learning, doing what we do every day on our campus to better understand each other and the world we live in. If we silence a large part of our student body, if we censor our staff, if we self-censor as faculty for fear of being misinterpreted, retaliated against, doxxed, or sanctioned, our University is no longer an institution of higher education. Without allowing room for dissent and for genuine dialogue over complex issues, universities die.\u00a0\nWe are the City of Brotherly Love; we are the city of the First Amendment. Today, I am proud to be a professor at Penn and not a professor at Columbia University, at Emory University, or at any of the other universities that have sent riot police to forcefully remove and arrest their students, staff, and faculty from their encampments and lawns. I am also proud of our Philadelphia police, who I saw de-escalating conflict on campus on Thursday afternoon and allowing peaceful protesters to carry on with their fundamental democratic right to peacefully protest. I look up to Northwestern (where I attended graduate school), Brown, Rutgers, Berkeley, Wesleyan, Dickinson, and all the other universities and colleges that allow this peaceful encampment movement to continue or that have negotiated in good faith with students, as possible models for future decisions. Based on our campus experience from last December, I look forward to the billboard trucks not dictating what happens on our campus. But most importantly of all, I look forward to tomorrow being another day of peaceful encampment protest at Penn and to our University administration negotiating in good faith with our students.\u00a0\nTULIA G.

          "title": "Jesse Zhang | Cheers to never having it 'normal'",
          "article_content": "I remember the day I was admitted to Penn like it was yesterday (off the waitlist, I might add). I was home in China due to the COVID-19 pandemic, and it was four days before my high school graduation on Zoom. I breathed a sigh of relief as the sense of certainty settled in: I was finally going to have a normal college experience.But who was I kidding? My friends and I were graduating from living rooms, cars, and socially-distanced football fields. People took to the streets around the world to advocate for racial justice. And the 2020 United States presidential election, one that was as long as it was mentally tormenting, was in full swing. We all yearned for normalcy, but nothing about our lives was normal.While I had to begin my first year at Penn from my bedroom in China, I was determined to not let it diminish my experience. As such, over a Zoom meeting, I joined The Daily Pennsylvanian\u2019s multimedia department. As a staffer, I took photos in corners of my world that had any miniscule resemblance to the writers\u2019 experience in America. My first big assignment came when former photo editor Sukhmani Kaur asked me to stay up all night and edit photos as they rolled in on Election Day. What kind of first year gives up a night of sleep for a little club assignment? Not normal.Though my journey at the DP started with me completing one assignment every two weeks, I would have never foreseen how it would come to define my time at Penn.Being photo editor in 2022 allowed me to further see Penn through my camera lens. I skipped classes and meals to follow former Penn President Liz Magill to all corners of campus during the first 100 days of her tenure. I negotiated with the Secret Service to allow our own photography equipment into a campaign event with President Joe Biden and former President Barack Obama. I drove a group of photographers home at 4 a.m. after Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro and Dr. Mehmet Oz\u2019s respective election night parties. Normal? Hardly.As president in 2023, I would go on to sign my name on the dotted line and initiate the purchase of a permanent home for the DP. Our team weathered a pivotal chapter in Penn\u2019s history which culminated in the resignation of University leaders. In those months, I woke up to dozens of hate emails in my inbox every day, and our reporters worked around the clock to keep up with national news organizations which possessed more manpower and resources.\u00a0One of the copy editors on the 139th board, Allyson Nelson, quipped of the news cycle at Penn as \u201cwhen it rains, it pours.\u201d As fun (and often exhausting) as it was to spend an ungodly amount of time in our infamously windowless office and eat countless Zesto\u2019s pizzas, I also realized how abnormal of a collegiate experience it was. I was missing out on weeknight hangouts with friends, happy hours during restaurant week, formals, parties, and other archetypes of a \u201cnormal\u201d college experience. For the first two and a half of my three in-person years, my friends have considerately learned to not schedule dinners with me on weeknights.Not normal! (Shoutout to my friends for putting up with me).Though as time went on, I grew to love the abnormality. Reporting taught me how to work with tight deadlines and competing priorities. Photographing protests showed me the importance of connecting with different communities. Leading a team through crises challenged my empathy, grit, and social consciousness. The abnormality presented me with a unique skill set and undoubtedly shaped my character. Above all, I loved how it strengthened my optimism and resilience.Or maybe it\u2019s because I loved giving people ridiculous reasons on why I cannot make lunch: \u201cI HAVE TO go to the airport and photograph Air Force One.\u201dI am acutely aware of the fact that my sense of abnormality is not unique. In many ways, the normalcy the Class of 2024 yearned for at the start of our college years never arrived. While we no longer have to wear masks in classrooms or get swabbed twice a week in a giant air-ventilated tent, we are in the midst of another pivotal U.S. presidential election. We are having unprecedented discussions regarding First Amendment rights on college campuses, and our communities are feeling the inevitable ripples of conflicts across the world.Rather than letting these challenges loom over our impending graduation, we should consider the opportunities that they present. We are uniquely positioned to speak out about issues close to our hearts, have constructive conversations on the most contentious topics of the day, and act to improve the community around us.While the COVID-19 pandemic put in-person socializing on hold, we learned how to forge connections and friendships through screens. We saw the importance of becoming more self-educated and practicing our civic duties during the Black Lives Matter movement and the 2020 elections. Not since the civil rights movement and Vietnam anti-war protests of the 1960s has so much media attention been dedicated to college campuses across the country, and we must use what we learned from the abnormality of our college experience to rise up to the challenge.Between our myriads of farewell toasts, I realize that what began as a quest for normalcy evolved into an embrace of abnormality. Our college graduation is hardly the ultimate epilogue; it is merely the cliffhanger to the rest of our lives. The abnormality we saw throughout our time in college will undoubtedly change the ways in which we can and will approach the world. So in all the ways we are celebrating the Class of 2024 this graduation season, here\u2019s cheers to the abnormality that made us one of a kind.JESSE ZHANG is a Wharton senior studying business economics and public policy and marketing from Shenzhen, China.

          "title": "Esther Lim | Dear sports",
          "article_content": "I remember when I first watched your white net snap taut from a goal scored. Seeing the plus one on the scoreboard felt just like that rush I feel when the music is perfect and I row into top gear. I knew I\u2019d return for the next few matches at home. Even when the evening trains would rumble across the bridge behind Rhodes Field, and their terrific chug would drown out announcements of player substitutions that I really needed to hear, I was delighted I was the one to be there \u2014 soles suctioned to metal bleachers, fingers chilled stiff, and eardrums blitzed by bursts of crowd noise \u2014 to witness and write about it all.\nI loved my postgame sprints across the field to the home bench, holding two phones on record just in case one wouldn\u2019t be enough to catch every word of my interviews. I remember how the beginnings felt so unfamiliar, meeting and asking questions to names I'd already scrutinized from stat sheets and rosters. But any nerves sank when I remembered how much fun it was to talk about you.\n\t\tI loved watching all the ways you could move. Heels anchored into grass and how spines would pivot, or squeaks of sneakers on glossy hardwood below century-old Palestra rafters. I loved how it would all happen so fast. A baton pass as fluid as turning a page of a book, or the ferocious swings of rackets and sticks and bats to mash a bulleting ball. I sought the best words to capture you on the page.\nYou showed no fear and I wanted to feel that way, too. So I plunged into your momentum and kept up. I studied score sheets and rosters like homework. I squinted across courts and fields; memorized the numbers on players\u2019 backs until I could predict the timings of coaches\u2019 substitutions. I loved catching you off-guard to hear my favorite response: \u201cThat\u2019s a great question.\u201d And when anyone would begin to explain to me the game I knew I loved, I learned to straighten my shoulders and interrupt.\n\t\t\n\t\nI spent some years matching your pace. In return, you drew some of the best words out of me. Watching my bylines stack was a thrill I\u2019d share constantly with home, and it felt unreal to think how many people would read my work the next day. But you are rapid. Your routines kept rolling, and my writing grew mechanic. Obligations heaped. Your schedules began to weigh like an anchor on my joy, and what I had feared most would happen finally caught up to flatten my spirit: I grew tired.\nBut I wasn\u2019t tired of you. I will always love being obsessed with you. ESPN still overwhelms my notifications, and I\u2019ll hopefully watch you in a London stadium soon. Maybe I grew tired of knowing you so hard. Making my living in this city became an urgent test, and I rationed my time to be able to live. I didn\u2019t want you to feel like work, too.\n\tI wondered what kind of writer you wanted me to be. What it takes to be the first to break news, to understand every sport as much as my favorite, to learn generations of legendary names I didn\u2019t grow up with. I watched those around me do it excellently. I wondered if we all shared the same amount of hours. But reality had crashed into me like a wave, and when I finally learned how to keep my chin above the surface, I found no energy left to write you in my best words anymore.\nI remember on another sunny afternoon at work, while rolling crates of silverware and counting down my hours on the clock, I watched you through a dim, cracked phone screen showing the 2022 World Cup. At every goal scored, I could hear the roar of cheers from the opposite side of the kitchen pass \u2014 occasionally delayed, but nevertheless electric, even through the brunch noise. Here was that delight, again, in a place I didn\u2019t expect. I thought about the stories I had wanted to share when I first began writing. And watching you through a smaller screen, I wondered if my distance from your bigger headlines demanded something much greater than what I could give \u2014 a distance I wasn\u2019t confident I could close.\u00a0\nSo call me lazy or stale, unambitious at most. But I felt happy when I went to a soccer game with nothing to write. This wasn\u2019t work, but a passion enjoyed. No deadline to race, no weaving of nuanced questions for interviews, nor a fiery stance on zonal marking versus man-to-man to prove I know what I\u2019m talking about. I stood in the stands as just a fan of you. I rooted for a side, ignored the names of away team substitutions, and the delight of you returned.\nI couldn\u2019t become that trailblazer you craved. But now I\u2019ll settle for the gallery afar, watching you continue to flourish for your favorite kind of crowd. So let me flourish, too. I won\u2019t give all my words to you anymore \u2014 even if everything about you seemed so ideal in those evening hours, when the sun would set over the Schuylkill as the timeclock inched down, and the players on the field continued to just run, chasing you and one another into the back of that white net, and I was the one there to write about it all. You were a thrill unmatched, even as my own feet stood still.

          "article_content": "If you\u2019re reading this self-serving trip down memory lane, you might be one of my friends and family. Or, more likely, you\u2019re trying to read about the encampment and got lost on The Daily Pennsylvanian\u2019s website.\nIf you\u2019re in the latter camp, just hit the menu button on the top left and go to news. And if you\u2019re reading this in the physical paper \u2026 Who am I kidding, nobody actually picks up one of those. But if you\u2019re one of my friends and family, I\u2019m going to tell a story you might have already heard. Bear with me.\n\t\tWhile I was sports editor, a group of us made the seven-hour commute to Hanover, N.H., to cover a football game at Dartmouth College. At the time, we did a \u201cPicks are In\u201d column, where we\u2019d predict each week\u2019s game. All but one of our writers picked Dartmouth, who were 11.5-point favorites.\u00a0\nCut to: Penn somehow wins in double overtime, I\u2019m in the process of writing what will become an extremely mediocre recap, and we\u2019re sitting in a nearly empty press conference waiting to speak to Penn\u2019s coach.\n\t\t\n\t\nOne of us eventually asked him, \u201cWhat message do you think this win sends to the rest of the Ivy League?\u201d While staring directly at us, he said, \u201cI don\u2019t think anyone gave us a chance today... People were writing stories without giving us Quakers a chance. So message: We are 3-0, ready to play another game next week.\u201d\u00a0\nI checked. We were the only ones that had written a word about this game.\n\tWe, a group of 20-year-olds, had published something that pissed off a Division I football coach, and when we were proven wrong, he rightly told us to our faces.\nIt was completely fair for him \u2014 who, I should mention, is a very nice guy \u2014 to call us out. And it gets at a key aspect of college sports journalism: It can be very bizarre.\u00a0\nOne time, I was covering a road football game from my room. I watched the game on TV, and a buddy of mine came in and watched with me. With 10 minutes to go, we were talking about a Penn running back that was tearing through Cornell\u2019s defense.\n\u201cOh yeah,\u201d I said. \u201cI'll probably talk to him.\u201d\nI was on the phone with the running back a little over 10 minutes later. As my friend sat bemused on my couch, the guy who just charged through linemen on my TV was on the phone with me so I could mumble disjointed questions at him.\nAgain, bizarre.\nFormer Sports Editor Brandon Pride and I once traveled to New York for a baseball series at Columbia University. In the second game of the series, Penn blew a six-run lead in the last couple innings and lost on a walk-off homer.\nRough way to lose. And rough for Brandon and me, who now had to talk to the coach about their collapse.\u00a0\nWe waited as the team emerged from the dugout, terrified of having to confront a coach whose team just lost in the worst way imaginable. As he came out, we told him who we were, and he quickly exclaimed, \u201cOh wow, thanks for coming out, guys!\u201d and couldn\u2019t have been any nicer.\nYou never know what to expect from the people you\u2019re interviewing. Like how you don\u2019t expect Rick Pitino to tell you and the rest of a cramped postgame press conference about how the NCAA got its comeuppance in his infamous \u201cladies of the night\u201d investigation.\nBut that\u2019s part of what makes this very specific brand of journalism so great, and the memories I have from it are some of the best from my time in college.\nAfter that Dartmouth game, we drove 45 minutes in the middle of the night to a place called \u201cD Acres Permaculture Farm & Educational Homestead.\u201d\nIf that sounds like it\u2019s not a luxury hotel, you would be correct. I\u2019d waited till the last couple days before our trip to book a hotel. Much to my surprise, it was Family Weekend at Dartmouth, which meant that all the hotels in Hanover were full. The only one available was D Acres, located more or less in the middle of nowhere.\u00a0\nIt was cheap, so D Acres had that going for it.\nWe drove up around midnight to what looked like a haunted house, unsure if we\u2019d end up sleeping in the car. To our surprise, it was actually quite nice. The room next to the kitchen was for butchering pigs, and you needed to pay with quarters to shower. But the beds were comfy, and we weren\u2019t in a tent like the website suggested we might be.\nFor less than $60 a person, it was a good value. Plus, like many trips, it was a night with friends that I\u2019ll never forget.\n\n\n\n\n                Photos courtesy of Matthew Frank\n      \n\n\nI\u2019ve written over 120 articles for the DP (yikes), and although a couple of those were actually pretty good, it\u2019s the memories and the friends that I\u2019ll be most proud of and thankful for about my time in DPOSTM (The DP\u2019s Only Section That Matters, for the uninformed).\nI\u2019m thankful for the guys on Sunday Shift\u2122, for being the only reason I\u2019d ever wake up before noon on a Sunday. And Jonah and the other non-DPOSTMites who made late nights in the office not so miserable.\u00a0\n\t\tGet our newsletter, DP Daybreak, delivered to your inbox every weekday morning.I\u2019m appreciative of my non-DP friends, for constantly putting up with my \u201cSorry, I can\u2019t.

          "title": "Fiona Miller | Ambitions, amnesia, and ambivalence",
          "article_content": "When senior spring rolled around, a warning email from Career Advising landed in my inbox. URGENT. Apparently, my current enrollments would not complete my degree requirements. Apparently, I wouldn\u2019t graduate. As always, procrastination came back to bite me.\n\u201cSocial Impact and Responsibility: Foundations\u201d: the last class I needed to complete my concentration. As the name suggests, the course was meant to be entry-level, taken at the beginning of my academic journey, not at the tail end. Every semester, I pushed this three-hour seminar off. I could push it off no longer.\n\t\tAfter an email with my advisor, who not-so-politely suggested that I should have planned my course load better, I finally enrolled in Social Impact Foundations during my senior spring. A three-hour seminar, a foundations course as a senior \u2014 I couldn\u2019t wait.\nThe first assignment for the cursed course \u2014 which, due to my late enrollment, would be submitted well past the due date \u2014 was a legacy paper. In 2050, when you look back at your life (both personal and professional) what will you consider to be your main achievement \u2014 your legacy?\u00a0\nTo some, this assignment would kindly be referred to as easy and unkindly referred to as busy work. To a senior soon to be facing the real world, legacy was terrifying. All that mattered was what immediately lied in front of me: graduating, getting a job, getting into law school. I was too young to think about myself at age 48, and it was way too early to cement my legacy.\nLegacy? So terrified by this word, I had actually enrolled in and immediately dropped this course a year prior. Now, I was backed into a corner and forced to face my legacy head-on. I debated dropping my concentration entirely, but that meant admitting defeat to my concentration advisor. So I stayed in the course, mostly out of stubbornness and partly out of spite.\u00a0\n\tI began thinking back to the dreams I wrote about in my college application. Who was I when I came here?\nAt 18, I told my dad I wasn\u2019t applying to Penn. Why bother if there was no chance I would get in? In southwest Virginia, most of my peers would stay in-state or head down to Southeastern Conference schools. No one from my area had been to Penn in recent years; Philadelphia was a strange new land.\u00a0\nMy dad disagreed. Spoken like a recreational soccer coach, he replied: \u201cYou miss 100% of the shots you don\u2019t take.\u201d The what-ifs loomed too large to brush off. Hours before the deadline, I submitted my Wharton application. When decision day rolled around, my family and I jumped up and down in excitement \u2014 not over an acceptance, but over a spot on the waitlist. My shot in the dark was met with a wait and see, a more favorable outcome than a rejection. By a mix of luck, chance, and the rise of COVID-19 gap years, I was ultimately accepted. And with the payment of my deposit, Pandora\u2019s box was opened.\nAt 18, I knew all the numbers about Penn: rankings, post-graduate outcomes, CU limits, and course requirements. Over time, numbers became my litmus test. Numbers assured me I was on the right track. Apply for five clubs, like everyone else. Apply for dozens and dozens of internships, like everyone else. Stop sleeping eight hours a night \u2014 no one else does.\nEach year, the numbers told me there was more I could do. Another club, another leadership position, a more challenging minor, a more challenging career. Each NSO, I felt like Sisyphus, with any progress I made erased by another tick of the clock. The numbers stretched on. Better to have two internship offers than one, better to have three leadership positions than two, better to have four A\u2019s than three A minuses\u2026\u00a0\nLiving by the numbers was no way to live. Constantly comparing myself to my successful classmates was productive to no one and crippling to myself. At some point \u2014 far too late in my college career \u2014 I stopped trying to fit a standard I didn\u2019t believe in. Far too late, I resuscitated my ambitions from amnesia.\u00a0\nFlashing forward, I returned to the legacy paper. I knew the sources of my unhappiness at Penn. I knew I hated the numbers, the never-ending comparisons. Most importantly, I knew who I didn\u2019t want to be. For now, that could be enough. I wrote the legacy paper. I stayed in the three-hour seminar. I will graduate with the concentration that I applied to Penn with.\u00a0\n\t\tGet our newsletter, DP Daybreak, delivered to your inbox every weekday morning.As seniors know, much of spring term is reminiscing and remembering: thinking back to first-year roommates, old friend groups, long-abandoned majors and minors, and pre-professional tracks. The legacy paper, the bane of my existence, forced me to look both backwards and forwards. The assignment made me face uncomfortable questions of \u201cWhat does success mean to you?\u201d and \u201cWho even are you, really?\u201d\u00a0\nLike most seniors, I don\u2019t really know the answers. I am graduating with a degree that claims I know something when really, I feel more confused than I did at 18. But if four years at Penn has taught me anything, it\u2019s this: Comparison is truly the thief of joy. The only thing comparison has taught me is who I don\u2019t want to be.\u00a0\nFIONA MILLER is a Wharton senior studying behavioral economics and social impact from Roanoke, Va.

          "article_content": "\u201c5 Fun Things To Do in Philadelphia,\u201d read the subject line of my most recent email.\u00a0\nSitting in my childhood bedroom back in 2020, I curiously pondered over this random email that landed in my inbox. With no connection to the city, I didn\u2019t understand why this was relevant to me. I almost ignored it, if not for my superwoman of a mother who reminded me that I was still on Penn\u2019s waitlist. I had previously concluded that Penn was no longer a possibility, but thankfully, my mom urged me to check the portal anyway.\u00a0\n\t\tMy screen was adorned with red and blue confetti \u2014 I had, in fact, been accepted to Penn. After re-reading the acceptance letter about 15 times to make sure my eyes were not deceiving me, my heart sank when I noticed the date. I was accepted over a week prior, but I had no idea because I missed the original email notification.\u00a0\nIf I had not seen the subsequent email advertising Philadelphia\u2019s main attractions, I may have missed the deadline to make an enrollment decision, or I may have never even known that I got into Penn. I was so grateful to still have the chance to attend this prestigious university despite being so irresponsible, and I made a promise to take advantage of every opportunity this school offered.\u00a0\n\t\t\n\t\nAnd that I did.\u00a0\nMy Penn experience has been nothing short of fulfilling. Though my first year was characterized by measures of isolation (virtual classes, mandatory masks, grab-and-go dining), I had never felt more connected with others. Call it trauma bonding, but there is something unifying about being a \u201cCOVID freshman\u201d that only the Class of 2024 could ever understand.\n\tMy first year was also the time when I joined The Daily Pennsylvanian as an opinion columnist, and over the next four years, I would write, edit, podcast, and even create crossword puzzles. I learned how to navigate ruthless backlash from readers attacking my character and my intellect, and I served as a deputy editor during one of the most polarizing times in DP history \u2014 two formative experiences that have shaped who I am as a person and a writer. I credit the DP for planting the seeds of my future in journalism, and I would not have had the privilege of working for NBC News, CNN, and ABC News without my roots here.\u00a0\nAside from the career benefits, writing for the DP also presented opportunities to unravel years of internalized racism. My articles about Asian hate and xenophobia in Congress may not seem significant to the average reader, but this represented a huge step forward in not only accepting my racial identity, but being proud to publicly defend it. Coming from a predominantly white neighborhood and high school, I never truly felt comfortable in my own skin and even cringed at my culture. I am ashamed to admit this now, but I sought to assimilate by subconsciously surrounding myself with white friends, American cuisine, and white norms.\u00a0\nWhile this may sound like an absurd paradox, joining a sorority further prompted me to embrace my Asian identity. I began to see Asian women engaging in social endeavors and being welcomed in spaces that I had previously assumed were exclusive to white individuals. And though Greek life undoubtedly has a litany of faults in regards to diversity and inclusion, I do credit Penn\u2019s chapter of Alpha Phi for providing my first friendships with girls that actually looked like me. I have had some of the deepest conversations with these women regarding shared backgrounds, childhood similarities, and generational differences \u2014 topics that I never even fathomed to touch on beforehand.\u00a0\nThese social interactions remain my most treasured takeaway from college. Of course, all the sweaty frat basements, overpriced downtown events, and BYO dinners are core memories in my Penn experience. But rather than reminiscing about these drunken nights, I am more proud of the friendships that these social outings have rewarded me with. I have met my best friends that know me better than I know myself, some of whom I would quite literally consider to be family. I have learned about love and loyalty, support and sacrifice, trauma and tragedy.\nMy friends have also inspired me in a myriad of ways, and I\u2019ll never tire of watching them launch companies, save lives, and change the world. They dedicate their hearts and souls to every endeavor, including athletics, the arts, and other extracurricular activities. In fact, witnessing my peers\u2019 passions has served to revitalize my own. As a competitive figure skater for over 12 years who suffered from burnout and grew to despise the sport, I refused to step foot on the ice again. Though I joined the Penn Figure Skating Club during the fall of my first year, it was not until senior spring (seven semesters later) that I visited the Penn Ice Rink for the very first time. I regret how long it has taken, but it has been a beautiful journey receiving such profound support and falling back in love with the sport that defined me for over a decade.\u00a0\n\t\tGet our newsletter, DP Daybreak, delivered to your inbox every weekday morning.I could go on and on about the many things that Penn has taught me, but my mind always goes back to the day I discovered my Penn acceptance and the panic that ensued after realizing I opened the letter a week late. I often think about how different my life would have been had I continued to neglect my inbox, and I always come to the same conclusion: none of these experiences would have been the same, and many of these life lessons may have never come to fruition.\u00a0\nSo if there\u2019s one piece of advice I have to give, it is to check your email.

          "article_content": "Opinion applications for The Daily Pennsylvanian were due on a rainy, pandemic-era September day. Zoning out in a Zoom lecture, I wondered if I really wanted to put the effort into penning a sample column. Wouldn\u2019t I just get rejected?\nBut then I remembered what Mr. Henderson, my high school English teacher, wrote to me that spring. He said he associated me with the newspaper, complimenting my writing style and how I gave my all on every assignment. If at least one person thought that I belonged at the paper, I may as well give it my best shot.\u00a0\n\t\tIt\u2019s a pretty solid call to adventure, don\u2019t you think?\nWhen I started writing columns, I was scared stiff of saying something that would get construed the wrong way. I reviewed every last letter and punctuation mark of my drafts, and asked my friends to do the same. With that diligence, I grew as a writer. I started speaking up in meetings, and then, in my junior year, I led them as the opinion editor.\u00a0\n\t\t\n\t\nFor the longest time, I chose to interpret my time at Penn, and at the DP, as a kind of hero\u2019s journey, where I finish demanding assignments with aplomb, and every adversity teaches me a valuable lesson. Most of us do some version of that. We hope to graduate feeling triumphant, having risen through the ranks and gained expertise in the activities and academics that we invested in. We hope that our next steps involve a dream job or school \u2014 a dream life, even.\nI entered Penn my senior fall, eager to get my storybook resolution come graduation. Leaving my summer internship with glowing reviews from my mentors, I was assured of a return offer. And having made a pact with my friends to take no more than 5.5 CUs, I would be coasting, relative to my earlier 6.5 and 7 CU terms as a dual-degree student. This was the term where, instead of learning the ropes of Penn and fighting to stay afloat, I would explore and navigate new waters.\u00a0\n\tBut then, as the clock struck midnight and September began, my email inbox greeted me with a \u201cwe regret to inform you\u201d message from the company I had interned at \u2014 the first of many, many eventful emails in my inbox. I dropped down to 4.5 CUs after struggling with a coding assignment for 20-something hours, but my workload hardly let up after that.\nOver the following months, 30 and 40-hour weeks at the DP became my norm: speaking with our (incredibly, insanely dedicated) staffers and editing and fact-checking columns. I was hopping on phone calls and writing replies to email chains, dozens of messages deep in the middle of the night. By the end of the year, Opinion published over 200 staff and guest columns with diverse perspectives on campus life and current events \u2014 there is nothing I am prouder of having worked on at Penn.\nNone of it would have been possible without the immense support and kindness from so many wonderful, driven people. Thank you Emi, Imran, and Jesse \u2014 in the most tumultuous of times in the Pink Palace, I could count on you to advocate for Opinion and to give your all into leading the DP, which means more than words can express. Thank you Yomi, Vinay, and Emily for being the absolute best deputy editors Opinion 139 could ask for, and Matteo, for your careful sensitivity reading and suggestions. Thank you Derek, Benjamin, and all of Photo and Design for the beautiful doms, and for goofing off with me during production nights. Thank you Allyson, Julia, and all of Copy! You are the backbone of the DP.\nAnd of course, I am most grateful for the wit, enthusiasm, and commitment of every single columnist I have had the privilege to work with; your stories captivated thousands of minds and inspired countless debates.\nIf I was still going after that storybook resolution, I\u2019d tell you that upon retirement from the DP, I rode off into the sunset to some magnificent end-credits-style music. At our banquet, I was honored to receive the Editor of the Year award, and after applying to full-time positions for months, I suddenly had to decide between three great job offers over the span of two weeks.\nBut it\u2019s not all that simple \u2014 I\u2019ve learned this spring that 5.5 CUs can feel just as soul-sucking as 7 (thanks, NETS 2120), and I\u2019ve had my fair share of tough conversations, embarrassing slip-ups, and everyday misfortunes. With the turmoil and tensions both on campus and worldwide right now, it feels disingenuous to tell a story where everything wraps up neatly, with no loose ends.\nI said before that in a hero\u2019s journey, each adversity teaches you a lesson \u2014 but that\u2019s not how life actually works. Sometimes, you just screw up, for no reason other than bad luck or a bout of clumsiness. Sometimes, there\u2019s no purpose to it: only pain.\nBecause of that, I\u2019ve given up on the hero\u2019s journey altogether. Shifting away from grandiose but precarious narratives that hinge on external validation, like acceptances and awards, I now prefer to focus my story on the day-to-day minutiae that bring me joy and stability. It is filled with lovely little moments, like chatting with my roommates over spicy, piping-hot bowls of instant ramen, or taking in the fresh air and ambiance as I walk through the Woodlands.\u00a0\n\t\tGet our newsletter, DP Daybreak, delivered to your inbox every weekday morning.My life feels far fuller with this type of story than when I\u2019ve tried to contort my time at Penn into a narrative with some meaningful conclusion to it all. I have flourished in many ways here. But in others, I am very much a work-in-progress, and that\u2019s perfectly fine. I hope that you will come to adapt your stories as you grow and change too \u2014 sticking with a rigid narrative for too long is no fun.\nI suppose I\u2019ll end here on the same line that got me into this whole (glorious) mess in hopes that it inspires somebody else: whoever you are, if you so desire, you can belong at the paper. Start writing stories, and never stop. Be curious and skeptical about every narrative you examine \u2014 ask lots of questions and raise objections when you see fit. You\u2019re going to be brilliant.\nCAROLINE MAGDOLEN is a College and Engineering senior studying earth science and systems engineering from New York City.

          "title": "Riane Lumer | The social clock is ticking, according to who?",
          "article_content": "Five years ago during a college tour trip, I vividly recall sitting in a hotel, gazing out the window at the skyline of Boston. I felt inspired; I was eager to write my supplemental essays about why I wanted to attend Boston College (BC), and why I wanted to become a teacher. BC\u2019s Lynch School of Education and Human Development attracted me because of its education program.\nThis tour was a few weeks before I was selected to present a speech at the back-to-school convocation in front of every K-12 teacher in the district on my passions for education and teaching. Becoming a teacher was a personality trait for me. \u201cMost likely to become part of Lower Moreland Faculty: Riane Lumer.\u201d I even won a scholarship award for someone potentially entering the field of education. \u201cWe\u2019ll be colleagues one day!\u201d my choir director constantly joked my senior year. \u201cYou\u2019ll take over the organization in the future,\u201d my Mini-THON advisor told me.\u00a0\n\t\tI had wanted to be an English teacher since I was in fifth grade \u2014 or so I thought.\nMy sophomore year at BC, I student-taught at Brighton High School, a turnaround Boston public school in Massachusetts. This was something I was itching to do throughout my first year. I just wanted to get in the classroom.\u00a0\n\t\t\n\t\nLike most city schools, students in the urban district are victims of pervasive systemic disparities that contribute to educational debt. I recognized this upon the first day of my pre-practicum and felt a need to assist on a political level. My passion for reform only intensified after more time connecting with students.\u00a0\nBut this desire extends beyond the role of a teacher. \u201cThere\u2019s only so much a teacher can do within the classroom for change,\u201d I thought to myself.\u00a0\n\tAnd so, after a month of teaching, I began to heavily question a future in it. That frightened me\u00a0\u2014 leading me to suppress these feelings until the end of the semester, when I truly began to consider that this really wasn\u2019t the path for me. I didn\u2019t want to swallow that pill. I didn\u2019t think I knew myself without it.\nI was grieving a dream that died, a future for myself that no longer matched what I had imagined for years. New experiences and exposures changed me and sparked bigger aspirations. But I also felt as though I failed myself; my family always told me teaching wasn\u2019t for me, and I thought I was rebelling. Well, they were right, but for different reasons.\u00a0\nI added a third major: political science. But I was faced with another dilemma. The licensure teaching program at BC was the last thing keeping me there. And the summer prior to that, the excitement for student-teaching and jump-starting my career in education counteracted my detached emotions toward the atmosphere of BC.\u00a0\nI applied to transfer to NYU during the spring semester of my sophomore year. I enrolled in their education school, but I didn\u2019t attend. I wanted to give BC one more shot: it was my top choice, and I wanted it to feel the way I expected. And I wanted my zeal for teaching to return, because that was all I thought I knew and was attached to. That linear path was comforting to me. It was something that I felt was within my grasp and control.\nOn May 18, 2022, I received my acceptance to Penn as a junior transfer majoring in political science. Yes, a junior transfer who also was entering with a new major that they had only taken one course for at their prior institution.\u00a0\nEmbracing my desire to transfer and reshape my career trajectory ignited my newfound eagerness to continuously explore new avenues that ignite my joy and curiosity. When I got onto Penn\u2019s campus, I applied to join The Daily Pennsylvanian\u2019s opinion and podcast departments and became a writer for 34th Street Magazine. At BC, I was involved primarily in educationally-oriented activities. It was my whole world; anything like writing for the student newspaper felt irrelevant to my future career. I was wrong and naive. And I ended up writing about it.\u00a0\nBecause of my experiences at the DP and with my journalistic writing minor, I explored the world of journalism \u2014 a discipline one of my English professors at BC suggested would be a good fit for me. But I refused to depart from what I thought was my path, until my college experience took an unexpected turn on its head.\u00a0\nCurrently, I\u2019m unsure exactly what the future holds for me, but I am learning to find peace in all of the possibilities. When I transferred, I abandoned the habit of attempting to assume control over every aspect of my life and plan each detail. Instead, I embrace the uncertainty of the future and approach my twenties as a blank canvas, ready to be painted with new experiences and opportunities.\u00a0\nMy college experience has been anything but conventional. Although I will be walking across the stage this month, I will not be officially graduating until December \u2014 another detour from what I expected when transferring to Penn and assuming I would \u201cgraduate on time.\u201d\nWhen I met with my advisor and he broke the news to me that I would not be graduating \u201con time,\u201d I panicked and my stomach dropped. Instinctively, I felt that I was falling behind. But in the aftermath of that moment, I began to question the concept of \u201con time.\u201d What does it truly mean? Especially for me? I realized that this phrase carries little significance \u2014 it's more about when things unfold as they're meant to. The right time is when it happens, and this fall, I will be embarking on another chapter by participating in the Penn in Washington program in D.C. (another transfer application bucket list item!).\u00a0\nThe social clock, a sociological theory identified by Bernice Neugarten, is a timetable of expectations for reaching milestones in your life predicated on external pressures and cultural norms embedded into societal structures. But as I have come to view it, the pressures of the social clock can seep into every level of decision-making in your life, if you allow it to sway you in determining how to act according to what you believe society would expect of you, or adhering to what others are doing around you.\u00a0\nI fell victim to this when experiencing dilemmas about my future. Now, I check myself as I fall into its harmful cycles time and time again. During rush, girls consistently asked me what post-grad job I had lined up or where I would be living. I didn\u2019t know, but I was no longer embarrassed. Everyone has their own timelines, and we are all working to figure them out. The rigorous, hyper-competitive nature of Penn especially subscribes to the demands of the social clock, so beware.\u00a0\nI find that the best way to withdraw yourself from this phenomenon is to know yourself. To listen to yourself. I encourage you to ask yourself, who are you? What sparks your curiosity? What excites you? What makes you tick? Are you driven by passions you have developed, or are you driven to fit the mold of what you think society expects of you?\u00a0\nAs I write this on my last day of classes at Penn, I sit at my desk reflecting on the past two years of my journey while a mug gifted from Penn\u2019s Transfer Student Organization to seniors sits next to my computer reading, \u201cI survived transferring.\u201d\u00a0\n\t\tGet our newsletter, DP Daybreak, delivered to your inbox every weekday morning.Yes, I did. But more importantly, I've transformed into a person I never envisioned \u2014\u00a0I was so overly fixated on preserving what felt safe and comfortable that I lost sight of who I was actually evolving into. \u00a0\nI leave with a reminder to my future self and to all of you: It's okay to outgrow places, people, things, habits, visions, or worldviews. Don't feel guilty about change and growth \u2014 untether yourself as you enter into new phases.

          "article_content": "Of the dozens of campus tours I\u2019ve given for the Kite and Key Society, each one has been different. I\u2019d switch out old stories for new ones or change how I\u2019d present information to prospective students and their families. The start of my tours, however, always remained the same:\n\"Penn was founded in 1740 by Benjamin Franklin. He was a founding father of the United States, printer, inventor, and so much more. Franklin didn\u2019t like to be defined by just one thing, and that\u2019s the spirit we love to embody through interdisciplinary experiences here at Penn.\"\n\t\tI said these lines almost every week for my three years as a tour guide, yet I never thought of internalizing them myself. Even though I had varying interests both inside and outside of the classroom, I defined my identity as the girl who worked for The Daily Pennsylvanian for the majority of my time as a Penn student.\nThe DP was the first organization that I joined at Penn. As a lonely first-year student going stir-crazy in my bedroom due to the COVID-19 pandemic, I elected to join a club during my spring semester to give myself something to do outside of my schoolwork. After aimlessly scrolling through the Penn Clubs website, I stumbled upon the DP\u2019s page. My high school didn\u2019t have a newspaper, so I was weary of writing. But I\u2019ve always loved grammar. Thus, my love of copy editing was born.\n\t\t\t\tSEE MORE FROM ALLYSON NELSON:\ufeffPenn softball swept by Harvard'A perfect fit': Penn softball's Megan Huang is off to a strong startEverything after that point was a blur. I entered the DP\u2019s Pink Palace for the first time when COVID-19 restrictions were lifted, learned the intricacies of fact-checking and style editing, and realized that I was part of something much bigger than myself. I sought leadership as soon as I was able, and before I knew it, my entire world revolved around the DP.\nI prioritized the DP above all else. I\u2019d push off assignments to edit articles, tune out in class to look over a breaking story and cancel plans with friends to take on extra DP work. Even as a deputy copy editor, the DP was a full-time job. And when I finally became one of the two head copy editors on the 139th Board, I felt like I was always working overtime. If I wasn\u2019t actively editing, I was thinking about the DP. I kept my phone on me at all times, anxious that a breaking story would suddenly come through and I\u2019d need to edit at a moment\u2019s notice.\n\tIt slowly dawned on me after my first semester as copy editor that this life was no longer sustainable. The DP was negatively impacting my academic life, personal relationships, and mental health, and there was only so much more I could handle. Coinciding with the fact that I had just been elected summer executive editor \u2014 meaning I hadn\u2019t taken any extended time off from the DP in two years \u2014 I knew that I needed change. So what did I do? I accepted leadership positions in other clubs alongside my work at the DP.\nTo the naked eye, this decision seemed insane. But what I realized in my first semester as copy editor is that I didn\u2019t know how to tell the DP no. I took on work that I didn\u2019t have to simply because I didn\u2019t have a reason not to. With new responsibilities elsewhere on campus, particularly with Kite and Key and Social Planning and Events Committee Connaissance, I learned that it was okay to take time away from the DP to pursue other opportunities that excited me. These leadership roles taught me how to manage over 100 people, plan large-scale events, and work with major Penn offices, which is something I did not have the ability to do at the DP.\nThis was one of the best decisions I\u2019ve ever made at Penn. Finding other communities on campus made me realize how much I loved the DP. That\u2019s not to say that my other communities were lesser than \u2014 they certainly weren\u2019t \u2014 but taking a step back from the DP allowed me to appreciate the work that I was beginning to resent. I didn\u2019t always groan when a new article to edit was sent to me, nor would I dread having to go into the office. For the first time in a while, I was excited about the DP.\nThis new perspective allowed me to grow even closer with my DP community. My love had never waivered for them before, but my changed outlook made me appreciate their support so much more. It takes a village to keep the DP going, and I am so grateful that I got to work alongside some of the most passionate and motivated people at Penn.\nJulia was the best co-copy editor I could ask for, and our work would not have been possible without the dedication of our wonderful copy deputies \u2014 Charlotte, Diamy, Eleanor, Laura, Maddie, and Riley \u2014 and our equally amazing copy associates. Emi, Imran, and Walden were such strong leaders throughout my time on board, and they believed in me when I could not believe in myself. I am also thankful for Alexis and Caleb, the 139 sports editors, who welcomed me with open arms when I wanted to give sports writing a try as a junior.\n\t\tGet our newsletter, DP Daybreak, delivered to your inbox every weekday morning.My time at the DP would not have been possible without the people who came before me. I am grateful for my copy editor predecessors, Brittany and Sophie, and am also thankful for Delaney, Jonah, and Tyler, who started as my mentors but ended up becoming my closest friends.\nI always ended my tours by saying that if I had to go through the college application process 100 times over, I\u2019d still choose Penn every time. The same goes for the DP. My time in the Pink Palace taught me to be detail-oriented, how to work under pressure, compromise with people who you may not agree with, and \u2014 most importantly \u2014 the difference between an em-dash and an en-dash. Despite the bumps in the road, I\u2019m so glad that the DP was the headline of my Penn experience \u2014 even if it took me time to appreciate it fully.\nALLYSON NELSON is a College senior studying English and American history from Philadelphia.

          "title": "Tulia Falleti | The aftermath I had feared is here",
          "article_content": "Guest columnist Tulia Falleti writes to resign from the position of Chair of the Faculty Senate.Early on the morning of May 10, in less than one hour, the Philadelphia police removed the Gaza Solidarity Encampment protesters from the College Green of our campus. Penn students, staff, and faculty, with their hands zip-tied behind their backs, were separated one by one from those embracing them as they sat on the ground or locked arms around the iconic Ben Franklin statue. Not a punch or a rock was thrown; no one so much as spat.\u00a0\nSince April 25, as Chair of the Faculty Senate, I have observed the encampment, walking by its perimeter several times a day. It was a peaceful protest. I wrote so in a guest column published in The Daily Pennsylvanian on May 4, and I stand by my assessment. On May 6, during one of my visits to the perimeter of the encampment, I noticed a person standing behind the white board that announced the events for the day. I entered the encampment a few feet to read the back of the white board. Listed there were 14 \u201cCommunity Guidelines and Principles.\u201d Number 10 read: \u201cDo not engage with counter-protesters or bad-faith agitators.\u201d\u00a0\n\t\tDuring the two weeks of the encampment, despite events of individualized harassment and intimidation against protesters that were reported to the Penn police and to the Committee on Open Expression, protesters remained non-violent. The speed with which the police were able to dismantle the protest is itself evidence of the protesters\u2019 refusal to resort to violence. Members of our community who characterize chants, signs, flags, even graffiti (which our student protesters covered and asked to be removed) or paint on our beloved founder Ben Franklin\u2019s statue as forms of violence need to turn on their TVs and tune in to violent protests or war scenes from around the world. We can certainly talk about symbolic violence or of hurtful forms of expression, but no one in our campus can say that the encampment that was on College Green from April 25 until this morning \u2014 and that included not only Penn members but also members of the larger Philadelphia community \u2014 has caused any physical harm or physical violence.\u00a0\nThe encampment grew on the evening of May 8, which was of great concern to me. In a worldwide, student-led social movement, in which the encampment \u2014 i.e. peaceful protest with tents \u2014 is a strategy for protest or part of its main repertoire, its modus operandi, and is the only bargaining power that protesters have, the growth of the encampment\u2019s footprint could only indicate one reality: negotiations with the University administration were not progressing. Was the University negotiating in good faith and with respect for the student protesters as our former President Sheldon Hackney had done when negotiating divestment from South Africa in the early 1980s? I could not tell. Did the encampment occupy part of our University\u2019s lawns? Yes, a tiny fraction of those campus properties on which the institution does not pay property taxes and which expand over a significant part of West Philadelphia. Was it disruptive to our educational mission? No, it was not. The building closest to the encampment, College Hall, is under construction, and as of May 1, there are no more classes on campus. Van Pelt Library is across from the encampment, but even when the chants were at some of their highest volume, our students were studying undisturbed in the library. Students also took graduation photos around the encampment, both in front of College Hall and at the Button and the LOVE statue. It was only on the evenings of May 8 (when negotiations had stopped) and May 9 and this morning that university operations were interrupted as the University prepared to clear the encampment. Had the University taken a different approach, our educational activities and access to buildings would have continued uninterrupted.\u00a0\n\t\t\n\t\nI was ending my first year of high school when the last military dictatorship came to an end in my native Argentina. The following year, with my fellow high-school students, we were able to do what the generation before ours could not: We could go into the streets and protest, and we could also occupy our buildings in protest. The generation before mine had been arrested, killed, and disappeared for protesting \u2014 even when the cause was free public transit rides for students. Thanks to our newly regained democracy, my classmates and I could join almost weekly protests in support of democracy, of human rights, of justice, or workers\u2019 rights. And our sit-ins and building occupations always ended with good faith negotiations, never by force. Those were formative political experiences that shaped my future civic and political life and oriented me toward becoming a social scientist and an educator.\u00a0\nToday, I am heartbroken that my university, the institution where I have taught, carried out my research, and worked in service of our students, staff, and faculty in myriad ways for over twenty years, has decided to send in the police to arrest its own students, staff, and faculty. I have been asked if I would hold the same position if the protesters were part of a worldwide encampment movement that was pro-abortion or against immigration. My answer is unequivocally \u201cYes!\u201d I would defend and uphold their right to peacefully protest, because this is a fundamental bedrock right of democracy. The fact that this protest \u2014 like the Occupy Wall Street or the rent protest movements before \u2014 used tents should have led our university community to talk about our land, how we occupy it, how it is taxed (or not) by our city, how it serves our mission, and how we use it. At this precise moment, in fact, the construction work that is going on around College Hall has occupied a larger footprint of our College Green area than the encampment did. Moreover, unlike other universities that use their main green area for graduation, we hold our convocations and graduations in our football stadium, so there was no reason to rush to remove the encampment as the semester came to an end and graduation was due to take place in ten days and over two blocks from College Green. The fact that there were Penn students, staff, and faculty complaining about speech content should have led to discussions about free speech, not censorship. And the fact that order is \u201crestored\u201d by sacrificing rights to free speech and to non-violent protest is exactly what autocracies around the world do now and what dictatorships have done throughout history to repress civic movements and suppress rights. Moreover, the decision itself is shortsighted. The encampment can be removed today, but the worldwide student-led movement will not end.\u00a0\n\tAccording to our rules, as Chair of the Faculty Senate I was not elected but appointed instead by a small Nominating Committee of nine peers. This undemocratic process notwithstanding, I am confident that by upholding our rules and procedures, I could have continued to strive to represent the vast majority of the members of the standing faculty at Penn. For instance, our Senate Executive Committee agreed yesterday to encourage \u201cboth\u00a0the\u00a0administration\u00a0and\u00a0the negotiating team of the student-led movement\u00a0to\u00a0keep\u00a0negotiating\u00a0in\u00a0good\u00a0faith, to de-escalate, and to seek a peaceful resolution.\u201d I would have been thrilled to carry that message if there was anyone to hear it today. I am, however, no longer confident of my ability to work collaboratively with our administration that has sent in the police to arrest its own students, staff, and faculty for participating in a non-violent protest. Thus, I am hereby presenting my resignation as Chair of the Faculty Senate of the University of Pennsylvania.\u00a0\nAs a member of the standing faculty, I will continue to defend academic freedom, free speech, and due process at our university. After serving as Chair-elect and then Chair of the Faculty Senate during the last two years, I am more aware and cognizant than ever of our Faculty Handbook, our Statutes of the Trustees (in particular, Article 11), our essential Guidelines on Open Expression, our carefully structured disciplinary processes for students, our need for academic freedom, and the importance of our shared governance. I am also keenly aware of the challenges that our University has faced in the last year and that are of public knowledge. As two colleagues have recently argued, our University\u2019s rules have been written in times of calm to be applied in times of upheaval. As a faculty member, I will make every effort to ensure that our rules and procedures are followed without bias and without manipulation. That our students, staff, and faculty are treated fairly. If universities such as Penn become one-sided, partisan, and biased, if they give in to external pressures for either political or financial reasons, then there is no hope for higher education in this country or the world. The larger threat is to democracy itself, because such manipulation of our rules, policies, and procedures can only take place in non-democratic institutions.\u00a0\nI leave my leadership role in the Faculty Senate with the following unsolicited words of advice to our administration, our Trustees, our boards\u2019 advisors, and to my fellow colleagues. It comes from our students: \u201cWe commit to assuming the best intentions, granting ourselves and others grace when mistakes are made and approaching conflict with the goal of addressing, repairing, and restoring.\u201d (Guideline number eight of the Penn encampment disbanded today.) May I have the wisdom of our students and future leaders to live up to this principle in the weeks and months to come, given the mistakes committed at Penn today.\u00a0\nTULIA FALLETI is a professor of political science and the former chair of the Faculty Senate.

          "title": "George Honig | It was a mistake to send in the police to end the encampment",
          "article_content": "As an alumnus of Penn, I received communication from the University a few days ago regarding the removal by Penn Police in riot gear (with the assistance of the Philadelphia Police Department) of the encampment of students protesting Israel's violations of the human rights of Palestinians in Gaza. The University's actions have not been fair or even-handed to these students, and I believe the administration is on the wrong side of history. \u00a0\nIn my view, the students\u2019 demands have been reasonable and just, as this war shows no signs of ending. On Oct. 7, a Hamas raid (which I have condemned) killed 1,100 Israelis. Today, Israel's eight-month military operations have killed 40,000 people, displaced nearly 2 million, and destroyed more than 50% of the buildings in Gaza. What Israel has done is not justice or defense, but rather barbarism and immorality by the standards of the Jewish, Christian, or Muslim religions, or by any reasonable standard of international law. It is for this reason that the International Court of Justice has allowed a case for genocide to proceed against Israel. \u00a0\n\t\tI was especially appalled that dozens of Penn faculty members traveled to Israel in January and met with Israeli President Isaac Herzog, who is specifically mentioned in the International Court of Justice finding. This is equivalent to a faculty member meeting with Vladimir Putin or Slobodan Milo\u0161evi\u0107. I cannot believe that any Arab, Palestinian, or Muslim student could think that they would be treated fairly by these faculty.\nTo say that Penn has been even-handed in its dealings with pro-Israeli and pro-Palestinian students is demonstrably false. Shortly after Oct. 7, Penn convened an antisemitism task force, which was done in partnership with the American Jewish Committee, and we have received continuous communication about this committee. I call on Penn to immediately establish a task force to specifically address Islamophobia and anti-Arab and anti-Palestinian racism on campus, and that this task force work in cooperation with the Council on American-Islamic Relations and the American-Arab Anti-Discrimination Committee. \u00a0\n\t\t\n\t\nI also call on Penn to evaluate investments in any activity which may violate human rights or international law. Such an approach needs to be applied to Israel in light of events in Gaza, but should also be applied to any other countries committing war crimes or human rights violations.\nThe demands of the students protesting on College Green were just by any reasonable standards. The University refused offers of mediation by several members of the Philadelphia City Council. Penn's actions do not enhance public safety and will produce a chilling effect on free speech in the future. I call on Penn to drop any charges against the students involved in the encampment, and apologize to the community for excessive use of force.\n\tI am currently a Platinum-level alumni donor to Penn. I am currently serving on the alumni admissions committee, and I am active in the Penn and Wharton clubs of Chicago. I will continue to support the University, but I want to reiterate how very disappointed I am in Penn's response to this crisis.\nGEORGE HONIG is a 1987 Wharton graduate.

First, we would like to thank Interim Penn President Larry Jameson and the administration, Penn Police, Philadelphia Mayor Cherelle Parker, and the Philadelphia Police Department for the effective, efficient, and professional clearing of the encampment to return our campus to a safe place for all students and faculty.\u00a0\nNobody wants our students to be harmed, and we do not wish to penalize anyone who is practicing their right to free expression. However, we are hopeful that the University will engage in a thorough and fair disciplinary process to ensure that students and faculty who are not adhering to the code of conduct face appropriate consequences for inciting hate and creating a threatening campus environment. This should apply to anyone fomenting hate and encouraging destruction of property. We recognize that many of these people are not students on this campus. We condemn any further escalation, especially by non-Penn agitators, and look forward to a safe and meaningful conclusion to the academic term, including long-awaited graduations, commencement, and class reunions.\u00a0\n\t\tWe welcome civil and respectful discussion. We advocate for the release of the hostages and elimination of Hamas and other organizations funded by terrorism as a critical goal to achieve in reaching an end to this war. We cannot move on as a community until we can come together as a community. The entire country is heartbroken that it has come to this with many of the college encampments, but the only way forward is to choose dialogue and understanding over hate.

          "article_content": "I often teach capstone research courses and supervise honors theses for the health & societies major. Some of my students use historical methods to answer their research questions. Occasionally, a student asking a historical question will explore The Daily Pennsylvanian's archives. My students have experienced surprise, delight, and sometimes shock when combing through old DP articles and learning about local, national, and international issues important to previous generations of Penn students.\nOver the past two weeks, I, like many other Penn faculty members, have deeply appreciated the professionalism and commitment of our student journalists. DP journalists have reported tirelessly about the encampment on our College Green.\n\t\tI was stunned, therefore, when I got to campus around 7:30 a.m. today, to see that police were not allowing DP reporters inside the barricade to report on the encampment removal. I asked two DP reporters and one DP photographer, who were being blocked by a line of police officers with batons, why they weren\u2019t being allowed in. \u201cThey don\u2019t take us seriously,\u201d one reporter replied. Meanwhile, I saw a reporter for a network news channel allowed to head up Locust Walk to College Green.\nA Philadelphia Inquirer article reported later today that another DP journalist, who arrived at College Green at 5 a.m. before the dismantling of the encampment began, was \u201cgrabbed by two Penn police officers and moved back from the statue. \u2018I kept saying I was a student and a member of the press,\u2019 the reporter said. \u2018I kept on asking why I wasn\u2019t allowed to be there, and I would get no responses.\u2019\u201d\n\t\t\n\t\nWhile I assume that at some point, the police must have allowed some members of the DP inside the barricade, I just want DP student journalists to know that I take you seriously.

          "article_content": "Professors Ann Farnsworth-Alvear and Zita Cristina Nunes urge us to read Penn\u2019s Guidelines on Open Expression, arguing that it would be a perversion of those guidelines for the University to discipline students organizing the encampment on College Green, or to take any measures to end the encampment other than negotiation with the protesters. I have taken their advice and read those Guidelines and find nothing that mandates negotiation as the only appropriate response by the University.\nFarnsworth-Alvear and Nunes cite the part of the Guidelines that states that \u201cIn case of conflict between the principles of the Guidelines on Open Expression and other University policies, the principles of the Guidelines shall take precedence,\u201d (Guidelines I.D), but they interpret this as if it meant that no University policy may be enforced if it restricts open expression by students. This is a misreading of that clause since that document itself makes reference to disciplinary procedures (Guidelines V.D) and mandates the University establish policies and procedures for securing permission to hold demonstrations on campus (Guidelines III.A.2.b). As I read Interim Penn President Larry Jameson\u2019s letter to the Penn community on May 6, the University has determined that the current encampment on College Green is in violation of those policies and procedures (among others), and has instructed the encampment to disperse (in line with Guidelines III.B and V.C). Since the protesters have not complied with this instruction (thus falling under Guidelines III.B), the disciplinary procedures invoked in Guidelines V.D come into play. The Guidelines also discuss the possibility of \u201c[t]erminating a meeting, event, or demonstration by force,\u201d (Guidelines V.C.4), about which it urges extreme caution, citing the possibility of exacerbating existing tensions, and the concern to avoid \u201cinjury to persons\u201d and \u201cproperty damage.\u201d\n\t\tMy point is that the University\u2019s current response to the encampment, which involves initiating the student disciplinary process against organizers yesterday, and using police to shut down the encampment this morning, is in line with its own Guidelines for Open Expression.\nSUSAN SAUV\u00c9 MEYER is a retired professor of philosophy.

          "title": "Ben Messafi | The encampment is self-destructing ",
          "article_content": "More than one week into the encampment on College Green, with over 150 incidents of antisemitism and harassment reported to Penn Hillel, the public endorsement of two United States-designated terrorist organizations, and two American flags planted near the encampment being forcibly removed and damaged by protesters, students have had enough. It is time to end this antisemitic and anti-American encampment now.\u00a0\nOn April 26, pro-Israeli and Jewish students sponsored a screening of the Oct. 7 massacre adjacent to the Button on campus, broadcasting the screen in the direction of the encampment. Standing just outside the encampment when the video was playing, I heard three protesters clapping and cheering as a video of an Israeli woman getting raped and paraded in the streets of Gaza was displayed. The night before, I spotted a protester wearing a sweater with a Star of David and two rats depicted on the back, which imitates Nazi-style propaganda from the 1930s.\u00a0\n\t\tThe following night, protesters were recorded cheering \u201cAl Qassem make us proud, take another soldier down.\u201d Al Qassem is the military wing of Hamas, the group behind the Oct. 7 rape, mass murder, and abduction of Israeli civilians that has contributed to the deaths of thousands of Israelis and Palestinians since it took control of Gaza in 2007.\u00a0\nLast Tuesday, I walked near the encampment and saw a large PFLP (Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine) flag flying, which is a U.S.-designated terror organization. PFLP has been behind numerous terror attacks against Israeli civilians, including the hijacking in 1976 that diverted a flight leaving Israel to Entebbe, Uganda, and the raid of a Jerusalem synagogue, killing four in 2014. PFLP also opposes all negotiations with Israel and only envisions a Middle East without a Jewish state.\n\t\t\t\tEven worse, Penn\u2019s anonymous social media app, Sidechat, has been filled with an increasing number of pro-Palestinian supporters at Penn speaking out against the encampment, citing the diversion of the encampment from the values of the protest. Instead of protesting for the establishment of a Palestinian state and the end of the war, the encampment has turned this movement into an antisemitic cesspool, where students cannot walk on campus with Judaica items without being harassed by protesters. Even worse, not all members are students. When I attempted to look inside the encampment several days ago, I was approached by two protesters acting as \u201cguards.\u201d They did not name themselves, but they both acknowledged that they were not students, just Philadelphia residents with no association to Penn. Why should people outside of the Penn community have the ability to use Penn property to sleep and harass Jewish students? Why are non-Penn affiliates determining who is and who is not allowed on parts of our campus?\nOn April 29, pro-Palestinian protesters stormed Hamilton Hall at Columbia University, shattering the front windows and taking one security guard hostage. NYPD then forcefully removed the protesters, facing instant backlash. With Columbia's administration being hesitant to clear up the protest, students were able to easily obtain access to the building and vandalize it. As the protests at Penn are continuing to radicalize, the administration must follow through on their promise to clear the encampment before it is too late. Penn could be next.\u00a0\n\tSupporting the encampment and the groups they endorse is preventing any meaningful action and dialogue from occurring at Penn. Instead of speaking to diverse groups of students about their experiences with the conflict, the encampment is choosing to invite individuals outside of the Penn community to come to Penn and harass Jewish students. Instead of inviting leaders of the Jewish community to speak with students on the other side to discuss issues and common ground, the Chabad rabbi is being denied entry into the encampment because he is visibly Jewish. Instead of making Jewish students willing to talk to pro-Palestinian protesters about points of common ground, Jewish students are being harassed with Nazi-era rhetoric and praising of terrorist organizations that want to annihilate Jews from this planet.\nIf we want real action and dialogue to occur on this campus, continuing to support an encampment that has turned into an antisemitic hatefest continuing to harass Jewish students is not the answer. There is room for dialogue, there is room for peaceful protest, and there is room for change. There is a difference between a peaceful protest to endorse a cause, and cheering for terrorist groups that actively call for the elimination of Jewish students. Harassing Jewish students is not the best method to get community members to support your cause. Enough is enough.\nBEN MESSAFI is a College first year studying economics and political science from Westchester, N.Y.

          "title": "Zack Ben-Ezra | The free speech double standard",
          "article_content": "In the past week, much has been written about the Gaza Solidarity Encampment that sprung up on Penn\u2019s campus. Much has missed the point.\u00a0\nLet me be clear and unequivocal before I proceed: I strongly believe in protecting free speech, especially speech I disagree with, but that protection must be applied even handedly and is not without sensible content-neutral limitations.\u00a0\n\t\tFree speech and academic freedom are paramount to a productive university campus. A university should be a place where ideas are freely exchanged, where we encounter new ideas that make us uncomfortable, and where we ultimately grow as a community in the pursuit of some greater truth. Not everyone needs to agree, nor should they, but we must remain respectful and even-handed to ensure that ideas continue to flow, and the marketplace of ideas continues to flourish.\u00a0\nThe Penn community and its leadership has utterly failed to even handedly protect free speech on campus.\u00a0\n\t\t\n\t\nNo one has the right to set up an encampment in violation of university policy \u2014 it doesn\u2019t matter what you are protesting or on which side you are. That is a simple viewpoint-neutral time, place, and manner restriction \u2014 a \u00a0fundamental principle of our free speech jurisprudence.\u00a0\nIn his Apr. 26 university-wide email, Interim Penn President Larry Jameson himself acknowledged that the \u201cencampment itself violates the University\u2019s facilities policies\u201d and that \u201charassing and intimidating comments and actions by some of the protesters, which were reported and documented by many in our community, violate Penn\u2019s open expression guidelines and state and federal law, including Title VI of the Civil Rights Act.\u201d Jameson then ordered the encampment to disband.\n\tThat was more than a week ago, and the encampment remains active on College Green.\nIt truly perplexes me how an Ivy League institution actively being sued under Title VI can simultaneously admit that there are Title VI violations on their campus and then take no action to stop them. This is a true failure by university administration, and they deserve to be held accountable.\u00a0\nImagine a situation in which a pro-police encampment sprouted up on campus in the wake of George Floyd and the Black Lives Matter movement. Imagine that the encampment was the same size as the Gaza Solidarity Encampment and was similarly disruptive to campus life and destructive of campus property. Now ask yourself, would that pro-police encampment be tolerated to the same extent that the current encampment is? I have a hard time believing it and so should you.\u00a0\nDon\u2019t believe me? Look no further than the University\u2019s treatment of its own faculty. Professor Amy Wax is currently being investigated and threatened with sanctions for comments she made about racial and ethnic minorities. Let me be clear: I am not here to defend Wax. Her comments deserve to be investigated, and possibly sanctioned. But ask yourself, is the University\u2019s treatment of Wax being fairly applied to other faculty members? I have witnessed members of Penn faculty call for an intifada as part of on-campus protests and have seen Penn lecturer Dwayne Booth\u2019s cartoons that invoke deeply troubling antisemitic tropes. Where are the university-wide investigations into these faculty members? Where is the discussion on university sanctions against them? They are nowhere to be found.\u00a0\n\t\tGet our newsletter, DP Daybreak, delivered to your inbox every weekday morning.Penn and its leadership must work to genuinely uphold free speech and academic freedom on campus. University policy must be applied fairly and in a viewpoint-neutral manner to all members of the campus community. That means protecting speech when appropriate and restricting speech when in violation of reasonable, viewpoint-neutral policies \u2014 whether we agree or disagree with what is being said.\u00a0\nWe have the privilege of being a part of one of the most prestigious universities in the world. This is a privilege of which many of our grandparents could only dream. This privilege comes with the responsibility to engage in discourse in a fair and even-handed manner. It\u2019s about time we start living up to this privilege, and it\u2019s about time Penn\u2019s leadership and faculty started acting as role models in leading the way.\u00a0\nZACK BEN-EZRA is a second-year J.D. student at Penn Carey Law School.

          "article_content": "Guest columnist Rebecca Stein responds to Tulia Falleti's editorial addressing the billboard trucks on campus.Dear Tulia,\nIt saddens me that you chose the return of the billboards as the focus of your concern related to the encampment on College Green. You state that they are part of an external, political campaign against higher education, but I see them as a comfort that I am not alone here at Penn.\n\t\tSince the encampment has gone up, I spend every lunch break in counterprotest. I have my lunch outside the library where I work, with my Bring Them Home Now T-shirt and an Israeli flag. I am there to show Jewish students that they are not alone and to remind the community that the history of the Jewish people is complex, that words matter, and that shouting slogans does not move us to a peaceful resolution; neither at Penn, nor in the Middle East.\nYou write that the students participating in the encampment are \u201cbrilliant and caring.\u201d But I beg to differ: If they were caring, they would not shout \u201cintifada revolution.\u201d They would ask me about my personal experience during the intifada and about my friend\u2019s father, who spent his last 15 years as a quadriplegic after a suicide attack carried out during the first intifada.\n\t\t\n\t\nThe student that held up a sign reading \u201cZionism is racism\u201d is not brilliant. Judaism is both a faith and a nationhood. But it is not a race. There are plenty of Jews of every race living in Israel. These brilliant students would do better listening more and shouting less.\nAnd finally, you write that \u201cwe are a city of Brotherly Love.\u201d But this too seems off. A mother asked me, \u201cWhy are you standing here all alone? There are a thousand Jewish students on campus. Why are they not standing with you?\u201d I asked her why only the Jewish students are required to stand up for the hostages and for the right of Jews for nationhood. In a city of brotherly love, you should all be out there in support of your Jewish and Israeli students, faculty, and staff members when they feel so alone.\n\tStop by and listen; stop by and talk.\nREBECCA STEIN is the co-executive director of the Center for Excellence in Teaching, Learning and Innovation.

          "title": "Faresi Alfaresi | Stop invoking the \u2018violent, raging, Arab\u2019 stereotype",
          "article_content": "I am an international student from Kuwait \u2014 but many assume that I am American upon first meeting me. I have an American accent, tattoos, piercings, and no particular explicit indication of my identity as an Arab man; I do not wear a necklace in Arabic, and I have never worn Arab cultural attire around campus. So, why is it that I constantly have an opinion thrust upon me regarding campus protests and Israel-Palestine as a whole?\nPlease do not misunderstand me as selfishly complaining or not wanting to engage in political discourse. I bring this to light to convey that even I, as relatively non-Arab presenting as I am, have not been spared the Penn community\u2019s blatant and upsetting racial profiling. I have lost count of how many individuals \u2014 ranging from peers to distant acquaintances to strangers \u2014 that I have met who assumed my position on the Israel-Palestine conflict or that I was even Muslim since the escalation on Oct. 7.\n\t\tOf course, it is arguably normal for an individual to make harmless assumptions based on observations. But the issue arises when these assumptions, as often occurs at Penn, become the basis for stereotypical and hateful rhetoric. I study Hebrew at Penn, and other students have always asked me if I feel \u201cangry\u201d or \u201cupset\u201d in class when a discussion centering around Israel or Zionism arises. And therein lies one of the issues: Arab students such as myself are not asked for their positions nor given the benefit of the doubt. We are immediately thrust into a position of aggressive anger and discontent that we never even communicated nor chose ourselves. The notion of the \u2018angry Arab\u2019 is rooted in imperial and colonialist mindsets, and perhaps more salient is the distortion of Arab students\u2019 words and intentions \u2014 a concept reminiscent of the West\u2019s initial misconstruing of Edward Said\u2019s writings.\u00a0\nI have also found minuscule and dwindling support from the Hebrew department during my studies, with my only alternative to finishing my major requirement \u2014 besides a language class that cannot fit my schedule \u2014 being a class revolving around Israeli culture. I cannot help but think of the Penn community's outrage had I been a white and/or Jewish student not being supported in their Arabic studies and forced to take a class around Palestinian culture. To be crystal clear, I would not condone the aforementioned happening to any Jewish student, nor do I condone the alleged forceful attendance of Jewish students to the Palestine Writes Literature Festival for their class. A university as well endowed and progressive as Penn can and should provide ample support and resources to both communities; it would be a grave injustice otherwise. But whilst Jewish students who express their fears garnered earned and necessary support from the University, and even testified at Congress, here I am explicitly expressing my concerns for the safety of myself and other Arab students in another column due to the shameful lack of support.\u00a0\n\t\t\t\tSEE MORE FROM \ufeffFARESI ALFARESI:Penn must not succumb to post-9/11 hysterics and anti-Arab rhetoricDespite all of these concerns, including the ones voiced in my previous column and the data from the survey I have collected, Penn fails to shed light on the concerns and fears of the Arab community. The Jewish community had the antisemitism task force established as far back as November, and the Arab community received the scraps of a generalized \u201ccommission against hate\u201d; I implore us all, regardless of political views and association, to ask why antisemitism is allowed to have the word \u201ctask force\u201d attached to it while anti-Arab hate and Islamophobia does not get the same explicit word? Is this not a clear inequality on the administration\u2019s end? And it is not a matter of semantics, as the explicitness of the antisemitism task force conveys its \u2014 rightful and valid \u2014 importance whilst the generalized \u201ccommission against hate\u201d fails to even include the word \u201cArab\u201d and/or \u201cMuslim\u201d in it, let alone convey the same sense of urgency and action.\u00a0\nThe lack of equal task force establishment, both in speed of establishment and in title, is not the only thing that further divides the struggling communities at Penn. The absolute disregard that interim President Larry Jameson and the Penn administration had for Ramadan and Eid is appalling and indescribably discriminatory; not acknowledging these major religious holidays for a community that is already underrepresented and discriminated against during these trying times communicates one thing: that Arab and Muslim students do not matter.\n\tThis is only exemplified by the fact that less than a week after Eid, an email was sent out that mentioned Passover and the safety of Jewish students in light of encampments. This does not help support or heal the Jewish nor Arab students but rather continues to widen the chasm that our previous president left behind. Are Arab and Muslim students not equally worthy of safety from potential collateral damage caused by protesting? Are Arab and Muslim holidays not worthy of any mention at all? In fact, just as early as May 1, students suffered a chemical attack while security waited before intervention, and the administration has not acknowledged this matter with the urgency the encampment was addressed with. Comments circulated on The Daily Pennsylvanian\u2019s Instagram coverage mocking the individuals and trivializing the attack by claiming the agent was \u201cfart spray,\u201d and a counter-protestor was caught with two knives and walked off with only a citation.\u00a0\nEven more vitriolic and direct hate-speech that weaponizes the \u2018terrorist\u2019 rhetoric was espoused by alleged Penn community members towards Arab students on May 5; protestors at the encampment were awoken with a mocking of the Muslim call to prayer and were directly called \u201cterrorists,\u201d a blatant Islamophobic and anti-Arab notion that harms community members not involved in the encampment and protests. None of the aforementioned has been addressed by Jameson in his volley of emails, further proving Penn\u2019s lack of support for Muslim and Arab students. Again, I cannot help but think of the Penn community's outrage had this happened to any of the pro-Israel counter-protestors who were also exercising their First Amendment rights.\nI have heard the concerns and fears of my Jewish peers, and I am hurt by the thought that students within the mainstream Jewish community have to feel fearful no matter the reason or tangible validity of it. I have attended different seders over Passover, I have co-hosted dialogues to foster understanding, and I will continue to do so and grow my understanding and empathy. But I have mostly been asked if my friends and I \u2014 as Arab individuals\u00a0\u2014\u00a0fear daily life on campus by Arab professors and by friends abroad, rarely by other groups of individuals. So, as a closing note, I beseech all readers to check in on and comfort your Arab peers \u2014 and when their fears and sorrow transform into anger and action, consider all that they have endured and the absolute lack of support before labeling their anger and emotionality as \u2018irrational, \u2018scary,\u2019 and \u2018violent.\u2019\nFARESI ALFARESI is a College junior studying political science and modern Middle Eastern studies from Kuwait.

          "article_content": "We write as faculty members seeking to sound an alarm. We urge Penn administrators and the Board of Trustees not to use police force against on-campus protesters. Real, good-faith negotiation is the path forward. First, because it is more likely to restore calm on our campus. Second, because our University, rightly, has already committed itself to upholding the principle of free expression.\nWe have had the privilege of working with many colleagues in attempts to strengthen that commitment to open expression. Such attempts go back decades. They should not be abandoned now.\n\t\tIndeed, the University has agreed-upon procedures already in place. We have a long-standing Committee on Open Expression. This committee is advisory to the administration. It is charged with interpreting the University\u2019s Guidelines on Open Expression. We value both the Guidelines and the Committee\u2019s role. Both should be reviewed in times of calm \u2014 and honored in times of upheaval. They represent a foundation for the airing of a full range of content on campus and for finding ways to resolve conflicts when they arise. Now is exactly the kind of moment they were written for.\nIn a moment of real crisis, such as we face now, the Guidelines are indispensable because they focus on principles rather than content. A measure of this crucial significance is conveyed by the following assertion in the very Guidelines: \u201cIn case of a conflict between the principles of the Guidelines on Open Expression and other University policies, the Principles of the Guidelines shall take precedence.\u201d\u00a0This statement, taken seriously, opens the door for ongoing dialogue rather than punitive solutions in cases such as that of this encampment.\n\t\t\n\t\nSome on our campus seek to use the Guidelines to undermine rather than support peaceful demonstrators. We argue against any attempt to manipulate the Guidelines in that way.\nWe urge everyone in our community to read them. These Guidelines were written for you.\n\tThe Guidelines must not be a means by which the University pursues the wholesale denial of rights of open expression for an entire group of peaceful protesters. There are mechanisms in place to address the actions of individuals who violate the guidelines. Any such actions should be investigated, with due process being paramount. We are particularly concerned about decisions to issue letters of referral to the Center for Community Standards and Accountability. \u00a0\u00a0\nWe urge interim President Larry Jameson and Provost John L.

          "title": "Olivia Haynie, Jack Starobin, Evie Klein | Three Jewish students say: stop attacking our professors",
          "article_content": "On March 28, 149 Penn alumni and current students sent a letter calling for the punishment of eight Penn professors to Interim Penn President Larry Jameson. The letter accuses these professors of involvement in \u201cpro-terrorism events,\u201d having \u201cdiscriminated against students \u2026 for being Jewish, Israeli, or Zionist,\u201d \u00a0negligence in their duties as teachers, and hindering \u201cthe right to freedom of thought and expression by Jewish students.\u201d Nowhere in this letter do the authors provide examples that back up these claims. Many of these authors do not even know the professors of whom they speak. We are alarmed that so many alumni would sign onto a statement rooted in rumor, hearsay, and conspiracy.\nUnlike many of the letter's signatories, we are Jewish students who know these professors. We have sat in their classrooms, read their work, and, in some cases, cried on their shoulders. We are writing in defense of our professors who are being slandered and used as political pawns in the ongoing attack on academic freedom and free speech. We stand by all eight professors. We are writing on only three of them at length because these are the three we know best.\n\t\tSince my first day in her class \u201cMedia and Culture in Contemporary Iran\u201d last semester, Shams made me feel welcome and supported. When it came up in conversation that I was Jewish, she was very excited to tell me that we had a full day of the course dedicated to learning about the history of Jews in Iran. Our readings for that class were rich and incredibly powerful. We learned about Jews who escaped Poland and found safe haven in Tehran, Iran, during World War II. In class, we watched videos about the experiences of these Jews as well as the Jews who live in Iran today. To censure Shams and her classes would result in Penn losing the only class at this school that has provided me with the chance to learn about this important Jewish history.\nNot only did Shams not discriminate against me for being Jewish, she encouraged me to share my experiences as a Jew in her class and allowed me to feel empowered citing my Jewish identity. Where the accusations that she impedes Jewish students\u2019 freedom of expression in the classroom came from, I have no idea \u2014 especially since the signatories of the letter did not bother citing this claim. From my time in her classroom \u2014 time virtually none of the signatories had \u2014 I saw no proof of this practice and, in fact, saw proof of the opposite.\n\t\t\n\t\nShams was the only professor to reach out to me personally to see how I was doing after the events of Oct. 7, 2023. On Oct. 10, 2023, she wrote to me that she was thinking of me. She offered to even meet with me in person if I needed someone to talk to and that her prayers were with me and everyone else affected by the violence that had broken out. She recognized my Jewishness and the vulnerable state my community and I were in.\u00a0\nIn several of the pieces of \u201cevidence\u201d of Shams\u2019 Jew-hatred that the signatories provide, they engage in logical fallacies. For example, the letter criticizes Shams\u2019 tweet supporting a walkout for Palestine in October 2023. The signatories point out that protesters were ripping down posters, as if this is a relevant point, when nowhere in the tweet does Shams encourage, defend, or even mention posters being ripped down. There is also no evidence she was involved or even aware this behavior was taking place. They accuse her of saying \u201c\u2018Israelites\u2019 deserved the attack they received on October 7\u201d without providing any evidence of this taking place.\n\tShams is one of the most compassionate and empathetic professors I have ever had while at Penn. Shame on anyone who says she does not care about Jewish students, and shame on anyone who dares to accuse her of supporting terrorism. Even more shame on those who would do so with no evidence. To slander a person knowing you have no reasons for your vitriol means that the only place the lies come from is one of hatred. This is not about supporting Jewish students: It is about silencing faculty who are pro-Palestinian, even if it is through immoral means. Now more than ever Penn cannot afford to lose brilliant minds like Shams and voices dedicated to justice and peace. Now more than ever, Penn cannot give in to bullies like the signatories of this letter who seek to limit free speech and academic freedom on our campus.\nI am a Jewish Penn student in Norton's \"Language and Politics\" class. When I read the recent alumni letter accusing Norton of antisemitism, I was baffled. The letter alleges that Norton has engaged in \"disrespectful and dismissive treatment of Jewish students and the Jewish community.\" This description could not be further from the truth.\nLet me begin with the most obvious counterexample to the letter's allegation. Norton has supported me in studying Jewish history. One of my assignments for her class required me to select and analyze a word that has \"traveled\" languages. I selected the word \"ghetto,\" in part for its resonance with my Jewish heritage. As we discussed in class, the word \"ghetto\" first appeared in reference to the segregated Jewish quarter of Venice, Italy, in 1516. Jewish immigrants brought the word to the United States. The Nazis also used the word in their orchestration of the Holocaust.\nNorton not only respected my choice to study this word but also helped me deepen my analysis of it. She posed illuminating questions about the evolution of the word's cultural significance in English, and she treated the entire discussion with the seriousness that the word \"ghetto\" deserves. As a Jewish student, I felt neither unusually conspicuous nor overlooked at any point in her class. I felt free to pursue my interests in community with my professor and my classmates.\nIn the middle of the semester, when a Jewish community group with which I'm involved hosted an event on campus, Norton gave nothing but support to me and my peers. She asked me how she could help us secure an event space, and she has continued to take a supportive interest in my Jewish community group's wellbeing.\nMoreover, my class discussions with Norton have been some of the most engaging I've had at Penn. Norton draws on a remarkable breadth of texts and historical contexts to illuminate our readings each week. I am astounded that anyone would suggest, as does the recent alumni letter, that she exhibits a \"reckless disregard for scholarly and professional norms.\" There has not been a classroom on this campus where I have felt safer, freer, or more excited to ask questions than hers.\nThe people who make me feel unsafe on this campus are those who seek to forcibly silence me and my peers for criticizing Israel. In the past year, I have received hate mail from strangers vowing to \"pay my way to Gaza\" \u2014 presumably to send me to my death for decrying Israeli apartheid. Strangers have called me a \"kapo,\" a \"race-traitor,\" and a \"self-hating Jew\" in response to my critical stance towards the Israeli government's perpetration of genocide in Gaza. MAGA members of Congress like Rep. Elise Stefanik (R-N.Y.) have invoked the notion of Jewish safety in service of a far-right political movement that explicitly welcomes neo-Nazi ideologues and attacks free speech on college campuses like Penn's.\nThese are the people who have \"hindered the right to freedom of thought and expression by Jewish students\" at Penn, to excerpt one of the allegations made in the alumni letter. Threats to our safety come from far-right politicians, strangers online, and a University administration that routinely caves to political pressure at the expense of academic freedom. Not Norton. Norton has modeled integrity in her commitment to the human dignity of Palestinian people, and she exemplifies rigor in her comportment in class.\nIf the authors of the alumni letter care about antisemitism, they should target real antisemites. They should stand against genocide and apartheid. They have nothing to condemn in Norton. If, as they say, they want to stand for a university that gives \"equitable due respect\" to all students, they have everything to learn from her example.\nI met Dwayne \u201cMr. Fish\u201d Booth my first year from the suggestion of a Student Health and Counseling therapist to find someone on campus interested in humor. During our first conversation, he took complete interest in my work and goals as a student, an appreciation he shows to all who step into his classroom. My sophomore year, I took both of his classes, \u201cSick and Satired\u201d in the fall and \u201cWARNING! Graphic Content\u201d in the spring. Among his pupils, Mr. Fish is known for his irreverent sense of humor, eccentric lectures, and ability to foster in-class dialogue. Questioning the material is encouraged, and I constantly use this right to tell Mr. Fish he\u2019s wrong without repercussions.\u00a0\nThe rich tradition of Jewish humor also plays a major role in Mr. Fish\u2019s curriculum. Dating as far back as examples in Talmudic midrash, Jewish humor has served as a tool for Jews to question for over a millennium. Mr. Fish teaches about great, 20th-century Jewish comedians like Mort Saul and Lenny Bruce, who used their humor not simply to entertain, but challenge authority. Mr. Fish has always encouraged me to celebrate this tradition, helping me feel spiritual value in carrying on this practice of my ancestors.\u00a0\nThis semester, I\u2019ve had the opportunity to work with Mr. Fish in an independent study focusing on developing my skills as a writer and humorist. Assignments range from hourlong jazz listening sessions to writing exercises encouraging me to eavesdrop around campus. In between reviewing edits and discussing weekly readings, he always takes the time to ask about my personal life with genuine care. If I forget to disclose a detail about my dating history or family drama in person, he\u2019ll eventually find out through an essay.\u00a0\nIn exchange, he keeps me updated on his own state of affairs. During a meeting in February, he told me about a far-right reporter who wrote a hit piece on his cartoons. As I left his office I said, \u201cIf anyone gives you trouble, tell them 100% of one of your classes is Jewish.\u201d That Sunday, Jameson released his statement condemning Mr. Fish\u2019s cartoons as antisemitic.\u00a0\nI want to acknowledge the pain felt by members of my Jewish community from interpretations of Mr. Fish\u2019s cartoons. The provocative nature of political cartooning leaves room for multiple interpretations, even those unintended by the author. However, I am horrified that my professor\u2019s ability to criticize Israeli occupation and violence is being threatened. The most unsafe I\u2019ve ever felt on campus as a Jew came following a slew of death threats against Mr. Fish. We were forced to temporarily stop meeting in person out of safety concerns. My ability to even debate my professor on his work was put in peril by actions allegedly meant to protect me. \u00a0\nTo see the University and alumni who have no insight into his character censor Mr. Fish dictates a worrying trend. There is nothing more Jewish than creating space for debate, and Mr. Fish\u2019s classroom is one of the few places on campus where this right is fully protected.\u00a0\nThe authors appear to have written this letter not out of concern for the safety of Jewish students, but as a way to bully pro-Palestinian voices with whom the signatories disagree. If this letter's signatories really cared about Jewish students, they would not add to the tension and unease that has already taken over this campus. We hope the administration takes our words and experiences into consideration.\n\t\tGet our newsletter, DP Daybreak, delivered to your inbox every weekday morning.OLIVIA HAYNIE is a College senior studying sociology from Durham, N.C.

          "title": "Natalie Minkovsky | Student protests at Penn",
          "article_content": "As a Penn parent, I received an email on Apr. 26 signed by Interim Penn President Larry Jameson, Provost John L. Jackson Jr., and Senior Executive Vice President Craig R. Carnaroli. The email claimed \u201clegal and policy violations'' by the Penn encampment protesters based on vague allegations of \"harassing and intimidating conduct\" and threatened the students who will continue to protest with \"sanctions.\" No specific examples of harassment, threats, or intimidation were offered in the letter, which appears to be an attempt to demonize the students who exercise their right to free speech enshrined in the United States Constitution and express views inconvenient to Penn's administration.\nI am also very disappointed that the letter did not discuss any of the protesters\u2019 demands nor any attempts by the University leadership to engage with the protesters and discuss these demands. Moreover, the administration did not even mention the \u201celephant in the room\u201d \u2014 the ongoing genocide in Gaza, which prompted our children to occupy College Green. The allegations of genocide were well-documented by the South African charge to the International Court of Justice and ruled to be credible by the Court in January of this year. The daily genocidal attacks on the Palestinian people are evident from reports, photography, and videos published on social media.\u00a0\n\t\tThe complicity of the current U.S. administration in supplying bombs and ammunition \u2014 facilitating the mass murder of more than 30,000 Palestinian civilians, the majority of whom are women and children \u2014 is likewise evident. Moreover, our well-educated and critically-thinking children see the close connection between Penn, which named its Center for Diplomacy and Global Engagement after the current U.S. president, and the Biden administration, which sent former Penn President Amy Gutmann to serve as the U.S. ambassador to Germany.\u00a0\nOur students, currently gathered on College Green, are the best and brightest of the University. What they have to offer to humanity is morality and empathy. They are deeply disturbed by the atrocities committed in our name and want straight answers about Penn\u2019s connection to the military-industrial complex profiting from the current carnage. They demand divestment from the regime, which for dozens of years occupied and oppressed the Palestinian people, and now is engaged in their wholesale slaughter. Our students adorned a campus statue of American revolutionary Benjamin Franklin with the Palestinian flag and keffiyeh, symbols of resistance. I believe he would be proud of this nonviolent protest.\n\t\t\n\t\nStudents protesting injustice on college campuses is not a new and unique phenomenon. Moreover, these acts of resistance proved to be successful on many occasions. 50 years ago, anti-Vietnam War protests contributed to stopping the bloody conflict, which claimed the lives of 58,000 Americans and more than 2 million Vietnamese. 40 years ago, the Boycott, Divestment, and Sanctions (BDS) movement made the brutal South African apartheid regime one of the past. More recently, the BDS campaign designed to pressure the Zionist regime \u2014 which, according to the UN Special Rapporteur and several human rights organizations, including the esteemed Amnesty International, created a \u201ccruel system of domination and crime against humanity\u201d \u2014 to grant full rights to Arab Palestinians resulted in divestment and academic boycotts by dozens of American and Canadian universities.\nGiven its place as one of America's premier academic institutions, Penn is expected to hold itself to a higher level of discourse. Instead, it has chosen to bend to external pressure and cast its students as pariahs.\n\tThe scenes of police violence perpetrated on peaceful student protesters at Columbia University, the University of Texas at Austin, and the University of Southern California by intellectually shallow and irresponsible administrators at those institutions made me, a parent, extremely worried. As a concerned Penn parent, I urge the Penn administration to engage in an open and transparent dialogue with the protesters while ensuring the safety and security of everyone involved. What the students are doing is not an isolated incident of disruption \u2014 it is an act of moral conviction and solidarity. It is a part of a national and worldwide movement to achieve peace and justice for the Palestinian people and stop the genocide perpetrated against them by the Israeli war machine armed, funded, and supported by the Biden administration.\nNATALIE MINKOVSKY is a former biomedical researcher at the Perelman School of Medicine.

          "title": "Eashwar Kantemneni | Keeping an open mind",
          "article_content": "I have been a die-hard sports fan for as long as I can remember. Growing up, I was glued to my TV as I watched the Cavs and Warriors battle back-and-forth for four years straight in the NBA Finals, the Buckeyes destroyed that team up north every November for eight years straight (that will resume this fall), and my Bengals sadly following-up promising regular seasons with devastating playoff losses (thankfully that has changed). I would spend countless hours sharpening my sports knowledge and opinions through watching \"First Take\" and \"Undisputed,\" or reading practically every article on ESPN.\nDespite my strong following of sports and sports media, though, I never once saw myself in journalism, even as a hobby. My high school had a well-established newspaper with a sports section. Yet, I never once had the interest to write an article during my four years. I never really enjoyed writing in general, so I thought to myself, \u201cWhy would I spend my free time doing that?\u201d\n\t\tIn my first semester at Penn, I attended the virtual club fair and came across The Daily Pennsylvanian\u2019s Only Section That Matters (DPOSTM). I had learned about and admired the DP\u2019s importance at Penn before I even started college. While journalism still was not my interest, I thought I would keep an open mind and joined DPOSTM thinking it would at least be a good way to make some new friends with similar interests and limit my boredom from COVID-19 lockdowns. I still remember spending a whole day going through the online archives for individual game recaps for my first-ever story on Penn\u2019s 2012 football Ivy Title and the excitement I got after seeing it published online. Still, my first year at DPOSTM was relatively uneventful. I struggled to consistently write stories while balancing a loaded schedule of pre-med requirements. I never thought that the DP would soon after turn out to become an integral part of my Penn experience.\nAfter not being involved during the summer, I got an email right before the school year about becoming an associate editor. I filled out the form not expecting to get picked, as many of the clubs I had applied to at Penn ended in rejection before. However, when I got the email saying I was accepted, I was pleasantly surprised and eager to start. During my first associate shift, I felt uneasy not having met anyone from DPOSTM in person yet. Once I entered the office, though, I felt relaxed and in awe seeing all the old newspapers and posters tacked on the wall, thinking I could leave something of my own there one day. Though I had just met Brandon, Lochlahn, Joey, and Nicky, I quickly felt I was a part of their and the larger DPOSTM community. We would spend shifts talking about our NFL teams or watching random basketball games on the monitors. Their love for sports writing quickly spread to me, and I went from having written about six stories up until then to matching that total in just one week. Moreover, I began to get involved with DPOSTM outside of Wednesday shifts by attending the weekly meetings and going on road trips to cover Penn football games at Columbia and Harvard University.\n\t\t\t\tSEE MORE FROM \ufeffEASHWAR KANTEMNENI:Men's Rookie of the Year: Malachi HosleyPenn men's basketball loses fourth straight conference game in 70-61 loss to Brown?\nThat semester motivated me to eventually run for and become an editor in 2022. Initially, the responsibilities felt daunting. The long shifts on Sunday afternoons and Tuesday and Wednesday nights sounded annoying, but those concerns quickly washed away. Working with Matt to help lead the department was a great experience. He seemed like he was somehow always in control of the operation, and I did my best to help out in any way I could. Being in the office consistently allowed me to get to know and have fun conversations with people around the DP: like Caleb, Sophie, Allyson, Anna, Jonah, Asaad, Derek, and many more. Soon, they all began showing up for our weekly sports meetings and BYOs, and we ended our term with DPOSTM more integrated into the DP than ever before. The sports office also became the hub which I based my schedule around, and the editing shifts and weekly meetings became some of the highlights of my week. I even put in a few extra hours to perfect some PIG shots before we played every Sunday shift.\n\t?\nWhat I will undoubtedly remember most about DPOSTM though are covering games and the road trips we took. A few of my favorites include Matt and I convincing AComm (Penn Athletic Communications) to give us press passes to cover the March Madness games that Penn was hosting at the 76ers stadium; Brandon driving us eight hours up to Dartmouth (with a convenient excursion to explore the Connecticut State Capitol on the way) to cover Penn football\u2019s massive upset victory over the Big Green (which I predicted in the car ride there), and staying at a scary-looking farm in northern New Hampshire, only for it to be one of the most beautiful nature scenes in the morning; subbing in as an on-field photographer for Penn football\u2019s last-second comeback victory over Princeton; and driving through New York City for the first time in a thunderstorm on the way to Yale. Traveling all around the Northeast and the fun experiences I had with the people that I did not have space to mention are some of my best experiences at Penn, and I will always remember them.\n\nHad you told me before I started college that joining a student newspaper would be my biggest extracurricular activity, I would never have believed it. But after these last four years, I am thankful and proud that that is the case. As I move forward with life, I will always make sure that I keep an open mind when trying new things, with the hopes it will end up a similarly great experience like DPOSTM. \u00a0\u00a0\nEASHWAR KANTEMNENI is a College senior studying neuroscience from Cincinnati.

          "title": "Walden Green | It\u2019s about the cones",
          "article_content": "I have loved spending my past three years as a part of The Daily Pennsylvanian more than words can properly capture. It has almost destroyed me more than once.\nThe DP has given me multiple panic attacks and lost me full nights of sleep. I\u2019m probably still recovering from the temporary insanity of spending countless hours in that windowless office at 40th and Walnut streets. And the thing is, for someone who\u2019s served two consecutive years on the company\u2019s executive board, all of this is par for the course.\n\t\tWe\u2019re a real newsroom, and newsrooms are really stressful places. The difference is that our little media company is built on college students \u2014 still kids, in many ways \u2014 managing other college students.\u00a0\nIf you\u2019re anything like me, you have a love-hate relationship with the DP\u2019s ceaseless, internal politicking and gossip. Some days, it has made me feel like Machiavelli, and on others, like I need to pull a \u201cMy Year of Rest and Relaxation.\u201d Whether exhausting (often) or exhilarating (rarely), DP drama is never not a massive time suck. Every year, like clockwork, comes the inevitable board memo about how we all need to do less of it; anyone who can solve that will be the greatest editor in our 140-year history.\n\t\t\n\t\nBut let\u2019s take it as a given that it can\u2019t be solved, and why would we want to anyway? My culturally Jewish heritage has given me an appreciation for the sacred art of the kvetch, the vent, complaining for complaining\u2019s sake. It\u2019s what lets us blow off steam and then get back to doing our jobs.\u00a0\nNominally, those jobs are \u201ceditor\u201d or \u201cmanager,\u201d but when you break it down, they\u2019re all the same thing: teacher, mentor, sensei, mafia boss. If our staffers don\u2019t know how to do their jobs, there\u2019s no way for us to do ours, and hopefully, if we teach at least one well enough, they will eventually be able to destroy us and assume our place.\u00a0\n\tAt this year\u2019s annual DP Banquet, I gave a toast to our 139th board president, Jesse Zhang, where I said something to the effect of \u201cevery board position is a service position, and the higher up on the org chart you go, the truer that is.\u201d Yet, some of the best teachers I knew during my time as a 34th Street writer \u2014 Denali Sagner or Kyle Whiting or Aakruti Ganeshan \u2014 were the ones who never ran for Street\u2019s executive board at all. They never let the climb get in the way of the work.\u00a0\nThe drama gets especially bad around elections season every November. Hushed conversations happen behind locked doors; friendships either begin to crack or implode all at once; the committee schemes while the hopefuls endlessly speculate. Remember, all these kids got into an Ivy League school. It\u2019s easy to believe that the board position you do or don\u2019t get will determine the rest of your life, or at least your time in college. It won\u2019t. But I\u2019ve been guilty of this line of thought myself, and I\u2019m grateful I never had to learn the lesson the hard way. I can admit that much.\nIn a way, I have the most respect for the people who were on board as sophomores and didn\u2019t run a second time; who got in, did what they were there to do, and got out. I think of someone like Hannah Gross, the 137th board assignments editor, whose path only crossed with mine a couple of times. We met once when she was back in the office, doing interviews for a story she was writing about the company culture. She didn\u2019t seem burned out, or like she was missing out on something. She looked happy.\nAllow me to clarify: I do not regret a single moment I spent at the DP. Without the scheming, I\u2019d be at least a few friends shorter (y\u2019all know who you are) and without the panic attacks, there would be no glossy mag to speak of today. I cherish every single person who has taught me so much \u2014 Bea, Emily, Arielle, Christine, and Katherine \u2014 and the, dare I say, prot\u00e9g\u00e9s I\u2019ve seen come up under my wing \u2014 Natalia, Norah, Sophia, Hannah, Catherine, Kate, the list goes on. I\u2019m honored to have played even the smallest part in their growth as writers and, now, as teachers themselves.\nAs Street editor-in-chief, I made my name and brand on an encyclopedic knowledge of pop culture references. So before I depart this mortal coil for good, how about one more for the road. In the sixth season of the NBC sitcom \u201cParks and Recreation,\u201d my lookalike Ben Wyatt gets laid off from his job and has no idea what to do with himself. Hmm, I wonder what that must be like.\nHe invents an absurdly complicated board game called The Cones of Dunshire: \u201c8-12 players, two wizards, a maverick, the arbiter, two warriors, a corporal, and a ledgerman.\u201d Sounds roughly like the DP company structure to me. As a former competitive Magic: The Gathering player and part-time Dungeons & Dragons aficionado, this is pretty much my love language.\nTwo seasons later, the Cones come back. Ben plays against the executives of made-up tech company Gryzzl to fight for free WiFi in his town of Pawnee, Ind. Just as it seems he\u2019s on the precipice of defeat (\u201clooks like someone\u2019s out of resource gems\u201d), Ben grins, then has a knowing chuckle: \u201cYou made one crucial mistake: you forgot about the essence of the game.

          "title": "Julia Fischer | Fact-check: \u2018Curiosity killed the cat\u2019",
          "article_content": "When I say that I\u2019m a double major and double minor, it sounds like a carefully planned achievement. But what truly brings me joy is not the accomplishment that\u2019ll go on my transcript. It\u2019s what I explain after listing my areas of study: that they came about because I went where curiosity led me.\nStarting college during the COVID-19 pandemic, the most concrete part of my experience was the academics. During those first two semesters, half of my classes were made up of the Integrated Studies Program, a requirement for Benjamin Franklin Scholars in the College of Arts and Sciences. What this really meant was that in the fall, we dissected Homer\u2019s \u201cIliad\u201d in classical studies while reading Erasmus in history. The next semester, we learned about behavior in positive psychology while attempting Jain vegetarianism as part of religious studies. More than specific topics, however, what BFS really taught me is that when it comes to separate disciplines, overlap \u2014 integration \u2014 matters more than difference.\n\t\tFrom there, the rest is history. My time in BFS cemented my decision to major in both Hispanic studies and political science. Post-ISP, I was required to take three BFS seminars. After my first, on Shakespeare, I fell in love with English and decided to complete the minor. And when I stumbled upon global medieval studies at the end of my junior year, I quickly added that minor, too.\nNone of these important academic choices were particularly strategic. I didn\u2019t take on any of my majors and minors because I thought they\u2019d look great on my transcript or help me professionally, but they\u2019ve taught me so much. They represent what college is really about: exploration. Throughout my Penn experience, my main goal has been to learn but never to force myself to be interested in areas I didn\u2019t feel genuinely curious about \u2014 at least, not beyond giving them the \u201cold college try.\u201d\u00a0\n\t\t\n\t\nTo any and all undergraduates reading, please delve into the interests you didn\u2019t have the opportunity to pursue in high school \u2014 and even if you\u2019re an upperclassman, the ones that you feel are being sparked now. Allow curiosity, not just perceived usefulness or resume bling, to dictate how you spend your time. Let it lead you both within and beyond the classroom. Spend six-plus hours per week in Charles Addams Fine Arts Hall for a drawing class. Visit Van Pelt Library and borrow more books, across genres, than you can hope to finish in an academic year. Attend talks, performances, concerts, and movies both on and off campus. Walk around inside of museums and outside in Philadelphia. And apply to work for the student newspaper \u2014 especially if, like I did, you have no prior experience.\nAs anyone who works for The Daily Pennsylvanian knows, curiosity is central to journalism. As a writer for 34th Street this year, it inspired me to cover an array of topics, from niche musical genres to public libraries. For the copy department, curiosity is uniquely crucial. In the Red Room \u2014 copy\u2019s headquarters \u2014 curiosity is expanded and focused on every single detail. A copy editor\u2019s job isn\u2019t just about fixing grammar, spelling, and style; it\u2019s also about fact-checking every statement an article makes. Often, it means dozens of open tabs, and a seven-year-old laptop\u2019s fans running louder than a jet engine (fact-checked, yes, this might be an exaggeration).\n\tCopy-editing can be exhausting. But more often, it\u2019s exhilarating. Nowhere else can I say that I\u2019ve worked on a basketball recap one minute and breaking news the next. I\u2019ve learned so much about campus happenings and culture thanks to copy. And it\u2019s also fundamentally important to publications like the DP. Professionalism, integrity, and the trust of readers rely as much on those behind the scenes as those listed in bylines. In a world where it\u2019s easier than ever to encounter misinformation, copy-editing is a service to truth-telling that\u2019s more essential than ever. And I\u2019m so proud to have been a part of it.\nTo those reading, stay informed. The fact that you\u2019re reading the DP is a great sign. Thank you for supporting student journalism. But don\u2019t allow yourself to be limited in your sources. Never be satisfied with a headline or with a single article. Click on the links your news outlets cite and venture beyond them. Fact-check where you\u2019re doubtful, and even where you\u2019re not. Read across the political spectrum. Question your own assumptions, and those any writer or editor might make \u2014 for all our hard work, journalists are still human.\nAs I wrap up, I\u2019m reminded of the many people I\u2019m grateful for. Like any good editor, I\u2019ll keep it concise. Thank you to Brittany and Sophie, my predecessors, for all your dedication and encouragement. Thank you to Allyson, for being the best co-copy editor and fellow Philadelphia sports fan. Thank you to everyone who made the Red Room warm, filled with laughter and inside jokes. And thank you to my friends and family who read everything I write and listen anytime I say a sentence \u201csounds weird.\u201d Your support means far more than I can keep within 1,000 words.\nSoon, the DP sticker on my laptop will signify my role as an alumna, not a staffer. But I\u2019ll hold on to what the DP and Penn have taught me. I\u2019ll continue to verify the truth where I can. I\u2019ll watch YouTube video essays and go down Wikipedia rabbit holes, collect fun facts and be curious about the places and people around me. And although I\u2019ll depart from my regular schedule of copy shifts, I\u2019ll keep the memories and friendships I\u2019ve made. \u00a0At the end of these four years, I guess there\u2019s one last thing to say.

          "title": "Jesse Zhang | Cheers to never having it 'normal'",
          "article_content": "I remember the day I was admitted to Penn like it was yesterday (off the waitlist, I might add). I was home in China due to the COVID-19 pandemic, and it was four days before my high school graduation on Zoom. I breathed a sigh of relief as the sense of certainty settled in: I was finally going to have a normal college experience.But who was I kidding? My friends and I were graduating from living rooms, cars, and socially-distanced football fields. People took to the streets around the world to advocate for racial justice. And the 2020 United States presidential election, one that was as long as it was mentally tormenting, was in full swing. We all yearned for normalcy, but nothing about our lives was normal.While I had to begin my first year at Penn from my bedroom in China, I was determined to not let it diminish my experience. As such, over a Zoom meeting, I joined The Daily Pennsylvanian\u2019s multimedia department. As a staffer, I took photos in corners of my world that had any miniscule resemblance to the writers\u2019 experience in America. My first big assignment came when former photo editor Sukhmani Kaur asked me to stay up all night and edit photos as they rolled in on Election Day. What kind of first year gives up a night of sleep for a little club assignment? Not normal.Though my journey at the DP started with me completing one assignment every two weeks, I would have never foreseen how it would come to define my time at Penn.Being photo editor in 2022 allowed me to further see Penn through my camera lens. I skipped classes and meals to follow former Penn President Liz Magill to all corners of campus during the first 100 days of her tenure. I negotiated with the Secret Service to allow our own photography equipment into a campaign event with President Joe Biden and former President Barack Obama. I drove a group of photographers home at 4 a.m. after Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro and Dr. Mehmet Oz\u2019s respective election night parties. Normal? Hardly.As president in 2023, I would go on to sign my name on the dotted line and initiate the purchase of a permanent home for the DP. Our team weathered a pivotal chapter in Penn\u2019s history which culminated in the resignation of University leaders. In those months, I woke up to dozens of hate emails in my inbox every day, and our reporters worked around the clock to keep up with national news organizations which possessed more manpower and resources.\u00a0One of the copy editors on the 139th board, Allyson Nelson, quipped of the news cycle at Penn as \u201cwhen it rains, it pours.\u201d As fun (and often exhausting) as it was to spend an ungodly amount of time in our infamously windowless office and eat countless Zesto\u2019s pizzas, I also realized how abnormal of a collegiate experience it was. I was missing out on weeknight hangouts with friends, happy hours during restaurant week, formals, parties, and other archetypes of a \u201cnormal\u201d college experience. For the first two and a half of my three in-person years, my friends have considerately learned to not schedule dinners with me on weeknights.Not normal! (Shoutout to my friends for putting up with me).Though as time went on, I grew to love the abnormality. Reporting taught me how to work with tight deadlines and competing priorities. Photographing protests showed me the importance of connecting with different communities. Leading a team through crises challenged my empathy, grit, and social consciousness. The abnormality presented me with a unique skill set and undoubtedly shaped my character. Above all, I loved how it strengthened my optimism and resilience.Or maybe it\u2019s because I loved giving people ridiculous reasons on why I cannot make lunch: \u201cI HAVE TO go to the airport and photograph Air Force One.\u201dI am acutely aware of the fact that my sense of abnormality is not unique. In many ways, the normalcy the Class of 2024 yearned for at the start of our college years never arrived. While we no longer have to wear masks in classrooms or get swabbed twice a week in a giant air-ventilated tent, we are in the midst of another pivotal U.S. presidential election. We are having unprecedented discussions regarding First Amendment rights on college campuses, and our communities are feeling the inevitable ripples of conflicts across the world.Rather than letting these challenges loom over our impending graduation, we should consider the opportunities that they present. We are uniquely positioned to speak out about issues close to our hearts, have constructive conversations on the most contentious topics of the day, and act to improve the community around us.While the COVID-19 pandemic put in-person socializing on hold, we learned how to forge connections and friendships through screens. We saw the importance of becoming more self-educated and practicing our civic duties during the Black Lives Matter movement and the 2020 elections. Not since the civil rights movement and Vietnam anti-war protests of the 1960s has so much media attention been dedicated to college campuses across the country, and we must use what we learned from the abnormality of our college experience to rise up to the challenge.Between our myriads of farewell toasts, I realize that what began as a quest for normalcy evolved into an embrace of abnormality. Our college graduation is hardly the ultimate epilogue; it is merely the cliffhanger to the rest of our lives. The abnormality we saw throughout our time in college will undoubtedly change the ways in which we can and will approach the world. So in all the ways we are celebrating the Class of 2024 this graduation season, here\u2019s cheers to the abnormality that made us one of a kind.JESSE ZHANG is a Wharton senior studying business economics and public policy and marketing from Shenzhen, China.

          "title": "Esther Lim | Dear sports",
          "article_content": "I remember when I first watched your white net snap taut from a goal scored. Seeing the plus one on the scoreboard felt just like that rush I feel when the music is perfect and I row into top gear. I knew I\u2019d return for the next few matches at home. Even when the evening trains would rumble across the bridge behind Rhodes Field, and their terrific chug would drown out announcements of player substitutions that I really needed to hear, I was delighted I was the one to be there \u2014 soles suctioned to metal bleachers, fingers chilled stiff, and eardrums blitzed by bursts of crowd noise \u2014 to witness and write about it all.\nI loved my postgame sprints across the field to the home bench, holding two phones on record just in case one wouldn\u2019t be enough to catch every word of my interviews. I remember how the beginnings felt so unfamiliar, meeting and asking questions to names I'd already scrutinized from stat sheets and rosters. But any nerves sank when I remembered how much fun it was to talk about you.\n\t\tI loved watching all the ways you could move. Heels anchored into grass and how spines would pivot, or squeaks of sneakers on glossy hardwood below century-old Palestra rafters. I loved how it would all happen so fast. A baton pass as fluid as turning a page of a book, or the ferocious swings of rackets and sticks and bats to mash a bulleting ball. I sought the best words to capture you on the page.\nYou showed no fear and I wanted to feel that way, too. So I plunged into your momentum and kept up. I studied score sheets and rosters like homework. I squinted across courts and fields; memorized the numbers on players\u2019 backs until I could predict the timings of coaches\u2019 substitutions. I loved catching you off-guard to hear my favorite response: \u201cThat\u2019s a great question.\u201d And when anyone would begin to explain to me the game I knew I loved, I learned to straighten my shoulders and interrupt.\n\t\t\n\t\nI spent some years matching your pace. In return, you drew some of the best words out of me. Watching my bylines stack was a thrill I\u2019d share constantly with home, and it felt unreal to think how many people would read my work the next day. But you are rapid. Your routines kept rolling, and my writing grew mechanic. Obligations heaped. Your schedules began to weigh like an anchor on my joy, and what I had feared most would happen finally caught up to flatten my spirit: I grew tired.\nBut I wasn\u2019t tired of you. I will always love being obsessed with you. ESPN still overwhelms my notifications, and I\u2019ll hopefully watch you in a London stadium soon. Maybe I grew tired of knowing you so hard. Making my living in this city became an urgent test, and I rationed my time to be able to live. I didn\u2019t want you to feel like work, too.\n\tI wondered what kind of writer you wanted me to be. What it takes to be the first to break news, to understand every sport as much as my favorite, to learn generations of legendary names I didn\u2019t grow up with. I watched those around me do it excellently. I wondered if we all shared the same amount of hours. But reality had crashed into me like a wave, and when I finally learned how to keep my chin above the surface, I found no energy left to write you in my best words anymore.\nI remember on another sunny afternoon at work, while rolling crates of silverware and counting down my hours on the clock, I watched you through a dim, cracked phone screen showing the 2022 World Cup. At every goal scored, I could hear the roar of cheers from the opposite side of the kitchen pass \u2014 occasionally delayed, but nevertheless electric, even through the brunch noise. Here was that delight, again, in a place I didn\u2019t expect. I thought about the stories I had wanted to share when I first began writing. And watching you through a smaller screen, I wondered if my distance from your bigger headlines demanded something much greater than what I could give \u2014 a distance I wasn\u2019t confident I could close.\u00a0\nSo call me lazy or stale, unambitious at most. But I felt happy when I went to a soccer game with nothing to write. This wasn\u2019t work, but a passion enjoyed. No deadline to race, no weaving of nuanced questions for interviews, nor a fiery stance on zonal marking versus man-to-man to prove I know what I\u2019m talking about. I stood in the stands as just a fan of you. I rooted for a side, ignored the names of away team substitutions, and the delight of you returned.\nI couldn\u2019t become that trailblazer you craved. But now I\u2019ll settle for the gallery afar, watching you continue to flourish for your favorite kind of crowd. So let me flourish, too. I won\u2019t give all my words to you anymore \u2014 even if everything about you seemed so ideal in those evening hours, when the sun would set over the Schuylkill as the timeclock inched down, and the players on the field continued to just run, chasing you and one another into the back of that white net, and I was the one there to write about it all. You were a thrill unmatched, even as my own feet stood still. So perhaps I'll return to you sometime soon, when I've grown a little more in myself, and my view from the stands calls again to spill out into words.\nESTHER LIM is a College senior studying English with a concentration in creative writing from Georgia.

          "article_content": "If you\u2019re reading this self-serving trip down memory lane, you might be one of my friends and family. Or, more likely, you\u2019re trying to read about the encampment and got lost on The Daily Pennsylvanian\u2019s website.\nIf you\u2019re in the latter camp, just hit the menu button on the top left and go to news. And if you\u2019re reading this in the physical paper \u2026 Who am I kidding, nobody actually picks up one of those. But if you\u2019re one of my friends and family, I\u2019m going to tell a story you might have already heard. Bear with me.\n\t\tWhile I was sports editor, a group of us made the seven-hour commute to Hanover, N.H., to cover a football game at Dartmouth College. At the time, we did a \u201cPicks are In\u201d column, where we\u2019d predict each week\u2019s game. All but one of our writers picked Dartmouth, who were 11.5-point favorites.\u00a0\nCut to: Penn somehow wins in double overtime, I\u2019m in the process of writing what will become an extremely mediocre recap, and we\u2019re sitting in a nearly empty press conference waiting to speak to Penn\u2019s coach.\n\t\t\n\t\nOne of us eventually asked him, \u201cWhat message do you think this win sends to the rest of the Ivy League?\u201d While staring directly at us, he said, \u201cI don\u2019t think anyone gave us a chance today... People were writing stories without giving us Quakers a chance. So message: We are 3-0, ready to play another game next week.\u201d\u00a0\nI checked. We were the only ones that had written a word about this game.\n\tWe, a group of 20-year-olds, had published something that pissed off a Division I football coach, and when we were proven wrong, he rightly told us to our faces.\nIt was completely fair for him \u2014 who, I should mention, is a very nice guy \u2014 to call us out. And it gets at a key aspect of college sports journalism: It can be very bizarre.\u00a0\nOne time, I was covering a road football game from my room. I watched the game on TV, and a buddy of mine came in and watched with me. With 10 minutes to go, we were talking about a Penn running back that was tearing through Cornell\u2019s defense.\n\u201cOh yeah,\u201d I said. \u201cI'll probably talk to him.\u201d\nI was on the phone with the running back a little over 10 minutes later. As my friend sat bemused on my couch, the guy who just charged through linemen on my TV was on the phone with me so I could mumble disjointed questions at him.\nAgain, bizarre.\nFormer Sports Editor Brandon Pride and I once traveled to New York for a baseball series at Columbia University. In the second game of the series, Penn blew a six-run lead in the last couple innings and lost on a walk-off homer.\nRough way to lose. And rough for Brandon and me, who now had to talk to the coach about their collapse.\u00a0\nWe waited as the team emerged from the dugout, terrified of having to confront a coach whose team just lost in the worst way imaginable. As he came out, we told him who we were, and he quickly exclaimed, \u201cOh wow, thanks for coming out, guys!\u201d and couldn\u2019t have been any nicer.\nYou never know what to expect from the people you\u2019re interviewing. Like how you don\u2019t expect Rick Pitino to tell you and the rest of a cramped postgame press conference about how the NCAA got its comeuppance in his infamous \u201cladies of the night\u201d investigation.\nBut that\u2019s part of what makes this very specific brand of journalism so great, and the memories I have from it are some of the best from my time in college.\nAfter that Dartmouth game, we drove 45 minutes in the middle of the night to a place called \u201cD Acres Permaculture Farm & Educational Homestead.\u201d\nIf that sounds like it\u2019s not a luxury hotel, you would be correct. I\u2019d waited till the last couple days before our trip to book a hotel. Much to my surprise, it was Family Weekend at Dartmouth, which meant that all the hotels in Hanover were full. The only one available was D Acres, located more or less in the middle of nowhere.\u00a0\nIt was cheap, so D Acres had that going for it.\nWe drove up around midnight to what looked like a haunted house, unsure if we\u2019d end up sleeping in the car. To our surprise, it was actually quite nice. The room next to the kitchen was for butchering pigs, and you needed to pay with quarters to shower. But the beds were comfy, and we weren\u2019t in a tent like the website suggested we might be.\nFor less than $60 a person, it was a good value. Plus, like many trips, it was a night with friends that I\u2019ll never forget.\n\n\n\n\n                Photos courtesy of Matthew Frank\n      \n\n\nI\u2019ve written over 120 articles for the DP (yikes), and although a couple of those were actually pretty good, it\u2019s the memories and the friends that I\u2019ll be most proud of and thankful for about my time in DPOSTM (The DP\u2019s Only Section That Matters, for the uninformed).\nI\u2019m thankful for the guys on Sunday Shift\u2122, for being the only reason I\u2019d ever wake up before noon on a Sunday.

          "title": "Fiona Miller | Ambitions, amnesia, and ambivalence",
          "article_content": "When senior spring rolled around, a warning email from Career Advising landed in my inbox. URGENT. Apparently, my current enrollments would not complete my degree requirements. Apparently, I wouldn\u2019t graduate. As always, procrastination came back to bite me.\n\u201cSocial Impact and Responsibility: Foundations\u201d: the last class I needed to complete my concentration. As the name suggests, the course was meant to be entry-level, taken at the beginning of my academic journey, not at the tail end. Every semester, I pushed this three-hour seminar off. I could push it off no longer.\n\t\tAfter an email with my advisor, who not-so-politely suggested that I should have planned my course load better, I finally enrolled in Social Impact Foundations during my senior spring. A three-hour seminar, a foundations course as a senior \u2014 I couldn\u2019t wait.\nThe first assignment for the cursed course \u2014 which, due to my late enrollment, would be submitted well past the due date \u2014 was a legacy paper. In 2050, when you look back at your life (both personal and professional) what will you consider to be your main achievement \u2014 your legacy?\u00a0\nTo some, this assignment would kindly be referred to as easy and unkindly referred to as busy work. To a senior soon to be facing the real world, legacy was terrifying. All that mattered was what immediately lied in front of me: graduating, getting a job, getting into law school. I was too young to think about myself at age 48, and it was way too early to cement my legacy.\nLegacy? So terrified by this word, I had actually enrolled in and immediately dropped this course a year prior. Now, I was backed into a corner and forced to face my legacy head-on. I debated dropping my concentration entirely, but that meant admitting defeat to my concentration advisor. So I stayed in the course, mostly out of stubbornness and partly out of spite.\u00a0\n\tI began thinking back to the dreams I wrote about in my college application. Who was I when I came here?\nAt 18, I told my dad I wasn\u2019t applying to Penn. Why bother if there was no chance I would get in? In southwest Virginia, most of my peers would stay in-state or head down to Southeastern Conference schools. No one from my area had been to Penn in recent years; Philadelphia was a strange new land.\u00a0\nMy dad disagreed. Spoken like a recreational soccer coach, he replied: \u201cYou miss 100% of the shots you don\u2019t take.\u201d The what-ifs loomed too large to brush off. Hours before the deadline, I submitted my Wharton application. When decision day rolled around, my family and I jumped up and down in excitement \u2014 not over an acceptance, but over a spot on the waitlist. My shot in the dark was met with a wait and see, a more favorable outcome than a rejection. By a mix of luck, chance, and the rise of COVID-19 gap years, I was ultimately accepted. And with the payment of my deposit, Pandora\u2019s box was opened.\nAt 18, I knew all the numbers about Penn: rankings, post-graduate outcomes, CU limits, and course requirements. Over time, numbers became my litmus test. Numbers assured me I was on the right track. Apply for five clubs, like everyone else. Apply for dozens and dozens of internships, like everyone else. Stop sleeping eight hours a night \u2014 no one else does.\nEach year, the numbers told me there was more I could do. Another club, another leadership position, a more challenging minor, a more challenging career. Each NSO, I felt like Sisyphus, with any progress I made erased by another tick of the clock. The numbers stretched on. Better to have two internship offers than one, better to have three leadership positions than two, better to have four A\u2019s than three A minuses\u2026\u00a0\nLiving by the numbers was no way to live. Constantly comparing myself to my successful classmates was productive to no one and crippling to myself. At some point \u2014 far too late in my college career \u2014 I stopped trying to fit a standard I didn\u2019t believe in. Far too late, I resuscitated my ambitions from amnesia.\u00a0\nFlashing forward, I returned to the legacy paper. I knew the sources of my unhappiness at Penn. I knew I hated the numbers, the never-ending comparisons. Most importantly, I knew who I didn\u2019t want to be. For now, that could be enough. I wrote the legacy paper. I stayed in the three-hour seminar. I will graduate with the concentration that I applied to Penn with.\u00a0\n\t\tGet our newsletter, DP Daybreak, delivered to your inbox every weekday morning.As seniors know, much of spring term is reminiscing and remembering: thinking back to first-year roommates, old friend groups, long-abandoned majors and minors, and pre-professional tracks. The legacy paper, the bane of my existence, forced me to look both backwards and forwards. The assignment made me face uncomfortable questions of \u201cWhat does success mean to you?\u201d and \u201cWho even are you, really?\u201d\u00a0\nLike most seniors, I don\u2019t really know the answers. I am graduating with a degree that claims I know something when really, I feel more confused than I did at 18. But if four years at Penn has taught me anything, it\u2019s this: Comparison is truly the thief of joy. The only thing comparison has taught me is who I don\u2019t want to be.\u00a0\nFIONA MILLER is a Wharton senior studying behavioral economics and social impact from Roanoke, Va.

          "article_content": "\u201c5 Fun Things To Do in Philadelphia,\u201d read the subject line of my most recent email.\u00a0\nSitting in my childhood bedroom back in 2020, I curiously pondered over this random email that landed in my inbox. With no connection to the city, I didn\u2019t understand why this was relevant to me. I almost ignored it, if not for my superwoman of a mother who reminded me that I was still on Penn\u2019s waitlist. I had previously concluded that Penn was no longer a possibility, but thankfully, my mom urged me to check the portal anyway.\u00a0\n\t\tMy screen was adorned with red and blue confetti \u2014 I had, in fact, been accepted to Penn. After re-reading the acceptance letter about 15 times to make sure my eyes were not deceiving me, my heart sank when I noticed the date. I was accepted over a week prior, but I had no idea because I missed the original email notification.\u00a0\nIf I had not seen the subsequent email advertising Philadelphia\u2019s main attractions, I may have missed the deadline to make an enrollment decision, or I may have never even known that I got into Penn. I was so grateful to still have the chance to attend this prestigious university despite being so irresponsible, and I made a promise to take advantage of every opportunity this school offered.\u00a0\n\t\t\n\t\nAnd that I did.\u00a0\nMy Penn experience has been nothing short of fulfilling. Though my first year was characterized by measures of isolation (virtual classes, mandatory masks, grab-and-go dining), I had never felt more connected with others. Call it trauma bonding, but there is something unifying about being a \u201cCOVID freshman\u201d that only the Class of 2024 could ever understand.\n\tMy first year was also the time when I joined The Daily Pennsylvanian as an opinion columnist, and over the next four years, I would write, edit, podcast, and even create crossword puzzles. I learned how to navigate ruthless backlash from readers attacking my character and my intellect, and I served as a deputy editor during one of the most polarizing times in DP history \u2014 two formative experiences that have shaped who I am as a person and a writer. I credit the DP for planting the seeds of my future in journalism, and I would not have had the privilege of working for NBC News, CNN, and ABC News without my roots here.\u00a0\nAside from the career benefits, writing for the DP also presented opportunities to unravel years of internalized racism. My articles about Asian hate and xenophobia in Congress may not seem significant to the average reader, but this represented a huge step forward in not only accepting my racial identity, but being proud to publicly defend it. Coming from a predominantly white neighborhood and high school, I never truly felt comfortable in my own skin and even cringed at my culture. I am ashamed to admit this now, but I sought to assimilate by subconsciously surrounding myself with white friends, American cuisine, and white norms.\u00a0\nWhile this may sound like an absurd paradox, joining a sorority further prompted me to embrace my Asian identity. I began to see Asian women engaging in social endeavors and being welcomed in spaces that I had previously assumed were exclusive to white individuals. And though Greek life undoubtedly has a litany of faults in regards to diversity and inclusion, I do credit Penn\u2019s chapter of Alpha Phi for providing my first friendships with girls that actually looked like me. I have had some of the deepest conversations with these women regarding shared backgrounds, childhood similarities, and generational differences \u2014 topics that I never even fathomed to touch on beforehand.\u00a0\nThese social interactions remain my most treasured takeaway from college. Of course, all the sweaty frat basements, overpriced downtown events, and BYO dinners are core memories in my Penn experience. But rather than reminiscing about these drunken nights, I am more proud of the friendships that these social outings have rewarded me with. I have met my best friends that know me better than I know myself, some of whom I would quite literally consider to be family. I have learned about love and loyalty, support and sacrifice, trauma and tragedy.\nMy friends have also inspired me in a myriad of ways, and I\u2019ll never tire of watching them launch companies, save lives, and change the world. They dedicate their hearts and souls to every endeavor, including athletics, the arts, and other extracurricular activities. In fact, witnessing my peers\u2019 passions has served to revitalize my own. As a competitive figure skater for over 12 years who suffered from burnout and grew to despise the sport, I refused to step foot on the ice again. Though I joined the Penn Figure Skating Club during the fall of my first year, it was not until senior spring (seven semesters later) that I visited the Penn Ice Rink for the very first time. I regret how long it has taken, but it has been a beautiful journey receiving such profound support and falling back in love with the sport that defined me for over a decade.\u00a0\n\t\tGet our newsletter, DP Daybreak, delivered to your inbox every weekday morning.I could go on and on about the many things that Penn has taught me, but my mind always goes back to the day I discovered my Penn acceptance and the panic that ensued after realizing I opened the letter a week late. I often think about how different my life would have been had I continued to neglect my inbox, and I always come to the same conclusion: none of these experiences would have been the same, and many of these life lessons may have never come to fruition.\u00a0\nSo if there\u2019s one piece of advice I have to give, it is to check your email.

          "article_content": "Opinion applications for The Daily Pennsylvanian were due on a rainy, pandemic-era September day. Zoning out in a Zoom lecture, I wondered if I really wanted to put the effort into penning a sample column. Wouldn\u2019t I just get rejected?\nBut then I remembered what Mr. Henderson, my high school English teacher, wrote to me that spring. He said he associated me with the newspaper, complimenting my writing style and how I gave my all on every assignment. If at least one person thought that I belonged at the paper, I may as well give it my best shot.\u00a0\n\t\tIt\u2019s a pretty solid call to adventure, don\u2019t you think?\nWhen I started writing columns, I was scared stiff of saying something that would get construed the wrong way. I reviewed every last letter and punctuation mark of my drafts, and asked my friends to do the same. With that diligence, I grew as a writer. I started speaking up in meetings, and then, in my junior year, I led them as the opinion editor.\u00a0\n\t\t\n\t\nFor the longest time, I chose to interpret my time at Penn, and at the DP, as a kind of hero\u2019s journey, where I finish demanding assignments with aplomb, and every adversity teaches me a valuable lesson. Most of us do some version of that. We hope to graduate feeling triumphant, having risen through the ranks and gained expertise in the activities and academics that we invested in. We hope that our next steps involve a dream job or school \u2014 a dream life, even.\nI entered Penn my senior fall, eager to get my storybook resolution come graduation. Leaving my summer internship with glowing reviews from my mentors, I was assured of a return offer. And having made a pact with my friends to take no more than 5.5 CUs, I would be coasting, relative to my earlier 6.5 and 7 CU terms as a dual-degree student. This was the term where, instead of learning the ropes of Penn and fighting to stay afloat, I would explore and navigate new waters.\u00a0\n\tBut then, as the clock struck midnight and September began, my email inbox greeted me with a \u201cwe regret to inform you\u201d message from the company I had interned at \u2014 the first of many, many eventful emails in my inbox. I dropped down to 4.5 CUs after struggling with a coding assignment for 20-something hours, but my workload hardly let up after that.\nOver the following months, 30 and 40-hour weeks at the DP became my norm: speaking with our (incredibly, insanely dedicated) staffers and editing and fact-checking columns. I was hopping on phone calls and writing replies to email chains, dozens of messages deep in the middle of the night. By the end of the year, Opinion published over 200 staff and guest columns with diverse perspectives on campus life and current events \u2014 there is nothing I am prouder of having worked on at Penn.\nNone of it would have been possible without the immense support and kindness from so many wonderful, driven people. Thank you Emi, Imran, and Jesse \u2014 in the most tumultuous of times in the Pink Palace, I could count on you to advocate for Opinion and to give your all into leading the DP, which means more than words can express. Thank you Yomi, Vinay, and Emily for being the absolute best deputy editors Opinion 139 could ask for, and Matteo, for your careful sensitivity reading and suggestions. Thank you Derek, Benjamin, and all of Photo and Design for the beautiful doms, and for goofing off with me during production nights. Thank you Allyson, Julia, and all of Copy! You are the backbone of the DP.\nAnd of course, I am most grateful for the wit, enthusiasm, and commitment of every single columnist I have had the privilege to work with; your stories captivated thousands of minds and inspired countless debates.\nIf I was still going after that storybook resolution, I\u2019d tell you that upon retirement from the DP, I rode off into the sunset to some magnificent end-credits-style music. At our banquet, I was honored to receive the Editor of the Year award, and after applying to full-time positions for months, I suddenly had to decide between three great job offers over the span of two weeks.\nBut it\u2019s not all that simple \u2014 I\u2019ve learned this spring that 5.5 CUs can feel just as soul-sucking as 7 (thanks, NETS 2120), and I\u2019ve had my fair share of tough conversations, embarrassing slip-ups, and everyday misfortunes. With the turmoil and tensions both on campus and worldwide right now, it feels disingenuous to tell a story where everything wraps up neatly, with no loose ends.\nI said before that in a hero\u2019s journey, each adversity teaches you a lesson \u2014 but that\u2019s not how life actually works. Sometimes, you just screw up, for no reason other than bad luck or a bout of clumsiness. Sometimes, there\u2019s no purpose to it: only pain.\nBecause of that, I\u2019ve given up on the hero\u2019s journey altogether. Shifting away from grandiose but precarious narratives that hinge on external validation, like acceptances and awards, I now prefer to focus my story on the day-to-day minutiae that bring me joy and stability. It is filled with lovely little moments, like chatting with my roommates over spicy, piping-hot bowls of instant ramen, or taking in the fresh air and ambiance as I walk through the Woodlands.\u00a0\n\t\tGet our newsletter, DP Daybreak, delivered to your inbox every weekday morning.My life feels far fuller with this type of story than when I\u2019ve tried to contort my time at Penn into a narrative with some meaningful conclusion to it all. I have flourished in many ways here. But in others, I am very much a work-in-progress, and that\u2019s perfectly fine. I hope that you will come to adapt your stories as you grow and change too \u2014 sticking with a rigid narrative for too long is no fun.\nI suppose I\u2019ll end here on the same line that got me into this whole (glorious) mess in hopes that it inspires somebody else: whoever you are, if you so desire, you can belong at the paper. Start writing stories, and never stop. Be curious and skeptical about every narrative you examine \u2014 ask lots of questions and raise objections when you see fit.

          "title": "Riane Lumer | The social clock is ticking, according to who?",
          "article_content": "Five years ago during a college tour trip, I vividly recall sitting in a hotel, gazing out the window at the skyline of Boston. I felt inspired; I was eager to write my supplemental essays about why I wanted to attend Boston College (BC), and why I wanted to become a teacher. BC\u2019s Lynch School of Education and Human Development attracted me because of its education program.\nThis tour was a few weeks before I was selected to present a speech at the back-to-school convocation in front of every K-12 teacher in the district on my passions for education and teaching. Becoming a teacher was a personality trait for me. \u201cMost likely to become part of Lower Moreland Faculty: Riane Lumer.\u201d I even won a scholarship award for someone potentially entering the field of education. \u201cWe\u2019ll be colleagues one day!\u201d my choir director constantly joked my senior year. \u201cYou\u2019ll take over the organization in the future,\u201d my Mini-THON advisor told me.\u00a0\n\t\tI had wanted to be an English teacher since I was in fifth grade \u2014 or so I thought.\nMy sophomore year at BC, I student-taught at Brighton High School, a turnaround Boston public school in Massachusetts. This was something I was itching to do throughout my first year. I just wanted to get in the classroom.\u00a0\n\t\t\n\t\nLike most city schools, students in the urban district are victims of pervasive systemic disparities that contribute to educational debt. I recognized this upon the first day of my pre-practicum and felt a need to assist on a political level. My passion for reform only intensified after more time connecting with students.\u00a0\nBut this desire extends beyond the role of a teacher. \u201cThere\u2019s only so much a teacher can do within the classroom for change,\u201d I thought to myself.\u00a0\n\tAnd so, after a month of teaching, I began to heavily question a future in it. That frightened me\u00a0\u2014 leading me to suppress these feelings until the end of the semester, when I truly began to consider that this really wasn\u2019t the path for me. I didn\u2019t want to swallow that pill. I didn\u2019t think I knew myself without it.\nI was grieving a dream that died, a future for myself that no longer matched what I had imagined for years. New experiences and exposures changed me and sparked bigger aspirations. But I also felt as though I failed myself; my family always told me teaching wasn\u2019t for me, and I thought I was rebelling. Well, they were right, but for different reasons.\u00a0\nI added a third major: political science. But I was faced with another dilemma. The licensure teaching program at BC was the last thing keeping me there. And the summer prior to that, the excitement for student-teaching and jump-starting my career in education counteracted my detached emotions toward the atmosphere of BC.\u00a0\nI applied to transfer to NYU during the spring semester of my sophomore year. I enrolled in their education school, but I didn\u2019t attend. I wanted to give BC one more shot: it was my top choice, and I wanted it to feel the way I expected. And I wanted my zeal for teaching to return, because that was all I thought I knew and was attached to. That linear path was comforting to me. It was something that I felt was within my grasp and control.\nOn May 18, 2022, I received my acceptance to Penn as a junior transfer majoring in political science. Yes, a junior transfer who also was entering with a new major that they had only taken one course for at their prior institution.\u00a0\nEmbracing my desire to transfer and reshape my career trajectory ignited my newfound eagerness to continuously explore new avenues that ignite my joy and curiosity. When I got onto Penn\u2019s campus, I applied to join The Daily Pennsylvanian\u2019s opinion and podcast departments and became a writer for 34th Street Magazine. At BC, I was involved primarily in educationally-oriented activities. It was my whole world; anything like writing for the student newspaper felt irrelevant to my future career. I was wrong and naive. And I ended up writing about it.\u00a0\nBecause of my experiences at the DP and with my journalistic writing minor, I explored the world of journalism \u2014 a discipline one of my English professors at BC suggested would be a good fit for me. But I refused to depart from what I thought was my path, until my college experience took an unexpected turn on its head.\u00a0\nCurrently, I\u2019m unsure exactly what the future holds for me, but I am learning to find peace in all of the possibilities. When I transferred, I abandoned the habit of attempting to assume control over every aspect of my life and plan each detail. Instead, I embrace the uncertainty of the future and approach my twenties as a blank canvas, ready to be painted with new experiences and opportunities.\u00a0\nMy college experience has been anything but conventional. Although I will be walking across the stage this month, I will not be officially graduating until December \u2014 another detour from what I expected when transferring to Penn and assuming I would \u201cgraduate on time.\u201d\nWhen I met with my advisor and he broke the news to me that I would not be graduating \u201con time,\u201d I panicked and my stomach dropped. Instinctively, I felt that I was falling behind. But in the aftermath of that moment, I began to question the concept of \u201con time.\u201d What does it truly mean? Especially for me? I realized that this phrase carries little significance \u2014 it's more about when things unfold as they're meant to. The right time is when it happens, and this fall, I will be embarking on another chapter by participating in the Penn in Washington program in D.C. (another transfer application bucket list item!).\u00a0\nThe social clock, a sociological theory identified by Bernice Neugarten, is a timetable of expectations for reaching milestones in your life predicated on external pressures and cultural norms embedded into societal structures. But as I have come to view it, the pressures of the social clock can seep into every level of decision-making in your life, if you allow it to sway you in determining how to act according to what you believe society would expect of you, or adhering to what others are doing around you.\u00a0\nI fell victim to this when experiencing dilemmas about my future. Now, I check myself as I fall into its harmful cycles time and time again. During rush, girls consistently asked me what post-grad job I had lined up or where I would be living. I didn\u2019t know, but I was no longer embarrassed. Everyone has their own timelines, and we are all working to figure them out. The rigorous, hyper-competitive nature of Penn especially subscribes to the demands of the social clock, so beware.\u00a0\nI find that the best way to withdraw yourself from this phenomenon is to know yourself. To listen to yourself. I encourage you to ask yourself, who are you? What sparks your curiosity? What excites you? What makes you tick? Are you driven by passions you have developed, or are you driven to fit the mold of what you think society expects of you?\u00a0\nAs I write this on my last day of classes at Penn, I sit at my desk reflecting on the past two years of my journey while a mug gifted from Penn\u2019s Transfer Student Organization to seniors sits next to my computer reading, \u201cI survived transferring.\u201d\u00a0\n\t\tGet our newsletter, DP Daybreak, delivered to your inbox every weekday morning.Yes, I did. But more importantly, I've transformed into a person I never envisioned \u2014\u00a0I was so overly fixated on preserving what felt safe and comfortable that I lost sight of who I was actually evolving into. \u00a0\nI leave with a reminder to my future self and to all of you: It's okay to outgrow places, people, things, habits, visions, or worldviews. Don't feel guilty about change and growth \u2014 untether yourself as you enter into new phases. We are here to exist, enjoy, experience, not to entertain a procedural social clock that may deter you from who you really are.\u00a0\nRIANE LUMER is a College senior studying political science and journalistic writing from Huntingdon Valley, Pa.

          "title": "Allyson Nelson | If you love something, let it go",
          "article_content": "Of the dozens of campus tours I\u2019ve given for the Kite and Key Society, each one has been different. I\u2019d switch out old stories for new ones or change how I\u2019d present information to prospective students and their families. The start of my tours, however, always remained the same:\n\"Penn was founded in 1740 by Benjamin Franklin. He was a founding father of the United States, printer, inventor, and so much more. Franklin didn\u2019t like to be defined by just one thing, and that\u2019s the spirit we love to embody through interdisciplinary experiences here at Penn.\"\n\t\tI said these lines almost every week for my three years as a tour guide, yet I never thought of internalizing them myself. Even though I had varying interests both inside and outside of the classroom, I defined my identity as the girl who worked for The Daily Pennsylvanian for the majority of my time as a Penn student.\nThe DP was the first organization that I joined at Penn. As a lonely first-year student going stir-crazy in my bedroom due to the COVID-19 pandemic, I elected to join a club during my spring semester to give myself something to do outside of my schoolwork. After aimlessly scrolling through the Penn Clubs website, I stumbled upon the DP\u2019s page. My high school didn\u2019t have a newspaper, so I was weary of writing. But I\u2019ve always loved grammar. Thus, my love of copy editing was born.\n\t\t\t\tSEE MORE FROM ALLYSON NELSON:\ufeffPenn softball swept by Harvard'A perfect fit': Penn softball's Megan Huang is off to a strong startEverything after that point was a blur. I entered the DP\u2019s Pink Palace for the first time when COVID-19 restrictions were lifted, learned the intricacies of fact-checking and style editing, and realized that I was part of something much bigger than myself. I sought leadership as soon as I was able, and before I knew it, my entire world revolved around the DP.\nI prioritized the DP above all else. I\u2019d push off assignments to edit articles, tune out in class to look over a breaking story and cancel plans with friends to take on extra DP work. Even as a deputy copy editor, the DP was a full-time job. And when I finally became one of the two head copy editors on the 139th Board, I felt like I was always working overtime. If I wasn\u2019t actively editing, I was thinking about the DP. I kept my phone on me at all times, anxious that a breaking story would suddenly come through and I\u2019d need to edit at a moment\u2019s notice.\n\tIt slowly dawned on me after my first semester as copy editor that this life was no longer sustainable. The DP was negatively impacting my academic life, personal relationships, and mental health, and there was only so much more I could handle. Coinciding with the fact that I had just been elected summer executive editor \u2014 meaning I hadn\u2019t taken any extended time off from the DP in two years \u2014 I knew that I needed change. So what did I do? I accepted leadership positions in other clubs alongside my work at the DP.\nTo the naked eye, this decision seemed insane. But what I realized in my first semester as copy editor is that I didn\u2019t know how to tell the DP no. I took on work that I didn\u2019t have to simply because I didn\u2019t have a reason not to. With new responsibilities elsewhere on campus, particularly with Kite and Key and Social Planning and Events Committee Connaissance, I learned that it was okay to take time away from the DP to pursue other opportunities that excited me. These leadership roles taught me how to manage over 100 people, plan large-scale events, and work with major Penn offices, which is something I did not have the ability to do at the DP.\nThis was one of the best decisions I\u2019ve ever made at Penn. Finding other communities on campus made me realize how much I loved the DP. That\u2019s not to say that my other communities were lesser than \u2014 they certainly weren\u2019t \u2014 but taking a step back from the DP allowed me to appreciate the work that I was beginning to resent. I didn\u2019t always groan when a new article to edit was sent to me, nor would I dread having to go into the office. For the first time in a while, I was excited about the DP.\nThis new perspective allowed me to grow even closer with my DP community. My love had never waivered for them before, but my changed outlook made me appreciate their support so much more. It takes a village to keep the DP going, and I am so grateful that I got to work alongside some of the most passionate and motivated people at Penn.\nJulia was the best co-copy editor I could ask for, and our work would not have been possible without the dedication of our wonderful copy deputies \u2014 Charlotte, Diamy, Eleanor, Laura, Maddie, and Riley \u2014 and our equally amazing copy associates. Emi, Imran, and Walden were such strong leaders throughout my time on board, and they believed in me when I could not believe in myself. I am also thankful for Alexis and Caleb, the 139 sports editors, who welcomed me with open arms when I wanted to give sports writing a try as a junior.\n\t\tGet our newsletter, DP Daybreak, delivered to your inbox every weekday morning.My time at the DP would not have been possible without the people who came before me. I am grateful for my copy editor predecessors, Brittany and Sophie, and am also thankful for Delaney, Jonah, and Tyler, who started as my mentors but ended up becoming my closest friends.\nI always ended my tours by saying that if I had to go through the college application process 100 times over, I\u2019d still choose Penn every time. The same goes for the DP. My time in the Pink Palace taught me to be detail-oriented, how to work under pressure, compromise with people who you may not agree with, and \u2014 most importantly \u2014 the difference between an em-dash and an en-dash. Despite the bumps in the road, I\u2019m so glad that the DP was the headline of my Penn experience \u2014 even if it took me time to appreciate it fully.\nALLYSON NELSON is a College senior studying English and American history from Philadelphia.

          "title": "Tulia Falleti | The aftermath I had feared is here",
          "article_content": "Guest columnist Tulia Falleti writes to resign from the position of Chair of the Faculty Senate.Early on the morning of May 10, in less than one hour, the Philadelphia police removed the Gaza Solidarity Encampment protesters from the College Green of our campus. Penn students, staff, and faculty, with their hands zip-tied behind their backs, were separated one by one from those embracing them as they sat on the ground or locked arms around the iconic Ben Franklin statue. Not a punch or a rock was thrown; no one so much as spat.\u00a0\nSince April 25, as Chair of the Faculty Senate, I have observed the encampment, walking by its perimeter several times a day. It was a peaceful protest. I wrote so in a guest column published in The Daily Pennsylvanian on May 4, and I stand by my assessment. On May 6, during one of my visits to the perimeter of the encampment, I noticed a person standing behind the white board that announced the events for the day. I entered the encampment a few feet to read the back of the white board. Listed there were 14 \u201cCommunity Guidelines and Principles.\u201d Number 10 read: \u201cDo not engage with counter-protesters or bad-faith agitators.\u201d\u00a0\n\t\tDuring the two weeks of the encampment, despite events of individualized harassment and intimidation against protesters that were reported to the Penn police and to the Committee on Open Expression, protesters remained non-violent. The speed with which the police were able to dismantle the protest is itself evidence of the protesters\u2019 refusal to resort to violence. Members of our community who characterize chants, signs, flags, even graffiti (which our student protesters covered and asked to be removed) or paint on our beloved founder Ben Franklin\u2019s statue as forms of violence need to turn on their TVs and tune in to violent protests or war scenes from around the world. We can certainly talk about symbolic violence or of hurtful forms of expression, but no one in our campus can say that the encampment that was on College Green from April 25 until this morning \u2014 and that included not only Penn members but also members of the larger Philadelphia community \u2014 has caused any physical harm or physical violence.\u00a0\nThe encampment grew on the evening of May 8, which was of great concern to me. In a worldwide, student-led social movement, in which the encampment \u2014 i.e. peaceful protest with tents \u2014 is a strategy for protest or part of its main repertoire, its modus operandi, and is the only bargaining power that protesters have, the growth of the encampment\u2019s footprint could only indicate one reality: negotiations with the University administration were not progressing. Was the University negotiating in good faith and with respect for the student protesters as our former President Sheldon Hackney had done when negotiating divestment from South Africa in the early 1980s? I could not tell. Did the encampment occupy part of our University\u2019s lawns? Yes, a tiny fraction of those campus properties on which the institution does not pay property taxes and which expand over a significant part of West Philadelphia. Was it disruptive to our educational mission? No, it was not. The building closest to the encampment, College Hall, is under construction, and as of May 1, there are no more classes on campus. Van Pelt Library is across from the encampment, but even when the chants were at some of their highest volume, our students were studying undisturbed in the library. Students also took graduation photos around the encampment, both in front of College Hall and at the Button and the LOVE statue. It was only on the evenings of May 8 (when negotiations had stopped) and May 9 and this morning that university operations were interrupted as the University prepared to clear the encampment. Had the University taken a different approach, our educational activities and access to buildings would have continued uninterrupted.\u00a0\n\t\t\n\t\nI was ending my first year of high school when the last military dictatorship came to an end in my native Argentina. The following year, with my fellow high-school students, we were able to do what the generation before ours could not: We could go into the streets and protest, and we could also occupy our buildings in protest. The generation before mine had been arrested, killed, and disappeared for protesting \u2014 even when the cause was free public transit rides for students. Thanks to our newly regained democracy, my classmates and I could join almost weekly protests in support of democracy, of human rights, of justice, or workers\u2019 rights. And our sit-ins and building occupations always ended with good faith negotiations, never by force. Those were formative political experiences that shaped my future civic and political life and oriented me toward becoming a social scientist and an educator.\u00a0\nToday, I am heartbroken that my university, the institution where I have taught, carried out my research, and worked in service of our students, staff, and faculty in myriad ways for over twenty years, has decided to send in the police to arrest its own students, staff, and faculty. I have been asked if I would hold the same position if the protesters were part of a worldwide encampment movement that was pro-abortion or against immigration. My answer is unequivocally \u201cYes!\u201d I would defend and uphold their right to peacefully protest, because this is a fundamental bedrock right of democracy. The fact that this protest \u2014 like the Occupy Wall Street or the rent protest movements before \u2014 used tents should have led our university community to talk about our land, how we occupy it, how it is taxed (or not) by our city, how it serves our mission, and how we use it. At this precise moment, in fact, the construction work that is going on around College Hall has occupied a larger footprint of our College Green area than the encampment did. Moreover, unlike other universities that use their main green area for graduation, we hold our convocations and graduations in our football stadium, so there was no reason to rush to remove the encampment as the semester came to an end and graduation was due to take place in ten days and over two blocks from College Green. The fact that there were Penn students, staff, and faculty complaining about speech content should have led to discussions about free speech, not censorship. And the fact that order is \u201crestored\u201d by sacrificing rights to free speech and to non-violent protest is exactly what autocracies around the world do now and what dictatorships have done throughout history to repress civic movements and suppress rights. Moreover, the decision itself is shortsighted. The encampment can be removed today, but the worldwide student-led movement will not end.\u00a0\n\tAccording to our rules, as Chair of the Faculty Senate I was not elected but appointed instead by a small Nominating Committee of nine peers. This undemocratic process notwithstanding, I am confident that by upholding our rules and procedures, I could have continued to strive to represent the vast majority of the members of the standing faculty at Penn. For instance, our Senate Executive Committee agreed yesterday to encourage \u201cboth\u00a0the\u00a0administration\u00a0and\u00a0the negotiating team of the student-led movement\u00a0to\u00a0keep\u00a0negotiating\u00a0in\u00a0good\u00a0faith, to de-escalate, and to seek a peaceful resolution.\u201d I would have been thrilled to carry that message if there was anyone to hear it today. I am, however, no longer confident of my ability to work collaboratively with our administration that has sent in the police to arrest its own students, staff, and faculty for participating in a non-violent protest. Thus, I am hereby presenting my resignation as Chair of the Faculty Senate of the University of Pennsylvania.\u00a0\nAs a member of the standing faculty, I will continue to defend academic freedom, free speech, and due process at our university. After serving as Chair-elect and then Chair of the Faculty Senate during the last two years, I am more aware and cognizant than ever of our Faculty Handbook, our Statutes of the Trustees (in particular, Article 11), our essential Guidelines on Open Expression, our carefully structured disciplinary processes for students, our need for academic freedom, and the importance of our shared governance. I am also keenly aware of the challenges that our University has faced in the last year and that are of public knowledge. As two colleagues have recently argued, our University\u2019s rules have been written in times of calm to be applied in times of upheaval. As a faculty member, I will make every effort to ensure that our rules and procedures are followed without bias and without manipulation. That our students, staff, and faculty are treated fairly. If universities such as Penn become one-sided, partisan, and biased, if they give in to external pressures for either political or financial reasons, then there is no hope for higher education in this country or the world. The larger threat is to democracy itself, because such manipulation of our rules, policies, and procedures can only take place in non-democratic institutions.\u00a0\nI leave my leadership role in the Faculty Senate with the following unsolicited words of advice to our administration, our Trustees, our boards\u2019 advisors, and to my fellow colleagues. It comes from our students: \u201cWe commit to assuming the best intentions, granting ourselves and others grace when mistakes are made and approaching conflict with the goal of addressing, repairing, and restoring.\u201d (Guideline number eight of the Penn encampment disbanded today.) May I have the wisdom of our students and future leaders to live up to this principle in the weeks and months to come, given the mistakes committed at Penn today.\u00a0\nTULIA FALLETI is a professor of political science and the former chair of the Faculty Senate.

          "title": "George Honig | It was a mistake to send in the police to end the encampment",
          "article_content": "As an alumnus of Penn, I received communication from the University a few days ago regarding the removal by Penn Police in riot gear (with the assistance of the Philadelphia Police Department) of the encampment of students protesting Israel's violations of the human rights of Palestinians in Gaza. The University's actions have not been fair or even-handed to these students, and I believe the administration is on the wrong side of history. \u00a0\nIn my view, the students\u2019 demands have been reasonable and just, as this war shows no signs of ending. On Oct. 7, a Hamas raid (which I have condemned) killed 1,100 Israelis. Today, Israel's eight-month military operations have killed 40,000 people, displaced nearly 2 million, and destroyed more than 50% of the buildings in Gaza. What Israel has done is not justice or defense, but rather barbarism and immorality by the standards of the Jewish, Christian, or Muslim religions, or by any reasonable standard of international law. It is for this reason that the International Court of Justice has allowed a case for genocide to proceed against Israel. \u00a0\n\t\tI was especially appalled that dozens of Penn faculty members traveled to Israel in January and met with Israeli President Isaac Herzog, who is specifically mentioned in the International Court of Justice finding. This is equivalent to a faculty member meeting with Vladimir Putin or Slobodan Milo\u0161evi\u0107. I cannot believe that any Arab, Palestinian, or Muslim student could think that they would be treated fairly by these faculty.\nTo say that Penn has been even-handed in its dealings with pro-Israeli and pro-Palestinian students is demonstrably false. Shortly after Oct. 7, Penn convened an antisemitism task force, which was done in partnership with the American Jewish Committee, and we have received continuous communication about this committee. I call on Penn to immediately establish a task force to specifically address Islamophobia and anti-Arab and anti-Palestinian racism on campus, and that this task force work in cooperation with the Council on American-Islamic Relations and the American-Arab Anti-Discrimination Committee. \u00a0\n\t\t\n\t\nI also call on Penn to evaluate investments in any activity which may violate human rights or international law. Such an approach needs to be applied to Israel in light of events in Gaza, but should also be applied to any other countries committing war crimes or human rights violations.\nThe demands of the students protesting on College Green were just by any reasonable standards. The University refused offers of mediation by several members of the Philadelphia City Council. Penn's actions do not enhance public safety and will produce a chilling effect on free speech in the future. I call on Penn to drop any charges against the students involved in the encampment, and apologize to the community for excessive use of force.\n\tI am currently a Platinum-level alumni donor to Penn. I am currently serving on the alumni admissions committee, and I am active in the Penn and Wharton clubs of Chicago. I will continue to support the University, but I want to reiterate how very disappointed I am in Penn's response to this crisis.\nGEORGE HONIG is a 1987 Wharton graduate.

          "article_content": "The Gaza Solidarity Encampment was disbanded on May 10.We are members of Penn Faculty Against Antisemitism (PFAA) who write to express our concern about the recent events on our campus; namely, the increase in discord within our community. First, we would like to thank Interim Penn President Larry Jameson and the administration, Penn Police, Philadelphia Mayor Cherelle Parker, and the Philadelphia Police Department for the effective, efficient, and professional clearing of the encampment to return our campus to a safe place for all students and faculty.\u00a0\nNobody wants our students to be harmed, and we do not wish to penalize anyone who is practicing their right to free expression. However, we are hopeful that the University will engage in a thorough and fair disciplinary process to ensure that students and faculty who are not adhering to the code of conduct face appropriate consequences for inciting hate and creating a threatening campus environment. This should apply to anyone fomenting hate and encouraging destruction of property. We recognize that many of these people are not students on this campus. We condemn any further escalation, especially by non-Penn agitators, and look forward to a safe and meaningful conclusion to the academic term, including long-awaited graduations, commencement, and class reunions.\u00a0\n\t\tWe welcome civil and respectful discussion. We advocate for the release of the hostages and elimination of Hamas and other organizations funded by terrorism as a critical goal to achieve in reaching an end to this war. We cannot move on as a community until we can come together as a community. The entire country is heartbroken that it has come to this with many of the college encampments, but the only way forward is to choose dialogue and understanding over hate. We are all working for a better present in hopes of creating a better future. Let us try to emerge from this experience with a renewed desire to talk and listen to one another rather than screaming across the divide.\nSigned,\n\t\t\n\t\nBenjamin Abella, MD; Perelman School of Medicine (PSOM)\nLindsey Albenberg, DO; PSOM\n\tSamuel Alperin, MD; PSOM\u00a0\nDanielle Barber, MD, PhD; PSOM\nKara Bernstein, PhD; PSOM\nMelissa Bleicher, MD; PSOM\nAkiva Cohen, PhD; PSOM\nDebbie Cohen, MD; PSOM\nGaia Coppock, MD; PSOM\nBrian Englander, MD; PSOM\nJoyce Epelboim, MD; PSOM\nBelen Esparis, MD; PSOM\nRachel Hachen, MD, MPH; PSOM\nUri Hangorsky, DDS; Penn Dental Medicine (PDM)\nJessica Hilburg, DDS; PDM\nJudith Kelsen, MD; PSOM\nSarah Lo, MD, MPH; PSOM\nDafna Ofer, MD; PSOM\nPam Pojomovsky McDonnell, MD; PSOM\nRebecca Seshasai, MD, MSHP; PSOM\n\t\tGet our newsletter, DP Daybreak, delivered to your inbox every weekday morning.Edna Schwab, MD; PSOM\nAri Weintraub, MD; PSOM\nMatthew Weitzman, PhD; PSOM\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tThe Daily Pennsylvanian is an independent, student-run newspaper.

          "article_content": "I often teach capstone research courses and supervise honors theses for the health & societies major. Some of my students use historical methods to answer their research questions. Occasionally, a student asking a historical question will explore The Daily Pennsylvanian's archives. My students have experienced surprise, delight, and sometimes shock when combing through old DP articles and learning about local, national, and international issues important to previous generations of Penn students.\nOver the past two weeks, I, like many other Penn faculty members, have deeply appreciated the professionalism and commitment of our student journalists. DP journalists have reported tirelessly about the encampment on our College Green.\n\t\tI was stunned, therefore, when I got to campus around 7:30 a.m. today, to see that police were not allowing DP reporters inside the barricade to report on the encampment removal. I asked two DP reporters and one DP photographer, who were being blocked by a line of police officers with batons, why they weren\u2019t being allowed in. \u201cThey don\u2019t take us seriously,\u201d one reporter replied. Meanwhile, I saw a reporter for a network news channel allowed to head up Locust Walk to College Green.\nA Philadelphia Inquirer article reported later today that another DP journalist, who arrived at College Green at 5 a.m. before the dismantling of the encampment began, was \u201cgrabbed by two Penn police officers and moved back from the statue. \u2018I kept saying I was a student and a member of the press,\u2019 the reporter said. \u2018I kept on asking why I wasn\u2019t allowed to be there, and I would get no responses.\u2019\u201d\n\t\t\n\t\nWhile I assume that at some point, the police must have allowed some members of the DP inside the barricade, I just want DP student journalists to know that I take you seriously. The faculty I have spoken to about the encampment over the past couple of weeks take you seriously. Historians take you seriously. Generations of future scholars take you seriously.

          "article_content": "Professors Ann Farnsworth-Alvear and Zita Cristina Nunes urge us to read Penn\u2019s Guidelines on Open Expression, arguing that it would be a perversion of those guidelines for the University to discipline students organizing the encampment on College Green, or to take any measures to end the encampment other than negotiation with the protesters. I have taken their advice and read those Guidelines and find nothing that mandates negotiation as the only appropriate response by the University.\nFarnsworth-Alvear and Nunes cite the part of the Guidelines that states that \u201cIn case of conflict between the principles of the Guidelines on Open Expression and other University policies, the principles of the Guidelines shall take precedence,\u201d (Guidelines I.D), but they interpret this as if it meant that no University policy may be enforced if it restricts open expression by students. This is a misreading of that clause since that document itself makes reference to disciplinary procedures (Guidelines V.D) and mandates the University establish policies and procedures for securing permission to hold demonstrations on campus (Guidelines III.A.2.b). As I read Interim Penn President Larry Jameson\u2019s letter to the Penn community on May 6, the University has determined that the current encampment on College Green is in violation of those policies and procedures (among others), and has instructed the encampment to disperse (in line with Guidelines III.B and V.C). Since the protesters have not complied with this instruction (thus falling under Guidelines III.B), the disciplinary procedures invoked in Guidelines V.D come into play. The Guidelines also discuss the possibility of \u201c[t]erminating a meeting, event, or demonstration by force,\u201d (Guidelines V.C.4), about which it urges extreme caution, citing the possibility of exacerbating existing tensions, and the concern to avoid \u201cinjury to persons\u201d and \u201cproperty damage.\u201d\n\t\tMy point is that the University\u2019s current response to the encampment, which involves initiating the student disciplinary process against organizers yesterday, and using police to shut down the encampment this morning, is in line with its own Guidelines for Open Expression.\nSUSAN SAUV\u00c9 MEYER is a retired professor of philosophy.

          "title": "Ben Messafi | The encampment is self-destructing ",
          "article_content": "More than one week into the encampment on College Green, with over 150 incidents of antisemitism and harassment reported to Penn Hillel, the public endorsement of two United States-designated terrorist organizations, and two American flags planted near the encampment being forcibly removed and damaged by protesters, students have had enough. It is time to end this antisemitic and anti-American encampment now.\u00a0\nOn April 26, pro-Israeli and Jewish students sponsored a screening of the Oct. 7 massacre adjacent to the Button on campus, broadcasting the screen in the direction of the encampment. Standing just outside the encampment when the video was playing, I heard three protesters clapping and cheering as a video of an Israeli woman getting raped and paraded in the streets of Gaza was displayed. The night before, I spotted a protester wearing a sweater with a Star of David and two rats depicted on the back, which imitates Nazi-style propaganda from the 1930s.\u00a0\n\t\tThe following night, protesters were recorded cheering \u201cAl Qassem make us proud, take another soldier down.\u201d Al Qassem is the military wing of Hamas, the group behind the Oct. 7 rape, mass murder, and abduction of Israeli civilians that has contributed to the deaths of thousands of Israelis and Palestinians since it took control of Gaza in 2007.\u00a0\nLast Tuesday, I walked near the encampment and saw a large PFLP (Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine) flag flying, which is a U.S.-designated terror organization. PFLP has been behind numerous terror attacks against Israeli civilians, including the hijacking in 1976 that diverted a flight leaving Israel to Entebbe, Uganda, and the raid of a Jerusalem synagogue, killing four in 2014. PFLP also opposes all negotiations with Israel and only envisions a Middle East without a Jewish state.\n\t\t\t\tEven worse, Penn\u2019s anonymous social media app, Sidechat, has been filled with an increasing number of pro-Palestinian supporters at Penn speaking out against the encampment, citing the diversion of the encampment from the values of the protest. Instead of protesting for the establishment of a Palestinian state and the end of the war, the encampment has turned this movement into an antisemitic cesspool, where students cannot walk on campus with Judaica items without being harassed by protesters. Even worse, not all members are students. When I attempted to look inside the encampment several days ago, I was approached by two protesters acting as \u201cguards.\u201d They did not name themselves, but they both acknowledged that they were not students, just Philadelphia residents with no association to Penn. Why should people outside of the Penn community have the ability to use Penn property to sleep and harass Jewish students? Why are non-Penn affiliates determining who is and who is not allowed on parts of our campus?\nOn April 29, pro-Palestinian protesters stormed Hamilton Hall at Columbia University, shattering the front windows and taking one security guard hostage. NYPD then forcefully removed the protesters, facing instant backlash. With Columbia's administration being hesitant to clear up the protest, students were able to easily obtain access to the building and vandalize it. As the protests at Penn are continuing to radicalize, the administration must follow through on their promise to clear the encampment before it is too late. Penn could be next.\u00a0\n\tSupporting the encampment and the groups they endorse is preventing any meaningful action and dialogue from occurring at Penn. Instead of speaking to diverse groups of students about their experiences with the conflict, the encampment is choosing to invite individuals outside of the Penn community to come to Penn and harass Jewish students. Instead of inviting leaders of the Jewish community to speak with students on the other side to discuss issues and common ground, the Chabad rabbi is being denied entry into the encampment because he is visibly Jewish. Instead of making Jewish students willing to talk to pro-Palestinian protesters about points of common ground, Jewish students are being harassed with Nazi-era rhetoric and praising of terrorist organizations that want to annihilate Jews from this planet.\nIf we want real action and dialogue to occur on this campus, continuing to support an encampment that has turned into an antisemitic hatefest continuing to harass Jewish students is not the answer. There is room for dialogue, there is room for peaceful protest, and there is room for change. There is a difference between a peaceful protest to endorse a cause, and cheering for terrorist groups that actively call for the elimination of Jewish students. Harassing Jewish students is not the best method to get community members to support your cause. Enough is enough.\nBEN MESSAFI is a College first year studying economics and political science from Westchester, N.Y.

          "title": "Zack Ben-Ezra | The free speech double standard",
          "article_content": "In the past week, much has been written about the Gaza Solidarity Encampment that sprung up on Penn\u2019s campus. Much has missed the point.\u00a0\nLet me be clear and unequivocal before I proceed: I strongly believe in protecting free speech, especially speech I disagree with, but that protection must be applied even handedly and is not without sensible content-neutral limitations.\u00a0\n\t\tFree speech and academic freedom are paramount to a productive university campus. A university should be a place where ideas are freely exchanged, where we encounter new ideas that make us uncomfortable, and where we ultimately grow as a community in the pursuit of some greater truth. Not everyone needs to agree, nor should they, but we must remain respectful and even-handed to ensure that ideas continue to flow, and the marketplace of ideas continues to flourish.\u00a0\nThe Penn community and its leadership has utterly failed to even handedly protect free speech on campus.\u00a0\n\t\t\n\t\nNo one has the right to set up an encampment in violation of university policy \u2014 it doesn\u2019t matter what you are protesting or on which side you are. That is a simple viewpoint-neutral time, place, and manner restriction \u2014 a \u00a0fundamental principle of our free speech jurisprudence.\u00a0\nIn his Apr. 26 university-wide email, Interim Penn President Larry Jameson himself acknowledged that the \u201cencampment itself violates the University\u2019s facilities policies\u201d and that \u201charassing and intimidating comments and actions by some of the protesters, which were reported and documented by many in our community, violate Penn\u2019s open expression guidelines and state and federal law, including Title VI of the Civil Rights Act.\u201d Jameson then ordered the encampment to disband.\n\tThat was more than a week ago, and the encampment remains active on College Green.\nIt truly perplexes me how an Ivy League institution actively being sued under Title VI can simultaneously admit that there are Title VI violations on their campus and then take no action to stop them. This is a true failure by university administration, and they deserve to be held accountable.\u00a0\nImagine a situation in which a pro-police encampment sprouted up on campus in the wake of George Floyd and the Black Lives Matter movement. Imagine that the encampment was the same size as the Gaza Solidarity Encampment and was similarly disruptive to campus life and destructive of campus property. Now ask yourself, would that pro-police encampment be tolerated to the same extent that the current encampment is? I have a hard time believing it and so should you.\u00a0\nDon\u2019t believe me? Look no further than the University\u2019s treatment of its own faculty. Professor Amy Wax is currently being investigated and threatened with sanctions for comments she made about racial and ethnic minorities. Let me be clear: I am not here to defend Wax. Her comments deserve to be investigated, and possibly sanctioned. But ask yourself, is the University\u2019s treatment of Wax being fairly applied to other faculty members? I have witnessed members of Penn faculty call for an intifada as part of on-campus protests and have seen Penn lecturer Dwayne Booth\u2019s cartoons that invoke deeply troubling antisemitic tropes. Where are the university-wide investigations into these faculty members? Where is the discussion on university sanctions against them? They are nowhere to be found.\u00a0\n\t\tGet our newsletter, DP Daybreak, delivered to your inbox every weekday morning.Penn and its leadership must work to genuinely uphold free speech and academic freedom on campus. University policy must be applied fairly and in a viewpoint-neutral manner to all members of the campus community. That means protecting speech when appropriate and restricting speech when in violation of reasonable, viewpoint-neutral policies \u2014 whether we agree or disagree with what is being said.\u00a0\nWe have the privilege of being a part of one of the most prestigious universities in the world. This is a privilege of which many of our grandparents could only dream. This privilege comes with the responsibility to engage in discourse in a fair and even-handed manner. It\u2019s about time we start living up to this privilege, and it\u2019s about time Penn\u2019s leadership and faculty started acting as role models in leading the way.\u00a0\nZACK BEN-EZRA is a second-year J.D. student at Penn Carey Law School.

          "article_content": "Guest columnist Rebecca Stein responds to Tulia Falleti's editorial addressing the billboard trucks on campus.Dear Tulia,\nIt saddens me that you chose the return of the billboards as the focus of your concern related to the encampment on College Green. You state that they are part of an external, political campaign against higher education, but I see them as a comfort that I am not alone here at Penn.\n\t\tSince the encampment has gone up, I spend every lunch break in counterprotest. I have my lunch outside the library where I work, with my Bring Them Home Now T-shirt and an Israeli flag. I am there to show Jewish students that they are not alone and to remind the community that the history of the Jewish people is complex, that words matter, and that shouting slogans does not move us to a peaceful resolution; neither at Penn, nor in the Middle East.\nYou write that the students participating in the encampment are \u201cbrilliant and caring.\u201d But I beg to differ: If they were caring, they would not shout \u201cintifada revolution.\u201d They would ask me about my personal experience during the intifada and about my friend\u2019s father, who spent his last 15 years as a quadriplegic after a suicide attack carried out during the first intifada.\n\t\t\n\t\nThe student that held up a sign reading \u201cZionism is racism\u201d is not brilliant. Judaism is both a faith and a nationhood. But it is not a race. There are plenty of Jews of every race living in Israel. These brilliant students would do better listening more and shouting less.\nAnd finally, you write that \u201cwe are a city of Brotherly Love.\u201d But this too seems off. A mother asked me, \u201cWhy are you standing here all alone? There are a thousand Jewish students on campus. Why are they not standing with you?\u201d I asked her why only the Jewish students are required to stand up for the hostages and for the right of Jews for nationhood.

          "title": "Faresi Alfaresi | Stop invoking the \u2018violent, raging, Arab\u2019 stereotype",
          "article_content": "I am an international student from Kuwait \u2014 but many assume that I am American upon first meeting me. I have an American accent, tattoos, piercings, and no particular explicit indication of my identity as an Arab man; I do not wear a necklace in Arabic, and I have never worn Arab cultural attire around campus. So, why is it that I constantly have an opinion thrust upon me regarding campus protests and Israel-Palestine as a whole?\nPlease do not misunderstand me as selfishly complaining or not wanting to engage in political discourse. I bring this to light to convey that even I, as relatively non-Arab presenting as I am, have not been spared the Penn community\u2019s blatant and upsetting racial profiling. I have lost count of how many individuals \u2014 ranging from peers to distant acquaintances to strangers \u2014 that I have met who assumed my position on the Israel-Palestine conflict or that I was even Muslim since the escalation on Oct. 7.\n\t\tOf course, it is arguably normal for an individual to make harmless assumptions based on observations. But the issue arises when these assumptions, as often occurs at Penn, become the basis for stereotypical and hateful rhetoric. I study Hebrew at Penn, and other students have always asked me if I feel \u201cangry\u201d or \u201cupset\u201d in class when a discussion centering around Israel or Zionism arises. And therein lies one of the issues: Arab students such as myself are not asked for their positions nor given the benefit of the doubt. We are immediately thrust into a position of aggressive anger and discontent that we never even communicated nor chose ourselves. The notion of the \u2018angry Arab\u2019 is rooted in imperial and colonialist mindsets, and perhaps more salient is the distortion of Arab students\u2019 words and intentions \u2014 a concept reminiscent of the West\u2019s initial misconstruing of Edward Said\u2019s writings.\u00a0\nI have also found minuscule and dwindling support from the Hebrew department during my studies, with my only alternative to finishing my major requirement \u2014 besides a language class that cannot fit my schedule \u2014 being a class revolving around Israeli culture. I cannot help but think of the Penn community's outrage had I been a white and/or Jewish student not being supported in their Arabic studies and forced to take a class around Palestinian culture. To be crystal clear, I would not condone the aforementioned happening to any Jewish student, nor do I condone the alleged forceful attendance of Jewish students to the Palestine Writes Literature Festival for their class. A university as well endowed and progressive as Penn can and should provide ample support and resources to both communities; it would be a grave injustice otherwise. But whilst Jewish students who express their fears garnered earned and necessary support from the University, and even testified at Congress, here I am explicitly expressing my concerns for the safety of myself and other Arab students in another column due to the shameful lack of support.\u00a0\n\t\t\t\tSEE MORE FROM \ufeffFARESI ALFARESI:Penn must not succumb to post-9/11 hysterics and anti-Arab rhetoricDespite all of these concerns, including the ones voiced in my previous column and the data from the survey I have collected, Penn fails to shed light on the concerns and fears of the Arab community. The Jewish community had the antisemitism task force established as far back as November, and the Arab community received the scraps of a generalized \u201ccommission against hate\u201d; I implore us all, regardless of political views and association, to ask why antisemitism is allowed to have the word \u201ctask force\u201d attached to it while anti-Arab hate and Islamophobia does not get the same explicit word? Is this not a clear inequality on the administration\u2019s end? And it is not a matter of semantics, as the explicitness of the antisemitism task force conveys its \u2014 rightful and valid \u2014 importance whilst the generalized \u201ccommission against hate\u201d fails to even include the word \u201cArab\u201d and/or \u201cMuslim\u201d in it, let alone convey the same sense of urgency and action.\u00a0\nThe lack of equal task force establishment, both in speed of establishment and in title, is not the only thing that further divides the struggling communities at Penn. The absolute disregard that interim President Larry Jameson and the Penn administration had for Ramadan and Eid is appalling and indescribably discriminatory; not acknowledging these major religious holidays for a community that is already underrepresented and discriminated against during these trying times communicates one thing: that Arab and Muslim students do not matter.\n\tThis is only exemplified by the fact that less than a week after Eid, an email was sent out that mentioned Passover and the safety of Jewish students in light of encampments. This does not help support or heal the Jewish nor Arab students but rather continues to widen the chasm that our previous president left behind. Are Arab and Muslim students not equally worthy of safety from potential collateral damage caused by protesting? Are Arab and Muslim holidays not worthy of any mention at all? In fact, just as early as May 1, students suffered a chemical attack while security waited before intervention, and the administration has not acknowledged this matter with the urgency the encampment was addressed with. Comments circulated on The Daily Pennsylvanian\u2019s Instagram coverage mocking the individuals and trivializing the attack by claiming the agent was \u201cfart spray,\u201d and a counter-protestor was caught with two knives and walked off with only a citation.\u00a0\nEven more vitriolic and direct hate-speech that weaponizes the \u2018terrorist\u2019 rhetoric was espoused by alleged Penn community members towards Arab students on May 5; protestors at the encampment were awoken with a mocking of the Muslim call to prayer and were directly called \u201cterrorists,\u201d a blatant Islamophobic and anti-Arab notion that harms community members not involved in the encampment and protests. None of the aforementioned has been addressed by Jameson in his volley of emails, further proving Penn\u2019s lack of support for Muslim and Arab students. Again, I cannot help but think of the Penn community's outrage had this happened to any of the pro-Israel counter-protestors who were also exercising their First Amendment rights.\nI have heard the concerns and fears of my Jewish peers, and I am hurt by the thought that students within the mainstream Jewish community have to feel fearful no matter the reason or tangible validity of it. I have attended different seders over Passover, I have co-hosted dialogues to foster understanding, and I will continue to do so and grow my understanding and empathy. But I have mostly been asked if my friends and I \u2014 as Arab individuals\u00a0\u2014\u00a0fear daily life on campus by Arab professors and by friends abroad, rarely by other groups of individuals. So, as a closing note, I beseech all readers to check in on and comfort your Arab peers \u2014 and when their fears and sorrow transform into anger and action, consider all that they have endured and the absolute lack of support before labeling their anger and emotionality as \u2018irrational, \u2018scary,\u2019 and \u2018violent.\u2019\nFARESI ALFARESI is a College junior studying political science and modern Middle Eastern studies from Kuwait.

          "title": "Eyal Yakoby | The mischaracterization of the encampment is dangerous to the Penn community",
          "article_content": "University leadership correctly recognized that the recent encampment protest placed many members of the Penn community \u201cunder threat.\u201d Reading now how the story is trying to be twisted through mental gymnastics is dangerous, not only to the community members who have been under threat but also to the students who are being led to believe that breaking the law is acceptable. Reading statements from the Penn chapter of the American Association of University Professors throughout the year \u2014 as well as their press conference that paid so much attention to the police who cleared the encampment, and no attention to how we got there \u2014 is a remarkable interpretation of the facts of the case, and especially breathtaking from scholars who claim to have expertise in critical thinking. Professors, to me, are individuals whom students should look up to as those who search for the truth. But, reading statement after statement throughout the year, disappointingly, it seems that the truth for AAUP-Penn is full of misstatements and highly biased interpretations.\u00a0\nAAUP-Penn released a statement on May 10, describing the university\u2019s actions in shutting down the encampment as a \u201cViolation of the University\u2019s Guidelines on Open Expression and a cowardly, shameful attempt to silence and punish speech that administrators simply do not want to hear.\u201d On the grounds of open expression, the university is well within its guidelines to remove the encampment, and the argument that it is not is simply unfounded.\n\t\tThe concerning actions of the protestors have nothing to do with free speech. It was the conduct of the encampment that was the central issue. \u201cHomemade weapons\u201d were found at the encampment. A student was surrounded by four masked individuals flashing strobe lights in his eyes and making threats. Documents were found circulating within the encampment on \u201cinstructions for escalating\u2013including through building occupations and violence.\u201d The Benjamin Franklin statue on College Green was vandalized numerous times, and one of those times, the incident is being investigated as a \u201chate crime.\u201d The Penn Police crime logs even include \u201cterroristic threats\u201d at the encampment site. The non-Penn-affiliated members of the encampment were committing illegal trespass. None of these actions have anything to do with free speech.\u00a0\nIn addition, it is important that the right to free speech itself is not without limits, and few constitutional legal experts have claimed otherwise. I would contend that the waving of the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine flag, a United States Department of State-designated terrorist organization, while simultaneously chanting \u201cAl Qassam, make us proud,\u201d (referring to another recognized terrorist group that has committed countless atrocities) are actions that have no place on college campuses. These are examples of hate speech that incites violence. It is troubling that professors are encouraging this to continue and trying to misrepresent that reality.\u00a0\n\t\t\t\tSEE MORE FROM EYAL YAKOBY:Speaking louder than before: Penn's second chance to reject antisemitismHow the BDS movement impedes discussion and espouses antisemitism\ufeffPolitical science professor Anne Norton tweeted \u201cOur students remained peaceful at every point. Even the administration does not dispute that.\u201d Yet, the administration could not have been clearer when they said, \u201cEvery day the encampment exists, the campus is less safe. Some have aimed to characterize this as a peaceful protest. It is not.\u201d\u00a0\nPhilosophy professor Sukaina Hirji stated during the AAUP-Penn press conference that to her, \u201cSeeing hundreds of cops in riot gear arrest students and faculty sends to me, and to my students and to all of us, a very clear message about what conversations are and are not allowed on Penn's campus going forward.\u201d But when you look at the police records, only nine out of 33 of those arrested were students. So, the argument that students were driving the protest is simply false. To me, every time I walked past the encampment, it was fairly clear that a super minority of the encampment seemed even the age of a college student. And again, claiming this is about \u201cconversations\u201d avoids the issues of conduct entirely.\n\tAnother professor, Sarah Jackson, stated that the University\u2019s messaging was \u201cveering dangerously towards propaganda.\u201d She described the encampment as a space for, \u201ceducation, debate, community, and politics.\u201d This simply is not true. The encampment consistently did not allow anyone whom they deemed as \u00a0\u201cZionist\u201d to enter the encampment. A CNN reporter even showed how few of the protestors engaged with him. From my understanding, debate is difficult when you do not even want people with opposing views to be near you. Chabad Rabbi Levi Haskelevich was even physically blocked from entering the encampment, but somehow there is no condemnation of this behavior by the AAUP-Penn\u2019s press conference. Her defense of the protestors was that the students were \u201cgenuinely trying to learn.\u201d What is mind-boggling to me is that the entire University is set up for students to learn. There is no need, especially at a university, to set up an encampment in the heart of campus when there is ample infrastructure to educate students.\nElliot and Roslyn Jaffe Endowed Professor in Film Studies Karen Redrobe made a similar point. She stated that Penn has an obligation to \u201cprotect academic freedom and the free exchange of ideas.\u201d She continued, according to The Daily Pennsylvanian, to compare what Penn did to fascist governments in the 1930s to eliminate free speech. To compare Penn breaking up an unlawful encampment, after countless warnings, to Nazi Germany\u2019s actions is appalling and disingenuous. In Nazi Germany, the fascist government passed the \u201cLaw for the Restoration of the Professional Civil Service\u201d in 1933, firing and barring the vast majority of Jewish professors. They then proceeded to pass the \u201cLaw Against Overcrowding in Schools and Universities\u201d to remove Jewish students to \u201cAryanize\u201d the university. This bears little resemblance to the removal of an encampment on the grounds of a violation of Penn\u2019s policy, state law, and federal law.\nThen there was Arabic literature professor Huda Fakhreddine who described Penn\u2019s response as \u201cshameful behavior\u201d and what she described as an ongoing \u201cattack\u201d on pro-Palestinian voices. Yet, Fakhreddeine herself posted on X, the platform formerly known as Twitter, describing faculty members who went to Israel as \u201cinsolent, depraved, and morally bankrupt.\u201d It seems as though it is not the University that is attacking pro-Palestinian voices, but her who is attacking pro-Israel voices. Once more, she described the administration's actions as shameful behavior but failed to mention the illegal behavior of the encampment.\u00a0\nIt is disappointing how faculty are encouraging the unlawful and unjust behavior of the protestors. It is their encouragement that led to protests surrounding the President\u2019s House, with some even entering the house\u2019s gates. That is what shameful behavior is: getting a mob of people to target someone\u2019s house. But these professors would never report on that because it is that very behavior that is encouraged by the statement they put out. What is most troubling is that it is the students who will ultimately have criminal records as a result of this encouragement. Moreover, if their ultimate goal is to help the Palestinian cause, they should look to productive means of peace and security for both Israelis and Palestinians. This unlawful behavior distracts from what is important. Instead of defending and encouraging the behavior, they should distance themselves from it. I believe in debate and free speech; what I find problematic is the mischaracterization of reality which further puts students in harm's way.\nEYAL YAKOBY is a College senior studying political science and modern Middle East studies.

          "title": "Imran Siddiqui | Finding your space",
          "article_content": "My time at The Daily Pennsylvanian taught me an important lesson about the communities we\u2019re a part of and why we pour so much of ourselves into the spaces we inhabit. I originally joined the organization during my first semester at Penn, hoping to surround myself with like-minded people while my classmates were all scattered across the globe due to the pandemic. Four years later, I now know that in addition to managing classes, work, and other commitments, we must be intentional about immersing ourselves in spaces that help us grow and be a positive force for change.\nWhen I joined the DP, I thought that this was the place where I could do just that. I saw the impact of my words, and I am grateful for the opportunity to amplify stories from students and local activists about police violence, Penn\u2019s culpability in the underfunding of local public schools, and the University\u2019s role in the displacement of long-time Philadelphians.\n\t\tThe people I spoke with for these articles embodied this positive change that I wanted to make. Simultaneously, however, I also began to learn more about how the DP can cause harm. Other columnists have explored the DP\u2019s exclusionary history and how the problems we see today are often the result of poor representation or access. Spearheaded by the recently created Diversity Committee, the DP\u2019s 2023 demographics report highlights the underrepresentation of Black and Hispanic students within the DP when compared to Penn\u2019s undergraduate population, the low level of participation among Muslim students, and the disparity between the percentage of first-generation, low-income students on the company\u2019s board versus those just on the staff.\nI began to understand that these discrepancies do not just \u201chappen.\u201d Rather, they are the consequences of poor-quality coverage or editorial ignorance directed at these communities over time, coupled by the institutional barriers and apprehension that many marginalized groups feel toward the DP.\u00a0\n\t\t\n\t\nGiven these factors, why did I commit so much of my college experience to the DP?\u00a0\nI believe that we have a duty to leave the world better than we found it. I saw the importance and potential of the DP, and I wanted to be a part of the process to rebuild relationships with these communities the DP has neglected. Disappointed by the knowledge of the harm caused by previous editorial coverage and internal decisions, I put everything I had into my work at the DP, aiming to leverage the organization\u2019s platform to create a more equitable environment for journalists to come.\n\tEven at the end of my tenure as editor-in-chief, I know the DP remains imperfect, and there is so much more work to be done. At the same time, I know it is important to recognize and commend the good work that my team accomplished last year. I am proud of the news department\u2019s intrepid coverage of labor organizing and Penn\u2019s alleged union-busting tactics, the first staff editorials being published since 2021 thanks to the opinion department, and the growth of the @dailypennsports Instagram account supported by the collaboration between the sports, multimedia, and social media departments.\nMore than any of that, I am proud of the intentionality and thoroughness that went into every piece of content we published. As the person who fielded suggestions, feedback, and criticism from fellow Penn community members, alumni, and other stakeholders, I understand people\u2019s frustrations and concerns. There is still a lot that can be improved, but I can confidently say that the staff approached each day with a desire to do better than the day before.\nMy time at the DP has given me the privilege to learn so much about different niches across the University. The problems I see within the DP are far from unique to just one organization: they are emblematic of the issues that exist within the wider Penn community. At a campus that has historically housed one of the most depressed student bodies across the country, being intentional about creating spaces centered in care and justice becomes even more vital.\u00a0\nAs I prepare to leave Penn and I reflect on how resources and spaces are distributed across campus, the inequities become strikingly noticeable. For decades, students have advocated for diversifying Locust Walk \u2014 arguing that this main fixture of Penn does a disservice to the diversity that exists across the University due to the prevalence of administrative and fraternity buildings. The first major changes to Locust Walk in 1973 were a result of collective action when students and other community members occupied College Hall for four days to protest a series of rapes on campus, eventually leading to the creation of the Penn Women\u2019s Center.\u00a0\nChange doesn\u2019t stop there, though. We can see these same conversations happening today when looking at cultural centers\u2019 continued requests for more space on campus. After being located in the basement of ARCH for years, the University finally dedicated the entire building to the cultural resource centers last school year \u2014 even though the leaders of Penn\u2019s main minority coalition groups have repeatedly asked for their own buildings on Locust Walk to ensure students from marginalized backgrounds feel embraced and empowered on campus.\nThese conversations are also exemplified by the work of students protesting Penn\u2019s response to the ongoing genocide in Gaza. Student protesters and organizations like uPAO (formerly known as Penn Against the Occupation), Freedom School for Palestine, and Penn Faculty for Justice in Palestine established an encampment and created a space where Palestinian students feel heard at a university that remains complicit in the genocide of an entire state. They have shown us what it means to take up space to raise awareness and make positive change.\nAside from organizers\u2019 primary demands surrounding the disclosure of Penn\u2019s financial holdings and the divestment from corporations that profit from Israel\u2019s occupation of Palestine, they also urge administrators to support the creation of an independent Middle Eastern cultural center at Penn. Although the importance of a cultural space pales in comparison to the tragedy occurring each day in Gaza, it is an important part of how we think about repurposing space more equitably on a campus where Muslim and Arab students often feel overlooked and isolated. Organizing around a shared vision of a more just future allows us to reach new potentials.\n\t\tGet our newsletter, DP Daybreak, delivered to your inbox every weekday morning.At the end of my tenure as editor-in-chief last December, I could not help but be scared of letting go of something that I put so much time and effort into \u2014 not knowing if any of the positive changes I pushed for would outlast my one year at the paper\u2019s helm. At the same time, I recognized that I had to trust that there will continue to be students who care about pushing the DP forward and leveraging the space we already take up for justice. Despite my initial fears, I must be confident that the DP can be used for good \u2014 just like the tireless student journalists who paved the way for me have believed.\nMoving forward, we must continue to be intentional about the spaces we are a part of and think more deeply about how we can improve them. Whether this be on campus \u2014 ensuring our clubs and our university reflect the values we hold important \u2014 or in the places we go once we leave Penn, I urge all of us to reimagine a more just society and put the work into demanding progress.\u00a0\nIMRAN SIDDIQUI is a College senior studying political science from Grosse Pointe Park, Mich.

          "title": "Eashwar Kantemneni | Keeping an open mind",
          "article_content": "I have been a die-hard sports fan for as long as I can remember. Growing up, I was glued to my TV as I watched the Cavs and Warriors battle back-and-forth for four years straight in the NBA Finals, the Buckeyes destroyed that team up north every November for eight years straight (that will resume this fall), and my Bengals sadly following-up promising regular seasons with devastating playoff losses (thankfully that has changed). I would spend countless hours sharpening my sports knowledge and opinions through watching \"First Take\" and \"Undisputed,\" or reading practically every article on ESPN.\nDespite my strong following of sports and sports media, though, I never once saw myself in journalism, even as a hobby. My high school had a well-established newspaper with a sports section. Yet, I never once had the interest to write an article during my four years. I never really enjoyed writing in general, so I thought to myself, \u201cWhy would I spend my free time doing that?\u201d\n\t\tIn my first semester at Penn, I attended the virtual club fair and came across The Daily Pennsylvanian\u2019s Only Section That Matters (DPOSTM). I had learned about and admired the DP\u2019s importance at Penn before I even started college. While journalism still was not my interest, I thought I would keep an open mind and joined DPOSTM thinking it would at least be a good way to make some new friends with similar interests and limit my boredom from COVID-19 lockdowns. I still remember spending a whole day going through the online archives for individual game recaps for my first-ever story on Penn\u2019s 2012 football Ivy Title and the excitement I got after seeing it published online. Still, my first year at DPOSTM was relatively uneventful. I struggled to consistently write stories while balancing a loaded schedule of pre-med requirements. I never thought that the DP would soon after turn out to become an integral part of my Penn experience.\nAfter not being involved during the summer, I got an email right before the school year about becoming an associate editor. I filled out the form not expecting to get picked, as many of the clubs I had applied to at Penn ended in rejection before. However, when I got the email saying I was accepted, I was pleasantly surprised and eager to start. During my first associate shift, I felt uneasy not having met anyone from DPOSTM in person yet. Once I entered the office, though, I felt relaxed and in awe seeing all the old newspapers and posters tacked on the wall, thinking I could leave something of my own there one day. Though I had just met Brandon, Lochlahn, Joey, and Nicky, I quickly felt I was a part of their and the larger DPOSTM community. We would spend shifts talking about our NFL teams or watching random basketball games on the monitors. Their love for sports writing quickly spread to me, and I went from having written about six stories up until then to matching that total in just one week. Moreover, I began to get involved with DPOSTM outside of Wednesday shifts by attending the weekly meetings and going on road trips to cover Penn football games at Columbia and Harvard University.\n\t\t\t\tSEE MORE FROM \ufeffEASHWAR KANTEMNENI:Men's Rookie of the Year: Malachi HosleyPenn men's basketball loses fourth straight conference game in 70-61 loss to Brown?\nThat semester motivated me to eventually run for and become an editor in 2022. Initially, the responsibilities felt daunting. The long shifts on Sunday afternoons and Tuesday and Wednesday nights sounded annoying, but those concerns quickly washed away. Working with Matt to help lead the department was a great experience. He seemed like he was somehow always in control of the operation, and I did my best to help out in any way I could. Being in the office consistently allowed me to get to know and have fun conversations with people around the DP: like Caleb, Sophie, Allyson, Anna, Jonah, Asaad, Derek, and many more. Soon, they all began showing up for our weekly sports meetings and BYOs, and we ended our term with DPOSTM more integrated into the DP than ever before. The sports office also became the hub which I based my schedule around, and the editing shifts and weekly meetings became some of the highlights of my week. I even put in a few extra hours to perfect some PIG shots before we played every Sunday shift.\n\t?\nWhat I will undoubtedly remember most about DPOSTM though are covering games and the road trips we took. A few of my favorites include Matt and I convincing AComm (Penn Athletic Communications) to give us press passes to cover the March Madness games that Penn was hosting at the 76ers stadium; Brandon driving us eight hours up to Dartmouth (with a convenient excursion to explore the Connecticut State Capitol on the way) to cover Penn football\u2019s massive upset victory over the Big Green (which I predicted in the car ride there), and staying at a scary-looking farm in northern New Hampshire, only for it to be one of the most beautiful nature scenes in the morning; subbing in as an on-field photographer for Penn football\u2019s last-second comeback victory over Princeton; and driving through New York City for the first time in a thunderstorm on the way to Yale. Traveling all around the Northeast and the fun experiences I had with the people that I did not have space to mention are some of my best experiences at Penn, and I will always remember them.\n\nHad you told me before I started college that joining a student newspaper would be my biggest extracurricular activity, I would never have believed it. But after these last four years, I am thankful and proud that that is the case. As I move forward with life, I will always make sure that I keep an open mind when trying new things, with the hopes it will end up a similarly great experience like DPOSTM. \u00a0\u00a0\nEASHWAR KANTEMNENI is a College senior studying neuroscience from Cincinnati.

          "article_content": "I have loved spending my past three years as a part of The Daily Pennsylvanian more than words can properly capture. It has almost destroyed me more than once.\nThe DP has given me multiple panic attacks and lost me full nights of sleep. I\u2019m probably still recovering from the temporary insanity of spending countless hours in that windowless office at 40th and Walnut streets. And the thing is, for someone who\u2019s served two consecutive years on the company\u2019s executive board, all of this is par for the course.\n\t\tWe\u2019re a real newsroom, and newsrooms are really stressful places. The difference is that our little media company is built on college students \u2014 still kids, in many ways \u2014 managing other college students.\u00a0\nIf you\u2019re anything like me, you have a love-hate relationship with the DP\u2019s ceaseless, internal politicking and gossip. Some days, it has made me feel like Machiavelli, and on others, like I need to pull a \u201cMy Year of Rest and Relaxation.\u201d Whether exhausting (often) or exhilarating (rarely), DP drama is never not a massive time suck. Every year, like clockwork, comes the inevitable board memo about how we all need to do less of it; anyone who can solve that will be the greatest editor in our 140-year history.\n\t\t\n\t\nBut let\u2019s take it as a given that it can\u2019t be solved, and why would we want to anyway? My culturally Jewish heritage has given me an appreciation for the sacred art of the kvetch, the vent, complaining for complaining\u2019s sake. It\u2019s what lets us blow off steam and then get back to doing our jobs.\u00a0\nNominally, those jobs are \u201ceditor\u201d or \u201cmanager,\u201d but when you break it down, they\u2019re all the same thing: teacher, mentor, sensei, mafia boss. If our staffers don\u2019t know how to do their jobs, there\u2019s no way for us to do ours, and hopefully, if we teach at least one well enough, they will eventually be able to destroy us and assume our place.\u00a0\n\tAt this year\u2019s annual DP Banquet, I gave a toast to our 139th board president, Jesse Zhang, where I said something to the effect of \u201cevery board position is a service position, and the higher up on the org chart you go, the truer that is.\u201d Yet, some of the best teachers I knew during my time as a 34th Street writer \u2014 Denali Sagner or Kyle Whiting or Aakruti Ganeshan \u2014 were the ones who never ran for Street\u2019s executive board at all. They never let the climb get in the way of the work.\u00a0\nThe drama gets especially bad around elections season every November. Hushed conversations happen behind locked doors; friendships either begin to crack or implode all at once; the committee schemes while the hopefuls endlessly speculate. Remember, all these kids got into an Ivy League school. It\u2019s easy to believe that the board position you do or don\u2019t get will determine the rest of your life, or at least your time in college. It won\u2019t. But I\u2019ve been guilty of this line of thought myself, and I\u2019m grateful I never had to learn the lesson the hard way. I can admit that much.\nIn a way, I have the most respect for the people who were on board as sophomores and didn\u2019t run a second time; who got in, did what they were there to do, and got out. I think of someone like Hannah Gross, the 137th board assignments editor, whose path only crossed with mine a couple of times. We met once when she was back in the office, doing interviews for a story she was writing about the company culture. She didn\u2019t seem burned out, or like she was missing out on something. She looked happy.\nAllow me to clarify: I do not regret a single moment I spent at the DP. Without the scheming, I\u2019d be at least a few friends shorter (y\u2019all know who you are) and without the panic attacks, there would be no glossy mag to speak of today. I cherish every single person who has taught me so much \u2014 Bea, Emily, Arielle, Christine, and Katherine \u2014 and the, dare I say, prot\u00e9g\u00e9s I\u2019ve seen come up under my wing \u2014 Natalia, Norah, Sophia, Hannah, Catherine, Kate, the list goes on. I\u2019m honored to have played even the smallest part in their growth as writers and, now, as teachers themselves.\nAs Street editor-in-chief, I made my name and brand on an encyclopedic knowledge of pop culture references. So before I depart this mortal coil for good, how about one more for the road. In the sixth season of the NBC sitcom \u201cParks and Recreation,\u201d my lookalike Ben Wyatt gets laid off from his job and has no idea what to do with himself. Hmm, I wonder what that must be like.\nHe invents an absurdly complicated board game called The Cones of Dunshire: \u201c8-12 players, two wizards, a maverick, the arbiter, two warriors, a corporal, and a ledgerman.\u201d Sounds roughly like the DP company structure to me. As a former competitive Magic: The Gathering player and part-time Dungeons & Dragons aficionado, this is pretty much my love language.\nTwo seasons later, the Cones come back. Ben plays against the executives of made-up tech company Gryzzl to fight for free WiFi in his town of Pawnee, Ind. Just as it seems he\u2019s on the precipice of defeat (\u201clooks like someone\u2019s out of resource gems\u201d), Ben grins, then has a knowing chuckle: \u201cYou made one crucial mistake: you forgot about the essence of the game. It\u2019s about the cones.\u201d\n\t\tGet our newsletter, DP Daybreak, delivered to your inbox every weekday morning.The cones are the writers, of course.

          "title": "Julia Fischer | Fact-check: \u2018Curiosity killed the cat\u2019",
          "article_content": "When I say that I\u2019m a double major and double minor, it sounds like a carefully planned achievement. But what truly brings me joy is not the accomplishment that\u2019ll go on my transcript. It\u2019s what I explain after listing my areas of study: that they came about because I went where curiosity led me.\nStarting college during the COVID-19 pandemic, the most concrete part of my experience was the academics. During those first two semesters, half of my classes were made up of the Integrated Studies Program, a requirement for Benjamin Franklin Scholars in the College of Arts and Sciences. What this really meant was that in the fall, we dissected Homer\u2019s \u201cIliad\u201d in classical studies while reading Erasmus in history. The next semester, we learned about behavior in positive psychology while attempting Jain vegetarianism as part of religious studies. More than specific topics, however, what BFS really taught me is that when it comes to separate disciplines, overlap \u2014 integration \u2014 matters more than difference.\n\t\tFrom there, the rest is history. My time in BFS cemented my decision to major in both Hispanic studies and political science. Post-ISP, I was required to take three BFS seminars. After my first, on Shakespeare, I fell in love with English and decided to complete the minor. And when I stumbled upon global medieval studies at the end of my junior year, I quickly added that minor, too.\nNone of these important academic choices were particularly strategic. I didn\u2019t take on any of my majors and minors because I thought they\u2019d look great on my transcript or help me professionally, but they\u2019ve taught me so much. They represent what college is really about: exploration. Throughout my Penn experience, my main goal has been to learn but never to force myself to be interested in areas I didn\u2019t feel genuinely curious about \u2014 at least, not beyond giving them the \u201cold college try.\u201d\u00a0\n\t\t\n\t\nTo any and all undergraduates reading, please delve into the interests you didn\u2019t have the opportunity to pursue in high school \u2014 and even if you\u2019re an upperclassman, the ones that you feel are being sparked now. Allow curiosity, not just perceived usefulness or resume bling, to dictate how you spend your time. Let it lead you both within and beyond the classroom. Spend six-plus hours per week in Charles Addams Fine Arts Hall for a drawing class. Visit Van Pelt Library and borrow more books, across genres, than you can hope to finish in an academic year. Attend talks, performances, concerts, and movies both on and off campus. Walk around inside of museums and outside in Philadelphia. And apply to work for the student newspaper \u2014 especially if, like I did, you have no prior experience.\nAs anyone who works for The Daily Pennsylvanian knows, curiosity is central to journalism. As a writer for 34th Street this year, it inspired me to cover an array of topics, from niche musical genres to public libraries. For the copy department, curiosity is uniquely crucial. In the Red Room \u2014 copy\u2019s headquarters \u2014 curiosity is expanded and focused on every single detail. A copy editor\u2019s job isn\u2019t just about fixing grammar, spelling, and style; it\u2019s also about fact-checking every statement an article makes. Often, it means dozens of open tabs, and a seven-year-old laptop\u2019s fans running louder than a jet engine (fact-checked, yes, this might be an exaggeration).\n\tCopy-editing can be exhausting. But more often, it\u2019s exhilarating. Nowhere else can I say that I\u2019ve worked on a basketball recap one minute and breaking news the next. I\u2019ve learned so much about campus happenings and culture thanks to copy. And it\u2019s also fundamentally important to publications like the DP. Professionalism, integrity, and the trust of readers rely as much on those behind the scenes as those listed in bylines. In a world where it\u2019s easier than ever to encounter misinformation, copy-editing is a service to truth-telling that\u2019s more essential than ever. And I\u2019m so proud to have been a part of it.\nTo those reading, stay informed. The fact that you\u2019re reading the DP is a great sign. Thank you for supporting student journalism. But don\u2019t allow yourself to be limited in your sources. Never be satisfied with a headline or with a single article. Click on the links your news outlets cite and venture beyond them. Fact-check where you\u2019re doubtful, and even where you\u2019re not. Read across the political spectrum. Question your own assumptions, and those any writer or editor might make \u2014 for all our hard work, journalists are still human.\nAs I wrap up, I\u2019m reminded of the many people I\u2019m grateful for. Like any good editor, I\u2019ll keep it concise. Thank you to Brittany and Sophie, my predecessors, for all your dedication and encouragement. Thank you to Allyson, for being the best co-copy editor and fellow Philadelphia sports fan. Thank you to everyone who made the Red Room warm, filled with laughter and inside jokes.

          "title": "Jesse Zhang | Cheers to never having it 'normal'",
          "article_content": "I remember the day I was admitted to Penn like it was yesterday (off the waitlist, I might add). I was home in China due to the COVID-19 pandemic, and it was four days before my high school graduation on Zoom. I breathed a sigh of relief as the sense of certainty settled in: I was finally going to have a normal college experience.But who was I kidding? My friends and I were graduating from living rooms, cars, and socially-distanced football fields. People took to the streets around the world to advocate for racial justice. And the 2020 United States presidential election, one that was as long as it was mentally tormenting, was in full swing. We all yearned for normalcy, but nothing about our lives was normal.While I had to begin my first year at Penn from my bedroom in China, I was determined to not let it diminish my experience. As such, over a Zoom meeting, I joined The Daily Pennsylvanian\u2019s multimedia department. As a staffer, I took photos in corners of my world that had any miniscule resemblance to the writers\u2019 experience in America. My first big assignment came when former photo editor Sukhmani Kaur asked me to stay up all night and edit photos as they rolled in on Election Day. What kind of first year gives up a night of sleep for a little club assignment? Not normal.Though my journey at the DP started with me completing one assignment every two weeks, I would have never foreseen how it would come to define my time at Penn.Being photo editor in 2022 allowed me to further see Penn through my camera lens. I skipped classes and meals to follow former Penn President Liz Magill to all corners of campus during the first 100 days of her tenure. I negotiated with the Secret Service to allow our own photography equipment into a campaign event with President Joe Biden and former President Barack Obama. I drove a group of photographers home at 4 a.m. after Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro and Dr. Mehmet Oz\u2019s respective election night parties. Normal? Hardly.As president in 2023, I would go on to sign my name on the dotted line and initiate the purchase of a permanent home for the DP. Our team weathered a pivotal chapter in Penn\u2019s history which culminated in the resignation of University leaders. In those months, I woke up to dozens of hate emails in my inbox every day, and our reporters worked around the clock to keep up with national news organizations which possessed more manpower and resources.\u00a0One of the copy editors on the 139th board, Allyson Nelson, quipped of the news cycle at Penn as \u201cwhen it rains, it pours.\u201d As fun (and often exhausting) as it was to spend an ungodly amount of time in our infamously windowless office and eat countless Zesto\u2019s pizzas, I also realized how abnormal of a collegiate experience it was. I was missing out on weeknight hangouts with friends, happy hours during restaurant week, formals, parties, and other archetypes of a \u201cnormal\u201d college experience. For the first two and a half of my three in-person years, my friends have considerately learned to not schedule dinners with me on weeknights.Not normal! (Shoutout to my friends for putting up with me).Though as time went on, I grew to love the abnormality. Reporting taught me how to work with tight deadlines and competing priorities. Photographing protests showed me the importance of connecting with different communities. Leading a team through crises challenged my empathy, grit, and social consciousness. The abnormality presented me with a unique skill set and undoubtedly shaped my character. Above all, I loved how it strengthened my optimism and resilience.Or maybe it\u2019s because I loved giving people ridiculous reasons on why I cannot make lunch: \u201cI HAVE TO go to the airport and photograph Air Force One.\u201dI am acutely aware of the fact that my sense of abnormality is not unique. In many ways, the normalcy the Class of 2024 yearned for at the start of our college years never arrived. While we no longer have to wear masks in classrooms or get swabbed twice a week in a giant air-ventilated tent, we are in the midst of another pivotal U.S. presidential election. We are having unprecedented discussions regarding First Amendment rights on college campuses, and our communities are feeling the inevitable ripples of conflicts across the world.Rather than letting these challenges loom over our impending graduation, we should consider the opportunities that they present. We are uniquely positioned to speak out about issues close to our hearts, have constructive conversations on the most contentious topics of the day, and act to improve the community around us.While the COVID-19 pandemic put in-person socializing on hold, we learned how to forge connections and friendships through screens. We saw the importance of becoming more self-educated and practicing our civic duties during the Black Lives Matter movement and the 2020 elections. Not since the civil rights movement and Vietnam anti-war protests of the 1960s has so much media attention been dedicated to college campuses across the country, and we must use what we learned from the abnormality of our college experience to rise up to the challenge.Between our myriads of farewell toasts, I realize that what began as a quest for normalcy evolved into an embrace of abnormality. Our college graduation is hardly the ultimate epilogue; it is merely the cliffhanger to the rest of our lives. The abnormality we saw throughout our time in college will undoubtedly change the ways in which we can and will approach the world. So in all the ways we are celebrating the Class of 2024 this graduation season, here\u2019s cheers to the abnormality that made us one of a kind.JESSE ZHANG is a Wharton senior studying business economics and public policy and marketing from Shenzhen, China.

          "title": "Esther Lim | Dear sports",
          "article_content": "I remember when I first watched your white net snap taut from a goal scored. Seeing the plus one on the scoreboard felt just like that rush I feel when the music is perfect and I row into top gear. I knew I\u2019d return for the next few matches at home. Even when the evening trains would rumble across the bridge behind Rhodes Field, and their terrific chug would drown out announcements of player substitutions that I really needed to hear, I was delighted I was the one to be there \u2014 soles suctioned to metal bleachers, fingers chilled stiff, and eardrums blitzed by bursts of crowd noise \u2014 to witness and write about it all.\nI loved my postgame sprints across the field to the home bench, holding two phones on record just in case one wouldn\u2019t be enough to catch every word of my interviews. I remember how the beginnings felt so unfamiliar, meeting and asking questions to names I'd already scrutinized from stat sheets and rosters. But any nerves sank when I remembered how much fun it was to talk about you.\n\t\tI loved watching all the ways you could move. Heels anchored into grass and how spines would pivot, or squeaks of sneakers on glossy hardwood below century-old Palestra rafters. I loved how it would all happen so fast. A baton pass as fluid as turning a page of a book, or the ferocious swings of rackets and sticks and bats to mash a bulleting ball. I sought the best words to capture you on the page.\nYou showed no fear and I wanted to feel that way, too. So I plunged into your momentum and kept up. I studied score sheets and rosters like homework. I squinted across courts and fields; memorized the numbers on players\u2019 backs until I could predict the timings of coaches\u2019 substitutions. I loved catching you off-guard to hear my favorite response: \u201cThat\u2019s a great question.\u201d And when anyone would begin to explain to me the game I knew I loved, I learned to straighten my shoulders and interrupt.\n\t\t\n\t\nI spent some years matching your pace. In return, you drew some of the best words out of me. Watching my bylines stack was a thrill I\u2019d share constantly with home, and it felt unreal to think how many people would read my work the next day. But you are rapid. Your routines kept rolling, and my writing grew mechanic. Obligations heaped. Your schedules began to weigh like an anchor on my joy, and what I had feared most would happen finally caught up to flatten my spirit: I grew tired.\nBut I wasn\u2019t tired of you. I will always love being obsessed with you. ESPN still overwhelms my notifications, and I\u2019ll hopefully watch you in a London stadium soon. Maybe I grew tired of knowing you so hard. Making my living in this city became an urgent test, and I rationed my time to be able to live. I didn\u2019t want you to feel like work, too.\n\tI wondered what kind of writer you wanted me to be. What it takes to be the first to break news, to understand every sport as much as my favorite, to learn generations of legendary names I didn\u2019t grow up with. I watched those around me do it excellently. I wondered if we all shared the same amount of hours. But reality had crashed into me like a wave, and when I finally learned how to keep my chin above the surface, I found no energy left to write you in my best words anymore.\nI remember on another sunny afternoon at work, while rolling crates of silverware and counting down my hours on the clock, I watched you through a dim, cracked phone screen showing the 2022 World Cup. At every goal scored, I could hear the roar of cheers from the opposite side of the kitchen pass \u2014 occasionally delayed, but nevertheless electric, even through the brunch noise. Here was that delight, again, in a place I didn\u2019t expect. I thought about the stories I had wanted to share when I first began writing. And watching you through a smaller screen, I wondered if my distance from your bigger headlines demanded something much greater than what I could give \u2014 a distance I wasn\u2019t confident I could close.\u00a0\nSo call me lazy or stale, unambitious at most. But I felt happy when I went to a soccer game with nothing to write. This wasn\u2019t work, but a passion enjoyed. No deadline to race, no weaving of nuanced questions for interviews, nor a fiery stance on zonal marking versus man-to-man to prove I know what I\u2019m talking about. I stood in the stands as just a fan of you. I rooted for a side, ignored the names of away team substitutions, and the delight of you returned.\nI couldn\u2019t become that trailblazer you craved. But now I\u2019ll settle for the gallery afar, watching you continue to flourish for your favorite kind of crowd. So let me flourish, too. I won\u2019t give all my words to you anymore \u2014 even if everything about you seemed so ideal in those evening hours, when the sun would set over the Schuylkill as the timeclock inched down, and the players on the field continued to just run, chasing you and one another into the back of that white net, and I was the one there to write about it all. You were a thrill unmatched, even as my own feet stood still. So perhaps I'll return to you sometime soon, when I've grown a little more in myself, and my view from the stands calls again to spill out into words.\nESTHER LIM is a College senior studying English with a concentration in creative writing from Georgia.

          "article_content": "If you\u2019re reading this self-serving trip down memory lane, you might be one of my friends and family. Or, more likely, you\u2019re trying to read about the encampment and got lost on The Daily Pennsylvanian\u2019s website.\nIf you\u2019re in the latter camp, just hit the menu button on the top left and go to news. And if you\u2019re reading this in the physical paper \u2026 Who am I kidding, nobody actually picks up one of those. But if you\u2019re one of my friends and family, I\u2019m going to tell a story you might have already heard. Bear with me.\n\t\tWhile I was sports editor, a group of us made the seven-hour commute to Hanover, N.H., to cover a football game at Dartmouth College. At the time, we did a \u201cPicks are In\u201d column, where we\u2019d predict each week\u2019s game. All but one of our writers picked Dartmouth, who were 11.5-point favorites.\u00a0\nCut to: Penn somehow wins in double overtime, I\u2019m in the process of writing what will become an extremely mediocre recap, and we\u2019re sitting in a nearly empty press conference waiting to speak to Penn\u2019s coach.\n\t\t\n\t\nOne of us eventually asked him, \u201cWhat message do you think this win sends to the rest of the Ivy League?\u201d While staring directly at us, he said, \u201cI don\u2019t think anyone gave us a chance today... People were writing stories without giving us Quakers a chance. So message: We are 3-0, ready to play another game next week.\u201d\u00a0\nI checked. We were the only ones that had written a word about this game.\n\tWe, a group of 20-year-olds, had published something that pissed off a Division I football coach, and when we were proven wrong, he rightly told us to our faces.\nIt was completely fair for him \u2014 who, I should mention, is a very nice guy \u2014 to call us out. And it gets at a key aspect of college sports journalism: It can be very bizarre.\u00a0\nOne time, I was covering a road football game from my room. I watched the game on TV, and a buddy of mine came in and watched with me. With 10 minutes to go, we were talking about a Penn running back that was tearing through Cornell\u2019s defense.\n\u201cOh yeah,\u201d I said. \u201cI'll probably talk to him.\u201d\nI was on the phone with the running back a little over 10 minutes later. As my friend sat bemused on my couch, the guy who just charged through linemen on my TV was on the phone with me so I could mumble disjointed questions at him.\nAgain, bizarre.\nFormer Sports Editor Brandon Pride and I once traveled to New York for a baseball series at Columbia University. In the second game of the series, Penn blew a six-run lead in the last couple innings and lost on a walk-off homer.\nRough way to lose. And rough for Brandon and me, who now had to talk to the coach about their collapse.\u00a0\nWe waited as the team emerged from the dugout, terrified of having to confront a coach whose team just lost in the worst way imaginable. As he came out, we told him who we were, and he quickly exclaimed, \u201cOh wow, thanks for coming out, guys!\u201d and couldn\u2019t have been any nicer.\nYou never know what to expect from the people you\u2019re interviewing. Like how you don\u2019t expect Rick Pitino to tell you and the rest of a cramped postgame press conference about how the NCAA got its comeuppance in his infamous \u201cladies of the night\u201d investigation.\nBut that\u2019s part of what makes this very specific brand of journalism so great, and the memories I have from it are some of the best from my time in college.\nAfter that Dartmouth game, we drove 45 minutes in the middle of the night to a place called \u201cD Acres Permaculture Farm & Educational Homestead.\u201d\nIf that sounds like it\u2019s not a luxury hotel, you would be correct. I\u2019d waited till the last couple days before our trip to book a hotel. Much to my surprise, it was Family Weekend at Dartmouth, which meant that all the hotels in Hanover were full. The only one available was D Acres, located more or less in the middle of nowhere.\u00a0\nIt was cheap, so D Acres had that going for it.\nWe drove up around midnight to what looked like a haunted house, unsure if we\u2019d end up sleeping in the car. To our surprise, it was actually quite nice. The room next to the kitchen was for butchering pigs, and you needed to pay with quarters to shower. But the beds were comfy, and we weren\u2019t in a tent like the website suggested we might be.\nFor less than $60 a person, it was a good value. Plus, like many trips, it was a night with friends that I\u2019ll never forget.\n\n\n\n\n                Photos courtesy of Matthew Frank\n      \n\n\nI\u2019ve written over 120 articles for the DP (yikes), and although a couple of those were actually pretty good, it\u2019s the memories and the friends that I\u2019ll be most proud of and thankful for about my time in DPOSTM (The DP\u2019s Only Section That Matters, for the uninformed).\nI\u2019m thankful for the guys on Sunday Shift\u2122, for being the only reason I\u2019d ever wake up before noon on a Sunday.

          "title": "Fiona Miller | Ambitions, amnesia, and ambivalence",
          "article_content": "When senior spring rolled around, a warning email from Career Advising landed in my inbox. URGENT. Apparently, my current enrollments would not complete my degree requirements. Apparently, I wouldn\u2019t graduate. As always, procrastination came back to bite me.\n\u201cSocial Impact and Responsibility: Foundations\u201d: the last class I needed to complete my concentration. As the name suggests, the course was meant to be entry-level, taken at the beginning of my academic journey, not at the tail end. Every semester, I pushed this three-hour seminar off. I could push it off no longer.\n\t\tAfter an email with my advisor, who not-so-politely suggested that I should have planned my course load better, I finally enrolled in Social Impact Foundations during my senior spring. A three-hour seminar, a foundations course as a senior \u2014 I couldn\u2019t wait.\nThe first assignment for the cursed course \u2014 which, due to my late enrollment, would be submitted well past the due date \u2014 was a legacy paper. In 2050, when you look back at your life (both personal and professional) what will you consider to be your main achievement \u2014 your legacy?\u00a0\nTo some, this assignment would kindly be referred to as easy and unkindly referred to as busy work. To a senior soon to be facing the real world, legacy was terrifying. All that mattered was what immediately lied in front of me: graduating, getting a job, getting into law school. I was too young to think about myself at age 48, and it was way too early to cement my legacy.\nLegacy? So terrified by this word, I had actually enrolled in and immediately dropped this course a year prior. Now, I was backed into a corner and forced to face my legacy head-on. I debated dropping my concentration entirely, but that meant admitting defeat to my concentration advisor. So I stayed in the course, mostly out of stubbornness and partly out of spite.\u00a0\n\tI began thinking back to the dreams I wrote about in my college application. Who was I when I came here?\nAt 18, I told my dad I wasn\u2019t applying to Penn. Why bother if there was no chance I would get in? In southwest Virginia, most of my peers would stay in-state or head down to Southeastern Conference schools. No one from my area had been to Penn in recent years; Philadelphia was a strange new land.\u00a0\nMy dad disagreed. Spoken like a recreational soccer coach, he replied: \u201cYou miss 100% of the shots you don\u2019t take.\u201d The what-ifs loomed too large to brush off. Hours before the deadline, I submitted my Wharton application. When decision day rolled around, my family and I jumped up and down in excitement \u2014 not over an acceptance, but over a spot on the waitlist. My shot in the dark was met with a wait and see, a more favorable outcome than a rejection. By a mix of luck, chance, and the rise of COVID-19 gap years, I was ultimately accepted. And with the payment of my deposit, Pandora\u2019s box was opened.\nAt 18, I knew all the numbers about Penn: rankings, post-graduate outcomes, CU limits, and course requirements. Over time, numbers became my litmus test. Numbers assured me I was on the right track. Apply for five clubs, like everyone else. Apply for dozens and dozens of internships, like everyone else. Stop sleeping eight hours a night \u2014 no one else does.\nEach year, the numbers told me there was more I could do. Another club, another leadership position, a more challenging minor, a more challenging career. Each NSO, I felt like Sisyphus, with any progress I made erased by another tick of the clock. The numbers stretched on. Better to have two internship offers than one, better to have three leadership positions than two, better to have four A\u2019s than three A minuses\u2026\u00a0\nLiving by the numbers was no way to live. Constantly comparing myself to my successful classmates was productive to no one and crippling to myself. At some point \u2014 far too late in my college career \u2014 I stopped trying to fit a standard I didn\u2019t believe in. Far too late, I resuscitated my ambitions from amnesia.\u00a0\nFlashing forward, I returned to the legacy paper. I knew the sources of my unhappiness at Penn. I knew I hated the numbers, the never-ending comparisons. Most importantly, I knew who I didn\u2019t want to be. For now, that could be enough. I wrote the legacy paper. I stayed in the three-hour seminar. I will graduate with the concentration that I applied to Penn with.\u00a0\n\t\tGet our newsletter, DP Daybreak, delivered to your inbox every weekday morning.As seniors know, much of spring term is reminiscing and remembering: thinking back to first-year roommates, old friend groups, long-abandoned majors and minors, and pre-professional tracks. The legacy paper, the bane of my existence, forced me to look both backwards and forwards. The assignment made me face uncomfortable questions of \u201cWhat does success mean to you?\u201d and \u201cWho even are you, really?\u201d\u00a0\nLike most seniors, I don\u2019t really know the answers. I am graduating with a degree that claims I know something when really, I feel more confused than I did at 18.

          "article_content": "\u201c5 Fun Things To Do in Philadelphia,\u201d read the subject line of my most recent email.\u00a0\nSitting in my childhood bedroom back in 2020, I curiously pondered over this random email that landed in my inbox. With no connection to the city, I didn\u2019t understand why this was relevant to me. I almost ignored it, if not for my superwoman of a mother who reminded me that I was still on Penn\u2019s waitlist. I had previously concluded that Penn was no longer a possibility, but thankfully, my mom urged me to check the portal anyway.\u00a0\n\t\tMy screen was adorned with red and blue confetti \u2014 I had, in fact, been accepted to Penn. After re-reading the acceptance letter about 15 times to make sure my eyes were not deceiving me, my heart sank when I noticed the date. I was accepted over a week prior, but I had no idea because I missed the original email notification.\u00a0\nIf I had not seen the subsequent email advertising Philadelphia\u2019s main attractions, I may have missed the deadline to make an enrollment decision, or I may have never even known that I got into Penn. I was so grateful to still have the chance to attend this prestigious university despite being so irresponsible, and I made a promise to take advantage of every opportunity this school offered.\u00a0\n\t\t\n\t\nAnd that I did.\u00a0\nMy Penn experience has been nothing short of fulfilling. Though my first year was characterized by measures of isolation (virtual classes, mandatory masks, grab-and-go dining), I had never felt more connected with others. Call it trauma bonding, but there is something unifying about being a \u201cCOVID freshman\u201d that only the Class of 2024 could ever understand.\n\tMy first year was also the time when I joined The Daily Pennsylvanian as an opinion columnist, and over the next four years, I would write, edit, podcast, and even create crossword puzzles. I learned how to navigate ruthless backlash from readers attacking my character and my intellect, and I served as a deputy editor during one of the most polarizing times in DP history \u2014 two formative experiences that have shaped who I am as a person and a writer. I credit the DP for planting the seeds of my future in journalism, and I would not have had the privilege of working for NBC News, CNN, and ABC News without my roots here.\u00a0\nAside from the career benefits, writing for the DP also presented opportunities to unravel years of internalized racism. My articles about Asian hate and xenophobia in Congress may not seem significant to the average reader, but this represented a huge step forward in not only accepting my racial identity, but being proud to publicly defend it. Coming from a predominantly white neighborhood and high school, I never truly felt comfortable in my own skin and even cringed at my culture. I am ashamed to admit this now, but I sought to assimilate by subconsciously surrounding myself with white friends, American cuisine, and white norms.\u00a0\nWhile this may sound like an absurd paradox, joining a sorority further prompted me to embrace my Asian identity. I began to see Asian women engaging in social endeavors and being welcomed in spaces that I had previously assumed were exclusive to white individuals. And though Greek life undoubtedly has a litany of faults in regards to diversity and inclusion, I do credit Penn\u2019s chapter of Alpha Phi for providing my first friendships with girls that actually looked like me. I have had some of the deepest conversations with these women regarding shared backgrounds, childhood similarities, and generational differences \u2014 topics that I never even fathomed to touch on beforehand.\u00a0\nThese social interactions remain my most treasured takeaway from college. Of course, all the sweaty frat basements, overpriced downtown events, and BYO dinners are core memories in my Penn experience. But rather than reminiscing about these drunken nights, I am more proud of the friendships that these social outings have rewarded me with. I have met my best friends that know me better than I know myself, some of whom I would quite literally consider to be family. I have learned about love and loyalty, support and sacrifice, trauma and tragedy.\nMy friends have also inspired me in a myriad of ways, and I\u2019ll never tire of watching them launch companies, save lives, and change the world. They dedicate their hearts and souls to every endeavor, including athletics, the arts, and other extracurricular activities. In fact, witnessing my peers\u2019 passions has served to revitalize my own. As a competitive figure skater for over 12 years who suffered from burnout and grew to despise the sport, I refused to step foot on the ice again. Though I joined the Penn Figure Skating Club during the fall of my first year, it was not until senior spring (seven semesters later) that I visited the Penn Ice Rink for the very first time.

          "title": "Caroline Magdolen | This could be your call to adventure",
          "article_content": "Opinion applications for The Daily Pennsylvanian were due on a rainy, pandemic-era September day. Zoning out in a Zoom lecture, I wondered if I really wanted to put the effort into penning a sample column. Wouldn\u2019t I just get rejected?\nBut then I remembered what Mr. Henderson, my high school English teacher, wrote to me that spring. He said he associated me with the newspaper, complimenting my writing style and how I gave my all on every assignment. If at least one person thought that I belonged at the paper, I may as well give it my best shot.\u00a0\n\t\tIt\u2019s a pretty solid call to adventure, don\u2019t you think?\nWhen I started writing columns, I was scared stiff of saying something that would get construed the wrong way. I reviewed every last letter and punctuation mark of my drafts, and asked my friends to do the same. With that diligence, I grew as a writer. I started speaking up in meetings, and then, in my junior year, I led them as the opinion editor.\u00a0\n\t\t\n\t\nFor the longest time, I chose to interpret my time at Penn, and at the DP, as a kind of hero\u2019s journey, where I finish demanding assignments with aplomb, and every adversity teaches me a valuable lesson. Most of us do some version of that. We hope to graduate feeling triumphant, having risen through the ranks and gained expertise in the activities and academics that we invested in. We hope that our next steps involve a dream job or school \u2014 a dream life, even.\nI entered Penn my senior fall, eager to get my storybook resolution come graduation. Leaving my summer internship with glowing reviews from my mentors, I was assured of a return offer. And having made a pact with my friends to take no more than 5.5 CUs, I would be coasting, relative to my earlier 6.5 and 7 CU terms as a dual-degree student. This was the term where, instead of learning the ropes of Penn and fighting to stay afloat, I would explore and navigate new waters.\u00a0\n\tBut then, as the clock struck midnight and September began, my email inbox greeted me with a \u201cwe regret to inform you\u201d message from the company I had interned at \u2014 the first of many, many eventful emails in my inbox. I dropped down to 4.5 CUs after struggling with a coding assignment for 20-something hours, but my workload hardly let up after that.\nOver the following months, 30 and 40-hour weeks at the DP became my norm: speaking with our (incredibly, insanely dedicated) staffers and editing and fact-checking columns. I was hopping on phone calls and writing replies to email chains, dozens of messages deep in the middle of the night. By the end of the year, Opinion published over 200 staff and guest columns with diverse perspectives on campus life and current events \u2014 there is nothing I am prouder of having worked on at Penn.\nNone of it would have been possible without the immense support and kindness from so many wonderful, driven people. Thank you Emi, Imran, and Jesse \u2014 in the most tumultuous of times in the Pink Palace, I could count on you to advocate for Opinion and to give your all into leading the DP, which means more than words can express. Thank you Yomi, Vinay, and Emily for being the absolute best deputy editors Opinion 139 could ask for, and Matteo, for your careful sensitivity reading and suggestions. Thank you Derek, Benjamin, and all of Photo and Design for the beautiful doms, and for goofing off with me during production nights. Thank you Allyson, Julia, and all of Copy! You are the backbone of the DP.\nAnd of course, I am most grateful for the wit, enthusiasm, and commitment of every single columnist I have had the privilege to work with; your stories captivated thousands of minds and inspired countless debates.\nIf I was still going after that storybook resolution, I\u2019d tell you that upon retirement from the DP, I rode off into the sunset to some magnificent end-credits-style music. At our banquet, I was honored to receive the Editor of the Year award, and after applying to full-time positions for months, I suddenly had to decide between three great job offers over the span of two weeks.\nBut it\u2019s not all that simple \u2014 I\u2019ve learned this spring that 5.5 CUs can feel just as soul-sucking as 7 (thanks, NETS 2120), and I\u2019ve had my fair share of tough conversations, embarrassing slip-ups, and everyday misfortunes. With the turmoil and tensions both on campus and worldwide right now, it feels disingenuous to tell a story where everything wraps up neatly, with no loose ends.\nI said before that in a hero\u2019s journey, each adversity teaches you a lesson \u2014 but that\u2019s not how life actually works. Sometimes, you just screw up, for no reason other than bad luck or a bout of clumsiness. Sometimes, there\u2019s no purpose to it: only pain.\nBecause of that, I\u2019ve given up on the hero\u2019s journey altogether. Shifting away from grandiose but precarious narratives that hinge on external validation, like acceptances and awards, I now prefer to focus my story on the day-to-day minutiae that bring me joy and stability. It is filled with lovely little moments, like chatting with my roommates over spicy, piping-hot bowls of instant ramen, or taking in the fresh air and ambiance as I walk through the Woodlands.\u00a0\n\t\tGet our newsletter, DP Daybreak, delivered to your inbox every weekday morning.My life feels far fuller with this type of story than when I\u2019ve tried to contort my time at Penn into a narrative with some meaningful conclusion to it all. I have flourished in many ways here. But in others, I am very much a work-in-progress, and that\u2019s perfectly fine. I hope that you will come to adapt your stories as you grow and change too \u2014 sticking with a rigid narrative for too long is no fun.\nI suppose I\u2019ll end here on the same line that got me into this whole (glorious) mess in hopes that it inspires somebody else: whoever you are, if you so desire, you can belong at the paper. Start writing stories, and never stop. Be curious and skeptical about every narrative you examine \u2014 ask lots of questions and raise objections when you see fit. You\u2019re going to be brilliant.\nCAROLINE MAGDOLEN is a College and Engineering senior studying earth science and systems engineering from New York City.

          "title": "Riane Lumer | The social clock is ticking, according to who?",
          "article_content": "Five years ago during a college tour trip, I vividly recall sitting in a hotel, gazing out the window at the skyline of Boston. I felt inspired; I was eager to write my supplemental essays about why I wanted to attend Boston College (BC), and why I wanted to become a teacher. BC\u2019s Lynch School of Education and Human Development attracted me because of its education program.\nThis tour was a few weeks before I was selected to present a speech at the back-to-school convocation in front of every K-12 teacher in the district on my passions for education and teaching. Becoming a teacher was a personality trait for me. \u201cMost likely to become part of Lower Moreland Faculty: Riane Lumer.\u201d I even won a scholarship award for someone potentially entering the field of education. \u201cWe\u2019ll be colleagues one day!\u201d my choir director constantly joked my senior year. \u201cYou\u2019ll take over the organization in the future,\u201d my Mini-THON advisor told me.\u00a0\n\t\tI had wanted to be an English teacher since I was in fifth grade \u2014 or so I thought.\nMy sophomore year at BC, I student-taught at Brighton High School, a turnaround Boston public school in Massachusetts. This was something I was itching to do throughout my first year. I just wanted to get in the classroom.\u00a0\n\t\t\n\t\nLike most city schools, students in the urban district are victims of pervasive systemic disparities that contribute to educational debt. I recognized this upon the first day of my pre-practicum and felt a need to assist on a political level. My passion for reform only intensified after more time connecting with students.\u00a0\nBut this desire extends beyond the role of a teacher. \u201cThere\u2019s only so much a teacher can do within the classroom for change,\u201d I thought to myself.\u00a0\n\tAnd so, after a month of teaching, I began to heavily question a future in it. That frightened me\u00a0\u2014 leading me to suppress these feelings until the end of the semester, when I truly began to consider that this really wasn\u2019t the path for me. I didn\u2019t want to swallow that pill. I didn\u2019t think I knew myself without it.\nI was grieving a dream that died, a future for myself that no longer matched what I had imagined for years. New experiences and exposures changed me and sparked bigger aspirations. But I also felt as though I failed myself; my family always told me teaching wasn\u2019t for me, and I thought I was rebelling. Well, they were right, but for different reasons.\u00a0\nI added a third major: political science. But I was faced with another dilemma. The licensure teaching program at BC was the last thing keeping me there. And the summer prior to that, the excitement for student-teaching and jump-starting my career in education counteracted my detached emotions toward the atmosphere of BC.\u00a0\nI applied to transfer to NYU during the spring semester of my sophomore year. I enrolled in their education school, but I didn\u2019t attend. I wanted to give BC one more shot: it was my top choice, and I wanted it to feel the way I expected. And I wanted my zeal for teaching to return, because that was all I thought I knew and was attached to. That linear path was comforting to me. It was something that I felt was within my grasp and control.\nOn May 18, 2022, I received my acceptance to Penn as a junior transfer majoring in political science. Yes, a junior transfer who also was entering with a new major that they had only taken one course for at their prior institution.\u00a0\nEmbracing my desire to transfer and reshape my career trajectory ignited my newfound eagerness to continuously explore new avenues that ignite my joy and curiosity. When I got onto Penn\u2019s campus, I applied to join The Daily Pennsylvanian\u2019s opinion and podcast departments and became a writer for 34th Street Magazine. At BC, I was involved primarily in educationally-oriented activities. It was my whole world; anything like writing for the student newspaper felt irrelevant to my future career. I was wrong and naive. And I ended up writing about it.\u00a0\nBecause of my experiences at the DP and with my journalistic writing minor, I explored the world of journalism \u2014 a discipline one of my English professors at BC suggested would be a good fit for me. But I refused to depart from what I thought was my path, until my college experience took an unexpected turn on its head.\u00a0\nCurrently, I\u2019m unsure exactly what the future holds for me, but I am learning to find peace in all of the possibilities. When I transferred, I abandoned the habit of attempting to assume control over every aspect of my life and plan each detail. Instead, I embrace the uncertainty of the future and approach my twenties as a blank canvas, ready to be painted with new experiences and opportunities.\u00a0\nMy college experience has been anything but conventional. Although I will be walking across the stage this month, I will not be officially graduating until December \u2014 another detour from what I expected when transferring to Penn and assuming I would \u201cgraduate on time.\u201d\nWhen I met with my advisor and he broke the news to me that I would not be graduating \u201con time,\u201d I panicked and my stomach dropped. Instinctively, I felt that I was falling behind. But in the aftermath of that moment, I began to question the concept of \u201con time.\u201d What does it truly mean? Especially for me? I realized that this phrase carries little significance \u2014 it's more about when things unfold as they're meant to. The right time is when it happens, and this fall, I will be embarking on another chapter by participating in the Penn in Washington program in D.C. (another transfer application bucket list item!).\u00a0\nThe social clock, a sociological theory identified by Bernice Neugarten, is a timetable of expectations for reaching milestones in your life predicated on external pressures and cultural norms embedded into societal structures. But as I have come to view it, the pressures of the social clock can seep into every level of decision-making in your life, if you allow it to sway you in determining how to act according to what you believe society would expect of you, or adhering to what others are doing around you.\u00a0\nI fell victim to this when experiencing dilemmas about my future. Now, I check myself as I fall into its harmful cycles time and time again. During rush, girls consistently asked me what post-grad job I had lined up or where I would be living. I didn\u2019t know, but I was no longer embarrassed. Everyone has their own timelines, and we are all working to figure them out. The rigorous, hyper-competitive nature of Penn especially subscribes to the demands of the social clock, so beware.\u00a0\nI find that the best way to withdraw yourself from this phenomenon is to know yourself. To listen to yourself. I encourage you to ask yourself, who are you? What sparks your curiosity? What excites you? What makes you tick? Are you driven by passions you have developed, or are you driven to fit the mold of what you think society expects of you?\u00a0\nAs I write this on my last day of classes at Penn, I sit at my desk reflecting on the past two years of my journey while a mug gifted from Penn\u2019s Transfer Student Organization to seniors sits next to my computer reading, \u201cI survived transferring.\u201d\u00a0\n\t\tGet our newsletter, DP Daybreak, delivered to your inbox every weekday morning.Yes, I did. But more importantly, I've transformed into a person I never envisioned \u2014\u00a0I was so overly fixated on preserving what felt safe and comfortable that I lost sight of who I was actually evolving into. \u00a0\nI leave with a reminder to my future self and to all of you: It's okay to outgrow places, people, things, habits, visions, or worldviews. Don't feel guilty about change and growth \u2014 untether yourself as you enter into new phases. We are here to exist, enjoy, experience, not to entertain a procedural social clock that may deter you from who you really are.\u00a0\nRIANE LUMER is a College senior studying political science and journalistic writing from Huntingdon Valley, Pa.

          "title": "Allyson Nelson | If you love something, let it go",
          "article_content": "Of the dozens of campus tours I\u2019ve given for the Kite and Key Society, each one has been different. I\u2019d switch out old stories for new ones or change how I\u2019d present information to prospective students and their families. The start of my tours, however, always remained the same:\n\"Penn was founded in 1740 by Benjamin Franklin. He was a founding father of the United States, printer, inventor, and so much more. Franklin didn\u2019t like to be defined by just one thing, and that\u2019s the spirit we love to embody through interdisciplinary experiences here at Penn.\"\n\t\tI said these lines almost every week for my three years as a tour guide, yet I never thought of internalizing them myself. Even though I had varying interests both inside and outside of the classroom, I defined my identity as the girl who worked for The Daily Pennsylvanian for the majority of my time as a Penn student.\nThe DP was the first organization that I joined at Penn. As a lonely first-year student going stir-crazy in my bedroom due to the COVID-19 pandemic, I elected to join a club during my spring semester to give myself something to do outside of my schoolwork. After aimlessly scrolling through the Penn Clubs website, I stumbled upon the DP\u2019s page. My high school didn\u2019t have a newspaper, so I was weary of writing. But I\u2019ve always loved grammar. Thus, my love of copy editing was born.\n\t\t\t\tSEE MORE FROM ALLYSON NELSON:\ufeffPenn softball swept by Harvard'A perfect fit': Penn softball's Megan Huang is off to a strong startEverything after that point was a blur. I entered the DP\u2019s Pink Palace for the first time when COVID-19 restrictions were lifted, learned the intricacies of fact-checking and style editing, and realized that I was part of something much bigger than myself. I sought leadership as soon as I was able, and before I knew it, my entire world revolved around the DP.\nI prioritized the DP above all else. I\u2019d push off assignments to edit articles, tune out in class to look over a breaking story and cancel plans with friends to take on extra DP work. Even as a deputy copy editor, the DP was a full-time job. And when I finally became one of the two head copy editors on the 139th Board, I felt like I was always working overtime. If I wasn\u2019t actively editing, I was thinking about the DP. I kept my phone on me at all times, anxious that a breaking story would suddenly come through and I\u2019d need to edit at a moment\u2019s notice.\n\tIt slowly dawned on me after my first semester as copy editor that this life was no longer sustainable. The DP was negatively impacting my academic life, personal relationships, and mental health, and there was only so much more I could handle. Coinciding with the fact that I had just been elected summer executive editor \u2014 meaning I hadn\u2019t taken any extended time off from the DP in two years \u2014 I knew that I needed change. So what did I do? I accepted leadership positions in other clubs alongside my work at the DP.\nTo the naked eye, this decision seemed insane. But what I realized in my first semester as copy editor is that I didn\u2019t know how to tell the DP no. I took on work that I didn\u2019t have to simply because I didn\u2019t have a reason not to. With new responsibilities elsewhere on campus, particularly with Kite and Key and Social Planning and Events Committee Connaissance, I learned that it was okay to take time away from the DP to pursue other opportunities that excited me. These leadership roles taught me how to manage over 100 people, plan large-scale events, and work with major Penn offices, which is something I did not have the ability to do at the DP.\nThis was one of the best decisions I\u2019ve ever made at Penn. Finding other communities on campus made me realize how much I loved the DP. That\u2019s not to say that my other communities were lesser than \u2014 they certainly weren\u2019t \u2014 but taking a step back from the DP allowed me to appreciate the work that I was beginning to resent. I didn\u2019t always groan when a new article to edit was sent to me, nor would I dread having to go into the office. For the first time in a while, I was excited about the DP.\nThis new perspective allowed me to grow even closer with my DP community. My love had never waivered for them before, but my changed outlook made me appreciate their support so much more. It takes a village to keep the DP going, and I am so grateful that I got to work alongside some of the most passionate and motivated people at Penn.\nJulia was the best co-copy editor I could ask for, and our work would not have been possible without the dedication of our wonderful copy deputies \u2014 Charlotte, Diamy, Eleanor, Laura, Maddie, and Riley \u2014 and our equally amazing copy associates. Emi, Imran, and Walden were such strong leaders throughout my time on board, and they believed in me when I could not believe in myself. I am also thankful for Alexis and Caleb, the 139 sports editors, who welcomed me with open arms when I wanted to give sports writing a try as a junior.\n\t\tGet our newsletter, DP Daybreak, delivered to your inbox every weekday morning.My time at the DP would not have been possible without the people who came before me. I am grateful for my copy editor predecessors, Brittany and Sophie, and am also thankful for Delaney, Jonah, and Tyler, who started as my mentors but ended up becoming my closest friends.\nI always ended my tours by saying that if I had to go through the college application process 100 times over, I\u2019d still choose Penn every time. The same goes for the DP. My time in the Pink Palace taught me to be detail-oriented, how to work under pressure, compromise with people who you may not agree with, and \u2014 most importantly \u2014 the difference between an em-dash and an en-dash. Despite the bumps in the road, I\u2019m so glad that the DP was the headline of my Penn experience \u2014 even if it took me time to appreciate it fully.\nALLYSON NELSON is a College senior studying English and American history from Philadelphia.

          "title": "Tulia Falleti | The aftermath I had feared is here",
          "article_content": "Guest columnist Tulia Falleti writes to resign from the position of Chair of the Faculty Senate.Early on the morning of May 10, in less than one hour, the Philadelphia police removed the Gaza Solidarity Encampment protesters from the College Green of our campus. Penn students, staff, and faculty, with their hands zip-tied behind their backs, were separated one by one from those embracing them as they sat on the ground or locked arms around the iconic Ben Franklin statue. Not a punch or a rock was thrown; no one so much as spat.\u00a0\nSince April 25, as Chair of the Faculty Senate, I have observed the encampment, walking by its perimeter several times a day. It was a peaceful protest. I wrote so in a guest column published in The Daily Pennsylvanian on May 4, and I stand by my assessment. On May 6, during one of my visits to the perimeter of the encampment, I noticed a person standing behind the white board that announced the events for the day. I entered the encampment a few feet to read the back of the white board. Listed there were 14 \u201cCommunity Guidelines and Principles.\u201d Number 10 read: \u201cDo not engage with counter-protesters or bad-faith agitators.\u201d\u00a0\n\t\tDuring the two weeks of the encampment, despite events of individualized harassment and intimidation against protesters that were reported to the Penn police and to the Committee on Open Expression, protesters remained non-violent. The speed with which the police were able to dismantle the protest is itself evidence of the protesters\u2019 refusal to resort to violence. Members of our community who characterize chants, signs, flags, even graffiti (which our student protesters covered and asked to be removed) or paint on our beloved founder Ben Franklin\u2019s statue as forms of violence need to turn on their TVs and tune in to violent protests or war scenes from around the world. We can certainly talk about symbolic violence or of hurtful forms of expression, but no one in our campus can say that the encampment that was on College Green from April 25 until this morning \u2014 and that included not only Penn members but also members of the larger Philadelphia community \u2014 has caused any physical harm or physical violence.\u00a0\nThe encampment grew on the evening of May 8, which was of great concern to me. In a worldwide, student-led social movement, in which the encampment \u2014 i.e. peaceful protest with tents \u2014 is a strategy for protest or part of its main repertoire, its modus operandi, and is the only bargaining power that protesters have, the growth of the encampment\u2019s footprint could only indicate one reality: negotiations with the University administration were not progressing. Was the University negotiating in good faith and with respect for the student protesters as our former President Sheldon Hackney had done when negotiating divestment from South Africa in the early 1980s? I could not tell. Did the encampment occupy part of our University\u2019s lawns? Yes, a tiny fraction of those campus properties on which the institution does not pay property taxes and which expand over a significant part of West Philadelphia. Was it disruptive to our educational mission? No, it was not. The building closest to the encampment, College Hall, is under construction, and as of May 1, there are no more classes on campus. Van Pelt Library is across from the encampment, but even when the chants were at some of their highest volume, our students were studying undisturbed in the library. Students also took graduation photos around the encampment, both in front of College Hall and at the Button and the LOVE statue. It was only on the evenings of May 8 (when negotiations had stopped) and May 9 and this morning that university operations were interrupted as the University prepared to clear the encampment. Had the University taken a different approach, our educational activities and access to buildings would have continued uninterrupted.\u00a0\n\t\t\n\t\nI was ending my first year of high school when the last military dictatorship came to an end in my native Argentina. The following year, with my fellow high-school students, we were able to do what the generation before ours could not: We could go into the streets and protest, and we could also occupy our buildings in protest. The generation before mine had been arrested, killed, and disappeared for protesting \u2014 even when the cause was free public transit rides for students. Thanks to our newly regained democracy, my classmates and I could join almost weekly protests in support of democracy, of human rights, of justice, or workers\u2019 rights. And our sit-ins and building occupations always ended with good faith negotiations, never by force. Those were formative political experiences that shaped my future civic and political life and oriented me toward becoming a social scientist and an educator.\u00a0\nToday, I am heartbroken that my university, the institution where I have taught, carried out my research, and worked in service of our students, staff, and faculty in myriad ways for over twenty years, has decided to send in the police to arrest its own students, staff, and faculty. I have been asked if I would hold the same position if the protesters were part of a worldwide encampment movement that was pro-abortion or against immigration. My answer is unequivocally \u201cYes!\u201d I would defend and uphold their right to peacefully protest, because this is a fundamental bedrock right of democracy. The fact that this protest \u2014 like the Occupy Wall Street or the rent protest movements before \u2014 used tents should have led our university community to talk about our land, how we occupy it, how it is taxed (or not) by our city, how it serves our mission, and how we use it. At this precise moment, in fact, the construction work that is going on around College Hall has occupied a larger footprint of our College Green area than the encampment did. Moreover, unlike other universities that use their main green area for graduation, we hold our convocations and graduations in our football stadium, so there was no reason to rush to remove the encampment as the semester came to an end and graduation was due to take place in ten days and over two blocks from College Green. The fact that there were Penn students, staff, and faculty complaining about speech content should have led to discussions about free speech, not censorship. And the fact that order is \u201crestored\u201d by sacrificing rights to free speech and to non-violent protest is exactly what autocracies around the world do now and what dictatorships have done throughout history to repress civic movements and suppress rights. Moreover, the decision itself is shortsighted. The encampment can be removed today, but the worldwide student-led movement will not end.\u00a0\n\tAccording to our rules, as Chair of the Faculty Senate I was not elected but appointed instead by a small Nominating Committee of nine peers. This undemocratic process notwithstanding, I am confident that by upholding our rules and procedures, I could have continued to strive to represent the vast majority of the members of the standing faculty at Penn. For instance, our Senate Executive Committee agreed yesterday to encourage \u201cboth\u00a0the\u00a0administration\u00a0and\u00a0the negotiating team of the student-led movement\u00a0to\u00a0keep\u00a0negotiating\u00a0in\u00a0good\u00a0faith, to de-escalate, and to seek a peaceful resolution.\u201d I would have been thrilled to carry that message if there was anyone to hear it today. I am, however, no longer confident of my ability to work collaboratively with our administration that has sent in the police to arrest its own students, staff, and faculty for participating in a non-violent protest. Thus, I am hereby presenting my resignation as Chair of the Faculty Senate of the University of Pennsylvania.\u00a0\nAs a member of the standing faculty, I will continue to defend academic freedom, free speech, and due process at our university. After serving as Chair-elect and then Chair of the Faculty Senate during the last two years, I am more aware and cognizant than ever of our Faculty Handbook, our Statutes of the Trustees (in particular, Article 11), our essential Guidelines on Open Expression, our carefully structured disciplinary processes for students, our need for academic freedom, and the importance of our shared governance. I am also keenly aware of the challenges that our University has faced in the last year and that are of public knowledge. As two colleagues have recently argued, our University\u2019s rules have been written in times of calm to be applied in times of upheaval. As a faculty member, I will make every effort to ensure that our rules and procedures are followed without bias and without manipulation. That our students, staff, and faculty are treated fairly. If universities such as Penn become one-sided, partisan, and biased, if they give in to external pressures for either political or financial reasons, then there is no hope for higher education in this country or the world. The larger threat is to democracy itself, because such manipulation of our rules, policies, and procedures can only take place in non-democratic institutions.\u00a0\nI leave my leadership role in the Faculty Senate with the following unsolicited words of advice to our administration, our Trustees, our boards\u2019 advisors, and to my fellow colleagues. It comes from our students: \u201cWe commit to assuming the best intentions, granting ourselves and others grace when mistakes are made and approaching conflict with the goal of addressing, repairing, and restoring.\u201d (Guideline number eight of the Penn encampment disbanded today.) May I have the wisdom of our students and future leaders to live up to this principle in the weeks and months to come, given the mistakes committed at Penn today.\u00a0\nTULIA FALLETI is a professor of political science and the former chair of the Faculty Senate.

          "article_content": "As an alumnus of Penn, I received communication from the University a few days ago regarding the removal by Penn Police in riot gear (with the assistance of the Philadelphia Police Department) of the encampment of students protesting Israel's violations of the human rights of Palestinians in Gaza. The University's actions have not been fair or even-handed to these students, and I believe the administration is on the wrong side of history. \u00a0\nIn my view, the students\u2019 demands have been reasonable and just, as this war shows no signs of ending. On Oct. 7, a Hamas raid (which I have condemned) killed 1,100 Israelis. Today, Israel's eight-month military operations have killed 40,000 people, displaced nearly 2 million, and destroyed more than 50% of the buildings in Gaza. What Israel has done is not justice or defense, but rather barbarism and immorality by the standards of the Jewish, Christian, or Muslim religions, or by any reasonable standard of international law. It is for this reason that the International Court of Justice has allowed a case for genocide to proceed against Israel. \u00a0\n\t\tI was especially appalled that dozens of Penn faculty members traveled to Israel in January and met with Israeli President Isaac Herzog, who is specifically mentioned in the International Court of Justice finding. This is equivalent to a faculty member meeting with Vladimir Putin or Slobodan Milo\u0161evi\u0107. I cannot believe that any Arab, Palestinian, or Muslim student could think that they would be treated fairly by these faculty.\nTo say that Penn has been even-handed in its dealings with pro-Israeli and pro-Palestinian students is demonstrably false. Shortly after Oct. 7, Penn convened an antisemitism task force, which was done in partnership with the American Jewish Committee, and we have received continuous communication about this committee. I call on Penn to immediately establish a task force to specifically address Islamophobia and anti-Arab and anti-Palestinian racism on campus, and that this task force work in cooperation with the Council on American-Islamic Relations and the American-Arab Anti-Discrimination Committee. \u00a0\n\t\t\n\t\nI also call on Penn to evaluate investments in any activity which may violate human rights or international law. Such an approach needs to be applied to Israel in light of events in Gaza, but should also be applied to any other countries committing war crimes or human rights violations.\nThe demands of the students protesting on College Green were just by any reasonable standards. The University refused offers of mediation by several members of the Philadelphia City Council. Penn's actions do not enhance public safety and will produce a chilling effect on free speech in the future. I call on Penn to drop any charges against the students involved in the encampment, and apologize to the community for excessive use of force.\n\tI am currently a Platinum-level alumni donor to Penn. I am currently serving on the alumni admissions committee, and I am active in the Penn and Wharton clubs of Chicago. I will continue to support the University, but I want to reiterate how very disappointed I am in Penn's response to this crisis.\nGEORGE HONIG is a 1987 Wharton graduate.

          "article_content": "The Gaza Solidarity Encampment was disbanded on May 10.We are members of Penn Faculty Against Antisemitism (PFAA) who write to express our concern about the recent events on our campus; namely, the increase in discord within our community. First, we would like to thank Interim Penn President Larry Jameson and the administration, Penn Police, Philadelphia Mayor Cherelle Parker, and the Philadelphia Police Department for the effective, efficient, and professional clearing of the encampment to return our campus to a safe place for all students and faculty.\u00a0\nNobody wants our students to be harmed, and we do not wish to penalize anyone who is practicing their right to free expression. However, we are hopeful that the University will engage in a thorough and fair disciplinary process to ensure that students and faculty who are not adhering to the code of conduct face appropriate consequences for inciting hate and creating a threatening campus environment. This should apply to anyone fomenting hate and encouraging destruction of property. We recognize that many of these people are not students on this campus. We condemn any further escalation, especially by non-Penn agitators, and look forward to a safe and meaningful conclusion to the academic term, including long-awaited graduations, commencement, and class reunions.\u00a0\n\t\tWe welcome civil and respectful discussion. We advocate for the release of the hostages and elimination of Hamas and other organizations funded by terrorism as a critical goal to achieve in reaching an end to this war. We cannot move on as a community until we can come together as a community. The entire country is heartbroken that it has come to this with many of the college encampments, but the only way forward is to choose dialogue and understanding over hate. We are all working for a better present in hopes of creating a better future. Let us try to emerge from this experience with a renewed desire to talk and listen to one another rather than screaming across the divide.\nSigned,\n\t\t\n\t\nBenjamin Abella, MD; Perelman School of Medicine (PSOM)\nLindsey Albenberg, DO; PSOM\n\tSamuel Alperin, MD; PSOM\u00a0\nDanielle Barber, MD, PhD; PSOM\nKara Bernstein, PhD; PSOM\nMelissa Bleicher, MD; PSOM\nAkiva Cohen, PhD; PSOM\nDebbie Cohen, MD; PSOM\nGaia Coppock, MD; PSOM\nBrian Englander, MD; PSOM\nJoyce Epelboim, MD; PSOM\nBelen Esparis, MD; PSOM\nRachel Hachen, MD, MPH; PSOM\nUri Hangorsky, DDS; Penn Dental Medicine (PDM)\nJessica Hilburg, DDS; PDM\nJudith Kelsen, MD; PSOM\nSarah Lo, MD, MPH; PSOM\nDafna Ofer, MD; PSOM\nPam Pojomovsky McDonnell, MD; PSOM\nRebecca Seshasai, MD, MSHP; PSOM\n\t\tGet our newsletter, DP Daybreak, delivered to your inbox every weekday morning.Edna Schwab, MD; PSOM\nAri Weintraub, MD; PSOM\nMatthew Weitzman, PhD; PSOM\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tThe Daily Pennsylvanian is an independent, student-run newspaper.

          "article_content": "I often teach capstone research courses and supervise honors theses for the health & societies major. Some of my students use historical methods to answer their research questions. Occasionally, a student asking a historical question will explore The Daily Pennsylvanian's archives. My students have experienced surprise, delight, and sometimes shock when combing through old DP articles and learning about local, national, and international issues important to previous generations of Penn students.\nOver the past two weeks, I, like many other Penn faculty members, have deeply appreciated the professionalism and commitment of our student journalists. DP journalists have reported tirelessly about the encampment on our College Green.\n\t\tI was stunned, therefore, when I got to campus around 7:30 a.m. today, to see that police were not allowing DP reporters inside the barricade to report on the encampment removal. I asked two DP reporters and one DP photographer, who were being blocked by a line of police officers with batons, why they weren\u2019t being allowed in. \u201cThey don\u2019t take us seriously,\u201d one reporter replied. Meanwhile, I saw a reporter for a network news channel allowed to head up Locust Walk to College Green.\nA Philadelphia Inquirer article reported later today that another DP journalist, who arrived at College Green at 5 a.m. before the dismantling of the encampment began, was \u201cgrabbed by two Penn police officers and moved back from the statue. \u2018I kept saying I was a student and a member of the press,\u2019 the reporter said. \u2018I kept on asking why I wasn\u2019t allowed to be there, and I would get no responses.\u2019\u201d\n\t\t\n\t\nWhile I assume that at some point, the police must have allowed some members of the DP inside the barricade, I just want DP student journalists to know that I take you seriously.

          "article_content": "Professors Ann Farnsworth-Alvear and Zita Cristina Nunes urge us to read Penn\u2019s Guidelines on Open Expression, arguing that it would be a perversion of those guidelines for the University to discipline students organizing the encampment on College Green, or to take any measures to end the encampment other than negotiation with the protesters. I have taken their advice and read those Guidelines and find nothing that mandates negotiation as the only appropriate response by the University.\nFarnsworth-Alvear and Nunes cite the part of the Guidelines that states that \u201cIn case of conflict between the principles of the Guidelines on Open Expression and other University policies, the principles of the Guidelines shall take precedence,\u201d (Guidelines I.D), but they interpret this as if it meant that no University policy may be enforced if it restricts open expression by students. This is a misreading of that clause since that document itself makes reference to disciplinary procedures (Guidelines V.D) and mandates the University establish policies and procedures for securing permission to hold demonstrations on campus (Guidelines III.A.2.b). As I read Interim Penn President Larry Jameson\u2019s letter to the Penn community on May 6, the University has determined that the current encampment on College Green is in violation of those policies and procedures (among others), and has instructed the encampment to disperse (in line with Guidelines III.B and V.C). Since the protesters have not complied with this instruction (thus falling under Guidelines III.B), the disciplinary procedures invoked in Guidelines V.D come into play. The Guidelines also discuss the possibility of \u201c[t]erminating a meeting, event, or demonstration by force,\u201d (Guidelines V.C.4), about which it urges extreme caution, citing the possibility of exacerbating existing tensions, and the concern to avoid \u201cinjury to persons\u201d and \u201cproperty damage.\u201d\n\t\tMy point is that the University\u2019s current response to the encampment, which involves initiating the student disciplinary process against organizers yesterday, and using police to shut down the encampment this morning, is in line with its own Guidelines for Open Expression.\nSUSAN SAUV\u00c9 MEYER is a retired professor of philosophy.

          "article_content": "More than one week into the encampment on College Green, with over 150 incidents of antisemitism and harassment reported to Penn Hillel, the public endorsement of two United States-designated terrorist organizations, and two American flags planted near the encampment being forcibly removed and damaged by protesters, students have had enough. It is time to end this antisemitic and anti-American encampment now.\u00a0\nOn April 26, pro-Israeli and Jewish students sponsored a screening of the Oct. 7 massacre adjacent to the Button on campus, broadcasting the screen in the direction of the encampment. Standing just outside the encampment when the video was playing, I heard three protesters clapping and cheering as a video of an Israeli woman getting raped and paraded in the streets of Gaza was displayed. The night before, I spotted a protester wearing a sweater with a Star of David and two rats depicted on the back, which imitates Nazi-style propaganda from the 1930s.\u00a0\n\t\tThe following night, protesters were recorded cheering \u201cAl Qassem make us proud, take another soldier down.\u201d Al Qassem is the military wing of Hamas, the group behind the Oct. 7 rape, mass murder, and abduction of Israeli civilians that has contributed to the deaths of thousands of Israelis and Palestinians since it took control of Gaza in 2007.\u00a0\nLast Tuesday, I walked near the encampment and saw a large PFLP (Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine) flag flying, which is a U.S.-designated terror organization. PFLP has been behind numerous terror attacks against Israeli civilians, including the hijacking in 1976 that diverted a flight leaving Israel to Entebbe, Uganda, and the raid of a Jerusalem synagogue, killing four in 2014. PFLP also opposes all negotiations with Israel and only envisions a Middle East without a Jewish state.\n\t\t\t\tEven worse, Penn\u2019s anonymous social media app, Sidechat, has been filled with an increasing number of pro-Palestinian supporters at Penn speaking out against the encampment, citing the diversion of the encampment from the values of the protest. Instead of protesting for the establishment of a Palestinian state and the end of the war, the encampment has turned this movement into an antisemitic cesspool, where students cannot walk on campus with Judaica items without being harassed by protesters. Even worse, not all members are students. When I attempted to look inside the encampment several days ago, I was approached by two protesters acting as \u201cguards.\u201d They did not name themselves, but they both acknowledged that they were not students, just Philadelphia residents with no association to Penn. Why should people outside of the Penn community have the ability to use Penn property to sleep and harass Jewish students? Why are non-Penn affiliates determining who is and who is not allowed on parts of our campus?\nOn April 29, pro-Palestinian protesters stormed Hamilton Hall at Columbia University, shattering the front windows and taking one security guard hostage. NYPD then forcefully removed the protesters, facing instant backlash. With Columbia's administration being hesitant to clear up the protest, students were able to easily obtain access to the building and vandalize it. As the protests at Penn are continuing to radicalize, the administration must follow through on their promise to clear the encampment before it is too late. Penn could be next.\u00a0\n\tSupporting the encampment and the groups they endorse is preventing any meaningful action and dialogue from occurring at Penn. Instead of speaking to diverse groups of students about their experiences with the conflict, the encampment is choosing to invite individuals outside of the Penn community to come to Penn and harass Jewish students. Instead of inviting leaders of the Jewish community to speak with students on the other side to discuss issues and common ground, the Chabad rabbi is being denied entry into the encampment because he is visibly Jewish. Instead of making Jewish students willing to talk to pro-Palestinian protesters about points of common ground, Jewish students are being harassed with Nazi-era rhetoric and praising of terrorist organizations that want to annihilate Jews from this planet.\nIf we want real action and dialogue to occur on this campus, continuing to support an encampment that has turned into an antisemitic hatefest continuing to harass Jewish students is not the answer. There is room for dialogue, there is room for peaceful protest, and there is room for change. There is a difference between a peaceful protest to endorse a cause, and cheering for terrorist groups that actively call for the elimination of Jewish students. Harassing Jewish students is not the best method to get community members to support your cause. Enough is enough.\nBEN MESSAFI is a College first year studying economics and political science from Westchester, N.Y.

          "title": "Eyal Yakoby | The mischaracterization of the encampment is dangerous to the Penn community",
          "article_content": "University leadership correctly recognized that the recent encampment protest placed many members of the Penn community \u201cunder threat.\u201d Reading now how the story is trying to be twisted through mental gymnastics is dangerous, not only to the community members who have been under threat but also to the students who are being led to believe that breaking the law is acceptable. Reading statements from the Penn chapter of the American Association of University Professors throughout the year \u2014 as well as their press conference that paid so much attention to the police who cleared the encampment, and no attention to how we got there \u2014 is a remarkable interpretation of the facts of the case, and especially breathtaking from scholars who claim to have expertise in critical thinking. Professors, to me, are individuals whom students should look up to as those who search for the truth. But, reading statement after statement throughout the year, disappointingly, it seems that the truth for AAUP-Penn is full of misstatements and highly biased interpretations.\u00a0\nAAUP-Penn released a statement on May 10, describing the university\u2019s actions in shutting down the encampment as a \u201cViolation of the University\u2019s Guidelines on Open Expression and a cowardly, shameful attempt to silence and punish speech that administrators simply do not want to hear.\u201d On the grounds of open expression, the university is well within its guidelines to remove the encampment, and the argument that it is not is simply unfounded.\n\t\tThe concerning actions of the protesters have nothing to do with free speech. It was the conduct of the encampment that was the central issue. \u201cHomemade weapons\u201d were found at the encampment. A student was surrounded by four masked individuals flashing strobe lights in his eyes and making threats. Documents were found circulating within the encampment on \u201cinstructions for escalating\u2013including through building occupations and violence.\u201d The Benjamin Franklin statue on College Green was vandalized numerous times, and one of those times, the incident is being investigated as a \u201chate crime.\u201d The Penn Police crime logs even include \u201cterroristic threats\u201d at the encampment site. The non-Penn-affiliated members of the encampment were committing illegal trespass. None of these actions have anything to do with free speech.\u00a0\nIn addition, it is important that the right to free speech itself is not without limits, and few constitutional legal experts have claimed otherwise. I would contend that the waving of the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine flag, a United States Department of State-designated terrorist organization, while simultaneously chanting \u201cAl Qassam, make us proud,\u201d (referring to another recognized terrorist group that has committed countless atrocities) are actions that have no place on college campuses. These are examples of hate speech that incites violence. It is troubling that professors are encouraging this to continue and trying to misrepresent that reality.\u00a0\n\t\t\t\tSEE MORE FROM EYAL YAKOBY:Speaking louder than before: Penn's second chance to reject antisemitismHow the BDS movement impedes discussion and espouses antisemitism\ufeffPolitical science professor Anne Norton tweeted \u201cOur students remained peaceful at every point. Even the administration does not dispute that.\u201d Yet, the administration could not have been clearer when they said, \u201cEvery day the encampment exists, the campus is less safe. Some have aimed to characterize this as a peaceful protest. It is not.\u201d\u00a0\nPhilosophy professor Sukaina Hirji stated during the AAUP-Penn press conference that to her, \u201cSeeing hundreds of cops in riot gear arrest students and faculty sends to me, and to my students and to all of us, a very clear message about what conversations are and are not allowed on Penn's campus going forward.\u201d But when you look at the police records, only nine out of 33 of those arrested were students. So, the argument that students were driving the protest is simply false. To me, every time I walked past the encampment, it was fairly clear that a super minority of the encampment seemed even the age of a college student. And again, claiming this is about \u201cconversations\u201d avoids the issues of conduct entirely.\n\tAnother professor, Sarah Jackson, stated that the University\u2019s messaging was \u201cveering dangerously towards propaganda.\u201d She described the encampment as a space for, \u201ceducation, debate, community, and politics.\u201d This simply is not true. The encampment consistently did not allow anyone whom they deemed as \u00a0\u201cZionist\u201d to enter the encampment. A CNN reporter even showed how few of the protesters engaged with him. From my understanding, debate is difficult when you do not even want people with opposing views to be near you. Chabad Rabbi Levi Haskelevich was even physically blocked from entering the encampment, but somehow there is no condemnation of this behavior by the AAUP-Penn\u2019s press conference. Her defense of the protesters was that the students were \u201cgenuinely trying to learn.\u201d What is mind-boggling to me is that the entire University is set up for students to learn. There is no need, especially at a university, to set up an encampment in the heart of campus when there is ample infrastructure to educate students.\nElliot and Roslyn Jaffe Endowed Professor in Film Studies Karen Redrobe made a similar point. She stated that Penn has an obligation to \u201cprotect academic freedom and the free exchange of ideas.\u201d She continued, according to The Daily Pennsylvanian, to compare what Penn did to fascist governments in the 1930s to eliminate free speech. To compare Penn breaking up an unlawful encampment, after countless warnings, to Nazi Germany\u2019s actions is appalling and disingenuous. In Nazi Germany, the fascist government passed the \u201cLaw for the Restoration of the Professional Civil Service\u201d in 1933, firing and barring the vast majority of Jewish professors. They then proceeded to pass the \u201cLaw Against Overcrowding in Schools and Universities\u201d to remove Jewish students to \u201cAryanize\u201d the university. This bears little resemblance to the removal of an encampment on the grounds of a violation of Penn\u2019s policy, state law, and federal law.\nThen there was Arabic literature professor Huda Fakhreddine who described Penn\u2019s response as \u201cshameful behavior\u201d and what she described as an ongoing \u201cattack\u201d on pro-Palestinian voices. Yet, Fakhreddeine herself posted on X, the platform formerly known as Twitter, describing faculty members who went to Israel as \u201cinsolent, depraved, and morally bankrupt.\u201d It seems as though it is not the University that is attacking pro-Palestinian voices, but her who is attacking pro-Israel voices. Once more, she described the administration's actions as shameful behavior but failed to mention the illegal behavior of the encampment.\u00a0\nIt is disappointing how faculty are encouraging the unlawful and unjust behavior of the protesters. It is their encouragement that led to protests surrounding the President\u2019s House, with some even entering the house\u2019s gates. That is what shameful behavior is: getting a mob of people to target someone\u2019s house. But these professors would never report on that because it is that very behavior that is encouraged by the statement they put out. What is most troubling is that it is the students who will ultimately have criminal records as a result of this encouragement. Moreover, if their ultimate goal is to help the Palestinian cause, they should look to productive means of peace and security for both Israelis and Palestinians. This unlawful behavior distracts from what is important. Instead of defending and encouraging the behavior, they should distance themselves from it. I believe in debate and free speech; what I find problematic is the mischaracterization of reality which further puts students in harm's way.\nEYAL YAKOBY is a College senior studying political science and modern Middle East studies.

          "title": "Imran Siddiqui | Finding your space",
          "article_content": "My time at The Daily Pennsylvanian taught me an important lesson about the communities we\u2019re a part of and why we pour so much of ourselves into the spaces we inhabit. I originally joined the organization during my first semester at Penn, hoping to surround myself with like-minded people while my classmates were all scattered across the globe due to the pandemic. Four years later, I now know that in addition to managing classes, work, and other commitments, we must be intentional about immersing ourselves in spaces that help us grow and be a positive force for change.\nWhen I joined the DP, I thought that this was the place where I could do just that. I saw the impact of my words, and I am grateful for the opportunity to amplify stories from students and local activists about police violence, Penn\u2019s culpability in the underfunding of local public schools, and the University\u2019s role in the displacement of long-time Philadelphians.\n\t\tThe people I spoke with for these articles embodied this positive change that I wanted to make. Simultaneously, however, I also began to learn more about how the DP can cause harm. Other columnists have explored the DP\u2019s exclusionary history and how the problems we see today are often the result of poor representation or access. Spearheaded by the recently created Diversity Committee, the DP\u2019s 2023 demographics report highlights the underrepresentation of Black and Hispanic students within the DP when compared to Penn\u2019s undergraduate population, the low level of participation among Muslim students, and the disparity between the percentage of first-generation, low-income students on the company\u2019s board versus those just on the staff.\nI began to understand that these discrepancies do not just \u201chappen.\u201d Rather, they are the consequences of poor-quality coverage or editorial ignorance directed at these communities over time, coupled by the institutional barriers and apprehension that many marginalized groups feel toward the DP.\u00a0\n\t\t\n\t\nGiven these factors, why did I commit so much of my college experience to the DP?\u00a0\nI believe that we have a duty to leave the world better than we found it. I saw the importance and potential of the DP, and I wanted to be a part of the process to rebuild relationships with these communities the DP has neglected. Disappointed by the knowledge of the harm caused by previous editorial coverage and internal decisions, I put everything I had into my work at the DP, aiming to leverage the organization\u2019s platform to create a more equitable environment for journalists to come.\n\tEven at the end of my tenure as editor-in-chief, I know the DP remains imperfect, and there is so much more work to be done. At the same time, I know it is important to recognize and commend the good work that my team accomplished last year. I am proud of the news department\u2019s intrepid coverage of labor organizing and Penn\u2019s alleged union-busting tactics, the first staff editorials being published since 2021 thanks to the opinion department, and the growth of the @dailypennsports Instagram account supported by the collaboration between the sports, multimedia, and social media departments.\nMore than any of that, I am proud of the intentionality and thoroughness that went into every piece of content we published. As the person who fielded suggestions, feedback, and criticism from fellow Penn community members, alumni, and other stakeholders, I understand people\u2019s frustrations and concerns. There is still a lot that can be improved, but I can confidently say that the staff approached each day with a desire to do better than the day before.\nMy time at the DP has given me the privilege to learn so much about different niches across the University. The problems I see within the DP are far from unique to just one organization: they are emblematic of the issues that exist within the wider Penn community. At a campus that has historically housed one of the most depressed student bodies across the country, being intentional about creating spaces centered in care and justice becomes even more vital.\u00a0\nAs I prepare to leave Penn and I reflect on how resources and spaces are distributed across campus, the inequities become strikingly noticeable. For decades, students have advocated for diversifying Locust Walk \u2014 arguing that this main fixture of Penn does a disservice to the diversity that exists across the University due to the prevalence of administrative and fraternity buildings. The first major changes to Locust Walk in 1973 were a result of collective action when students and other community members occupied College Hall for four days to protest a series of rapes on campus, eventually leading to the creation of the Penn Women\u2019s Center.\u00a0\nChange doesn\u2019t stop there, though. We can see these same conversations happening today when looking at cultural centers\u2019 continued requests for more space on campus. After being located in the basement of ARCH for years, the University finally dedicated the entire building to the cultural resource centers last school year \u2014 even though the leaders of Penn\u2019s main minority coalition groups have repeatedly asked for their own buildings on Locust Walk to ensure students from marginalized backgrounds feel embraced and empowered on campus.\nThese conversations are also exemplified by the work of students protesting Penn\u2019s response to the ongoing genocide in Gaza. Student protesters and organizations like uPAO (formerly known as Penn Against the Occupation), Freedom School for Palestine, and Penn Faculty for Justice in Palestine established an encampment and created a space where Palestinian students feel heard at a university that remains complicit in the genocide of an entire state. They have shown us what it means to take up space to raise awareness and make positive change.\nAside from organizers\u2019 primary demands surrounding the disclosure of Penn\u2019s financial holdings and the divestment from corporations that profit from Israel\u2019s occupation of Palestine, they also urge administrators to support the creation of an independent Middle Eastern cultural center at Penn. Although the importance of a cultural space pales in comparison to the tragedy occurring each day in Gaza, it is an important part of how we think about repurposing space more equitably on a campus where Muslim and Arab students often feel overlooked and isolated. Organizing around a shared vision of a more just future allows us to reach new potentials.\n\t\tGet our newsletter, DP Daybreak, delivered to your inbox every weekday morning.At the end of my tenure as editor-in-chief last December, I could not help but be scared of letting go of something that I put so much time and effort into \u2014 not knowing if any of the positive changes I pushed for would outlast my one year at the paper\u2019s helm. At the same time, I recognized that I had to trust that there will continue to be students who care about pushing the DP forward and leveraging the space we already take up for justice. Despite my initial fears, I must be confident that the DP can be used for good \u2014 just like the tireless student journalists who paved the way for me have believed.\nMoving forward, we must continue to be intentional about the spaces we are a part of and think more deeply about how we can improve them. Whether this be on campus \u2014 ensuring our clubs and our university reflect the values we hold important \u2014 or in the places we go once we leave Penn, I urge all of us to reimagine a more just society and put the work into demanding progress.\u00a0\nIMRAN SIDDIQUI is a College senior studying political science from Grosse Pointe Park, Mich.

          "title": "Eashwar Kantemneni | Keeping an open mind",
          "article_content": "I have been a die-hard sports fan for as long as I can remember. Growing up, I was glued to my TV as I watched the Cavs and Warriors battle back-and-forth for four years straight in the NBA Finals, the Buckeyes destroyed that team up north every November for eight years straight (that will resume this fall), and my Bengals sadly following-up promising regular seasons with devastating playoff losses (thankfully that has changed). I would spend countless hours sharpening my sports knowledge and opinions through watching \"First Take\" and \"Undisputed,\" or reading practically every article on ESPN.\nDespite my strong following of sports and sports media, though, I never once saw myself in journalism, even as a hobby. My high school had a well-established newspaper with a sports section. Yet, I never once had the interest to write an article during my four years. I never really enjoyed writing in general, so I thought to myself, \u201cWhy would I spend my free time doing that?\u201d\n\t\tIn my first semester at Penn, I attended the virtual club fair and came across The Daily Pennsylvanian\u2019s Only Section That Matters (DPOSTM). I had learned about and admired the DP\u2019s importance at Penn before I even started college. While journalism still was not my interest, I thought I would keep an open mind and joined DPOSTM thinking it would at least be a good way to make some new friends with similar interests and limit my boredom from COVID-19 lockdowns. I still remember spending a whole day going through the online archives for individual game recaps for my first-ever story on Penn\u2019s 2012 football Ivy Title and the excitement I got after seeing it published online. Still, my first year at DPOSTM was relatively uneventful. I struggled to consistently write stories while balancing a loaded schedule of pre-med requirements. I never thought that the DP would soon after turn out to become an integral part of my Penn experience.\nAfter not being involved during the summer, I got an email right before the school year about becoming an associate editor. I filled out the form not expecting to get picked, as many of the clubs I had applied to at Penn ended in rejection before. However, when I got the email saying I was accepted, I was pleasantly surprised and eager to start. During my first associate shift, I felt uneasy not having met anyone from DPOSTM in person yet. Once I entered the office, though, I felt relaxed and in awe seeing all the old newspapers and posters tacked on the wall, thinking I could leave something of my own there one day. Though I had just met Brandon, Lochlahn, Joey, and Nicky, I quickly felt I was a part of their and the larger DPOSTM community. We would spend shifts talking about our NFL teams or watching random basketball games on the monitors. Their love for sports writing quickly spread to me, and I went from having written about six stories up until then to matching that total in just one week. Moreover, I began to get involved with DPOSTM outside of Wednesday shifts by attending the weekly meetings and going on road trips to cover Penn football games at Columbia and Harvard University.\n\t\t\t\tSEE MORE FROM \ufeffEASHWAR KANTEMNENI:Men's Rookie of the Year: Malachi HosleyPenn men's basketball loses fourth straight conference game in 70-61 loss to Brown?\nThat semester motivated me to eventually run for and become an editor in 2022. Initially, the responsibilities felt daunting. The long shifts on Sunday afternoons and Tuesday and Wednesday nights sounded annoying, but those concerns quickly washed away. Working with Matt to help lead the department was a great experience. He seemed like he was somehow always in control of the operation, and I did my best to help out in any way I could. Being in the office consistently allowed me to get to know and have fun conversations with people around the DP: like Caleb, Sophie, Allyson, Anna, Jonah, Asaad, Derek, and many more. Soon, they all began showing up for our weekly sports meetings and BYOs, and we ended our term with DPOSTM more integrated into the DP than ever before. The sports office also became the hub which I based my schedule around, and the editing shifts and weekly meetings became some of the highlights of my week. I even put in a few extra hours to perfect some PIG shots before we played every Sunday shift.\n\t?\nWhat I will undoubtedly remember most about DPOSTM though are covering games and the road trips we took. A few of my favorites include Matt and I convincing AComm (Penn Athletic Communications) to give us press passes to cover the March Madness games that Penn was hosting at the 76ers stadium; Brandon driving us eight hours up to Dartmouth (with a convenient excursion to explore the Connecticut State Capitol on the way) to cover Penn football\u2019s massive upset victory over the Big Green (which I predicted in the car ride there), and staying at a scary-looking farm in northern New Hampshire, only for it to be one of the most beautiful nature scenes in the morning; subbing in as an on-field photographer for Penn football\u2019s last-second comeback victory over Princeton; and driving through New York City for the first time in a thunderstorm on the way to Yale. Traveling all around the Northeast and the fun experiences I had with the people that I did not have space to mention are some of my best experiences at Penn, and I will always remember them.\n\nHad you told me before I started college that joining a student newspaper would be my biggest extracurricular activity, I would never have believed it. But after these last four years, I am thankful and proud that that is the case. As I move forward with life, I will always make sure that I keep an open mind when trying new things, with the hopes it will end up a similarly great experience like DPOSTM. \u00a0\u00a0\nEASHWAR KANTEMNENI is a College senior studying neuroscience from Cincinnati.

          "article_content": "I have loved spending my past three years as a part of The Daily Pennsylvanian more than words can properly capture. It has almost destroyed me more than once.\nThe DP has given me multiple panic attacks and lost me full nights of sleep. I\u2019m probably still recovering from the temporary insanity of spending countless hours in that windowless office at 40th and Walnut streets. And the thing is, for someone who\u2019s served two consecutive years on the company\u2019s executive board, all of this is par for the course.\n\t\tWe\u2019re a real newsroom, and newsrooms are really stressful places. The difference is that our little media company is built on college students \u2014 still kids, in many ways \u2014 managing other college students.\u00a0\nIf you\u2019re anything like me, you have a love-hate relationship with the DP\u2019s ceaseless, internal politicking and gossip. Some days, it has made me feel like Machiavelli, and on others, like I need to pull a \u201cMy Year of Rest and Relaxation.\u201d Whether exhausting (often) or exhilarating (rarely), DP drama is never not a massive time suck. Every year, like clockwork, comes the inevitable board memo about how we all need to do less of it; anyone who can solve that will be the greatest editor in our 140-year history.\n\t\t\n\t\nBut let\u2019s take it as a given that it can\u2019t be solved, and why would we want to anyway? My culturally Jewish heritage has given me an appreciation for the sacred art of the kvetch, the vent, complaining for complaining\u2019s sake. It\u2019s what lets us blow off steam and then get back to doing our jobs.\u00a0\nNominally, those jobs are \u201ceditor\u201d or \u201cmanager,\u201d but when you break it down, they\u2019re all the same thing: teacher, mentor, sensei, mafia boss. If our staffers don\u2019t know how to do their jobs, there\u2019s no way for us to do ours, and hopefully, if we teach at least one well enough, they will eventually be able to destroy us and assume our place.\u00a0\n\tAt this year\u2019s annual DP Banquet, I gave a toast to our 139th board president, Jesse Zhang, where I said something to the effect of \u201cevery board position is a service position, and the higher up on the org chart you go, the truer that is.\u201d Yet, some of the best teachers I knew during my time as a 34th Street writer \u2014 Denali Sagner or Kyle Whiting or Aakruti Ganeshan \u2014 were the ones who never ran for Street\u2019s executive board at all. They never let the climb get in the way of the work.\u00a0\nThe drama gets especially bad around elections season every November. Hushed conversations happen behind locked doors; friendships either begin to crack or implode all at once; the committee schemes while the hopefuls endlessly speculate. Remember, all these kids got into an Ivy League school. It\u2019s easy to believe that the board position you do or don\u2019t get will determine the rest of your life, or at least your time in college. It won\u2019t. But I\u2019ve been guilty of this line of thought myself, and I\u2019m grateful I never had to learn the lesson the hard way. I can admit that much.\nIn a way, I have the most respect for the people who were on board as sophomores and didn\u2019t run a second time; who got in, did what they were there to do, and got out. I think of someone like Hannah Gross, the 137th board assignments editor, whose path only crossed with mine a couple of times. We met once when she was back in the office, doing interviews for a story she was writing about the company culture. She didn\u2019t seem burned out, or like she was missing out on something. She looked happy.\nAllow me to clarify: I do not regret a single moment I spent at the DP. Without the scheming, I\u2019d be at least a few friends shorter (y\u2019all know who you are) and without the panic attacks, there would be no glossy mag to speak of today. I cherish every single person who has taught me so much \u2014 Bea, Emily, Arielle, Christine, and Katherine \u2014 and the, dare I say, prot\u00e9g\u00e9s I\u2019ve seen come up under my wing \u2014 Natalia, Norah, Sophia, Hannah, Catherine, Kate, the list goes on. I\u2019m honored to have played even the smallest part in their growth as writers and, now, as teachers themselves.\nAs Street editor-in-chief, I made my name and brand on an encyclopedic knowledge of pop culture references. So before I depart this mortal coil for good, how about one more for the road. In the sixth season of the NBC sitcom \u201cParks and Recreation,\u201d my lookalike Ben Wyatt gets laid off from his job and has no idea what to do with himself. Hmm, I wonder what that must be like.\nHe invents an absurdly complicated board game called The Cones of Dunshire: \u201c8-12 players, two wizards, a maverick, the arbiter, two warriors, a corporal, and a ledgerman.\u201d Sounds roughly like the DP company structure to me. As a former competitive Magic: The Gathering player and part-time Dungeons & Dragons aficionado, this is pretty much my love language.\nTwo seasons later, the Cones come back. Ben plays against the executives of made-up tech company Gryzzl to fight for free WiFi in his town of Pawnee, Ind. Just as it seems he\u2019s on the precipice of defeat (\u201clooks like someone\u2019s out of resource gems\u201d), Ben grins, then has a knowing chuckle: \u201cYou made one crucial mistake: you forgot about the essence of the game. It\u2019s about the cones.\u201d\n\t\tGet our newsletter, DP Daybreak, delivered to your inbox every weekday morning.The cones are the writers, of course.

          "title": "Julia Fischer | Fact-check: \u2018Curiosity killed the cat\u2019",
          "article_content": "When I say that I\u2019m a double major and double minor, it sounds like a carefully planned achievement. But what truly brings me joy is not the accomplishment that\u2019ll go on my transcript. It\u2019s what I explain after listing my areas of study: that they came about because I went where curiosity led me.\nStarting college during the COVID-19 pandemic, the most concrete part of my experience was the academics. During those first two semesters, half of my classes were made up of the Integrated Studies Program, a requirement for Benjamin Franklin Scholars in the College of Arts and Sciences. What this really meant was that in the fall, we dissected Homer\u2019s \u201cIliad\u201d in classical studies while reading Erasmus in history. The next semester, we learned about behavior in positive psychology while attempting Jain vegetarianism as part of religious studies. More than specific topics, however, what BFS really taught me is that when it comes to separate disciplines, overlap \u2014 integration \u2014 matters more than difference.\n\t\tFrom there, the rest is history. My time in BFS cemented my decision to major in both Hispanic studies and political science. Post-ISP, I was required to take three BFS seminars. After my first, on Shakespeare, I fell in love with English and decided to complete the minor. And when I stumbled upon global medieval studies at the end of my junior year, I quickly added that minor, too.\nNone of these important academic choices were particularly strategic. I didn\u2019t take on any of my majors and minors because I thought they\u2019d look great on my transcript or help me professionally, but they\u2019ve taught me so much. They represent what college is really about: exploration. Throughout my Penn experience, my main goal has been to learn but never to force myself to be interested in areas I didn\u2019t feel genuinely curious about \u2014 at least, not beyond giving them the \u201cold college try.\u201d\u00a0\n\t\t\n\t\nTo any and all undergraduates reading, please delve into the interests you didn\u2019t have the opportunity to pursue in high school \u2014 and even if you\u2019re an upperclassman, the ones that you feel are being sparked now. Allow curiosity, not just perceived usefulness or resume bling, to dictate how you spend your time. Let it lead you both within and beyond the classroom. Spend six-plus hours per week in Charles Addams Fine Arts Hall for a drawing class. Visit Van Pelt Library and borrow more books, across genres, than you can hope to finish in an academic year. Attend talks, performances, concerts, and movies both on and off campus. Walk around inside of museums and outside in Philadelphia. And apply to work for the student newspaper \u2014 especially if, like I did, you have no prior experience.\nAs anyone who works for The Daily Pennsylvanian knows, curiosity is central to journalism. As a writer for 34th Street this year, it inspired me to cover an array of topics, from niche musical genres to public libraries. For the copy department, curiosity is uniquely crucial. In the Red Room \u2014 copy\u2019s headquarters \u2014 curiosity is expanded and focused on every single detail. A copy editor\u2019s job isn\u2019t just about fixing grammar, spelling, and style; it\u2019s also about fact-checking every statement an article makes. Often, it means dozens of open tabs, and a seven-year-old laptop\u2019s fans running louder than a jet engine (fact-checked, yes, this might be an exaggeration).\n\tCopy-editing can be exhausting. But more often, it\u2019s exhilarating. Nowhere else can I say that I\u2019ve worked on a basketball recap one minute and breaking news the next. I\u2019ve learned so much about campus happenings and culture thanks to copy. And it\u2019s also fundamentally important to publications like the DP. Professionalism, integrity, and the trust of readers rely as much on those behind the scenes as those listed in bylines. In a world where it\u2019s easier than ever to encounter misinformation, copy-editing is a service to truth-telling that\u2019s more essential than ever. And I\u2019m so proud to have been a part of it.\nTo those reading, stay informed. The fact that you\u2019re reading the DP is a great sign. Thank you for supporting student journalism. But don\u2019t allow yourself to be limited in your sources. Never be satisfied with a headline or with a single article. Click on the links your news outlets cite and venture beyond them. Fact-check where you\u2019re doubtful, and even where you\u2019re not. Read across the political spectrum. Question your own assumptions, and those any writer or editor might make \u2014 for all our hard work, journalists are still human.\nAs I wrap up, I\u2019m reminded of the many people I\u2019m grateful for. Like any good editor, I\u2019ll keep it concise. Thank you to Brittany and Sophie, my predecessors, for all your dedication and encouragement. Thank you to Allyson, for being the best co-copy editor and fellow Philadelphia sports fan. Thank you to everyone who made the Red Room warm, filled with laughter and inside jokes. And thank you to my friends and family who read everything I write and listen anytime I say a sentence \u201csounds weird.\u201d Your support means far more than I can keep within 1,000 words.\nSoon, the DP sticker on my laptop will signify my role as an alumna, not a staffer. But I\u2019ll hold on to what the DP and Penn have taught me. I\u2019ll continue to verify the truth where I can. I\u2019ll watch YouTube video essays and go down Wikipedia rabbit holes, collect fun facts and be curious about the places and people around me. And although I\u2019ll depart from my regular schedule of copy shifts, I\u2019ll keep the memories and friendships I\u2019ve made. \u00a0At the end of these four years, I guess there\u2019s one last thing to say. As I wrote many times on Slack after copy-editing articles \u2014 \u201cDone!\u201d\nJULIA FISCHER is a College senior studying political science and Hispanic studies from Virginia.

          "title": "Jesse Zhang | Cheers to never having it 'normal'",
          "article_content": "I remember the day I was admitted to Penn like it was yesterday (off the waitlist, I might add). I was home in China due to the COVID-19 pandemic, and it was four days before my high school graduation on Zoom. I breathed a sigh of relief as the sense of certainty settled in: I was finally going to have a normal college experience.But who was I kidding? My friends and I were graduating from living rooms, cars, and socially-distanced football fields. People took to the streets around the world to advocate for racial justice. And the 2020 United States presidential election, one that was as long as it was mentally tormenting, was in full swing. We all yearned for normalcy, but nothing about our lives was normal.While I had to begin my first year at Penn from my bedroom in China, I was determined to not let it diminish my experience. As such, over a Zoom meeting, I joined The Daily Pennsylvanian\u2019s multimedia department. As a staffer, I took photos in corners of my world that had any miniscule resemblance to the writers\u2019 experience in America. My first big assignment came when former photo editor Sukhmani Kaur asked me to stay up all night and edit photos as they rolled in on Election Day. What kind of first year gives up a night of sleep for a little club assignment? Not normal.Though my journey at the DP started with me completing one assignment every two weeks, I would have never foreseen how it would come to define my time at Penn.Being photo editor in 2022 allowed me to further see Penn through my camera lens. I skipped classes and meals to follow former Penn President Liz Magill to all corners of campus during the first 100 days of her tenure. I negotiated with the Secret Service to allow our own photography equipment into a campaign event with President Joe Biden and former President Barack Obama. I drove a group of photographers home at 4 a.m. after Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro and Dr. Mehmet Oz\u2019s respective election night parties. Normal? Hardly.As president in 2023, I would go on to sign my name on the dotted line and initiate the purchase of a permanent home for the DP. Our team weathered a pivotal chapter in Penn\u2019s history which culminated in the resignation of University leaders. In those months, I woke up to dozens of hate emails in my inbox every day, and our reporters worked around the clock to keep up with national news organizations which possessed more manpower and resources.\u00a0One of the copy editors on the 139th board, Allyson Nelson, quipped of the news cycle at Penn as \u201cwhen it rains, it pours.\u201d As fun (and often exhausting) as it was to spend an ungodly amount of time in our infamously windowless office and eat countless Zesto\u2019s pizzas, I also realized how abnormal of a collegiate experience it was. I was missing out on weeknight hangouts with friends, happy hours during restaurant week, formals, parties, and other archetypes of a \u201cnormal\u201d college experience. For the first two and a half of my three in-person years, my friends have considerately learned to not schedule dinners with me on weeknights.Not normal! (Shoutout to my friends for putting up with me).Though as time went on, I grew to love the abnormality. Reporting taught me how to work with tight deadlines and competing priorities. Photographing protests showed me the importance of connecting with different communities. Leading a team through crises challenged my empathy, grit, and social consciousness. The abnormality presented me with a unique skill set and undoubtedly shaped my character. Above all, I loved how it strengthened my optimism and resilience.Or maybe it\u2019s because I loved giving people ridiculous reasons on why I cannot make lunch: \u201cI HAVE TO go to the airport and photograph Air Force One.\u201dI am acutely aware of the fact that my sense of abnormality is not unique. In many ways, the normalcy the Class of 2024 yearned for at the start of our college years never arrived. While we no longer have to wear masks in classrooms or get swabbed twice a week in a giant air-ventilated tent, we are in the midst of another pivotal U.S. presidential election. We are having unprecedented discussions regarding First Amendment rights on college campuses, and our communities are feeling the inevitable ripples of conflicts across the world.Rather than letting these challenges loom over our impending graduation, we should consider the opportunities that they present. We are uniquely positioned to speak out about issues close to our hearts, have constructive conversations on the most contentious topics of the day, and act to improve the community around us.While the COVID-19 pandemic put in-person socializing on hold, we learned how to forge connections and friendships through screens. We saw the importance of becoming more self-educated and practicing our civic duties during the Black Lives Matter movement and the 2020 elections. Not since the civil rights movement and Vietnam anti-war protests of the 1960s has so much media attention been dedicated to college campuses across the country, and we must use what we learned from the abnormality of our college experience to rise up to the challenge.Between our myriads of farewell toasts, I realize that what began as a quest for normalcy evolved into an embrace of abnormality. Our college graduation is hardly the ultimate epilogue; it is merely the cliffhanger to the rest of our lives. The abnormality we saw throughout our time in college will undoubtedly change the ways in which we can and will approach the world. So in all the ways we are celebrating the Class of 2024 this graduation season, here\u2019s cheers to the abnormality that made us one of a kind.JESSE ZHANG is a Wharton senior studying business economics and public policy and marketing from Shenzhen, China.

          "article_content": "I remember when I first watched your white net snap taut from a goal scored. Seeing the plus one on the scoreboard felt just like that rush I feel when the music is perfect and I row into top gear. I knew I\u2019d return for the next few matches at home. Even when the evening trains would rumble across the bridge behind Rhodes Field, and their terrific chug would drown out announcements of player substitutions that I really needed to hear, I was delighted I was the one to be there \u2014 soles suctioned to metal bleachers, fingers chilled stiff, and eardrums blitzed by bursts of crowd noise \u2014 to witness and write about it all.\nI loved my postgame sprints across the field to the home bench, holding two phones on record just in case one wouldn\u2019t be enough to catch every word of my interviews. I remember how the beginnings felt so unfamiliar, meeting and asking questions to names I'd already scrutinized from stat sheets and rosters. But any nerves sank when I remembered how much fun it was to talk about you.\n\t\tI loved watching all the ways you could move. Heels anchored into grass and how spines would pivot, or squeaks of sneakers on glossy hardwood below century-old Palestra rafters. I loved how it would all happen so fast. A baton pass as fluid as turning a page of a book, or the ferocious swings of rackets and sticks and bats to mash a bulleting ball. I sought the best words to capture you on the page.\nYou showed no fear and I wanted to feel that way, too. So I plunged into your momentum and kept up. I studied score sheets and rosters like homework. I squinted across courts and fields; memorized the numbers on players\u2019 backs until I could predict the timings of coaches\u2019 substitutions. I loved catching you off-guard to hear my favorite response: \u201cThat\u2019s a great question.\u201d And when anyone would begin to explain to me the game I knew I loved, I learned to straighten my shoulders and interrupt.\n\t\t\n\t\nI spent some years matching your pace. In return, you drew some of the best words out of me. Watching my bylines stack was a thrill I\u2019d share constantly with home, and it felt unreal to think how many people would read my work the next day. But you are rapid. Your routines kept rolling, and my writing grew mechanic. Obligations heaped. Your schedules began to weigh like an anchor on my joy, and what I had feared most would happen finally caught up to flatten my spirit: I grew tired.\nBut I wasn\u2019t tired of you. I will always love being obsessed with you. ESPN still overwhelms my notifications, and I\u2019ll hopefully watch you in a London stadium soon. Maybe I grew tired of knowing you so hard. Making my living in this city became an urgent test, and I rationed my time to be able to live. I didn\u2019t want you to feel like work, too.\n\tI wondered what kind of writer you wanted me to be. What it takes to be the first to break news, to understand every sport as much as my favorite, to learn generations of legendary names I didn\u2019t grow up with. I watched those around me do it excellently. I wondered if we all shared the same amount of hours. But reality had crashed into me like a wave, and when I finally learned how to keep my chin above the surface, I found no energy left to write you in my best words anymore.\nI remember on another sunny afternoon at work, while rolling crates of silverware and counting down my hours on the clock, I watched you through a dim, cracked phone screen showing the 2022 World Cup. At every goal scored, I could hear the roar of cheers from the opposite side of the kitchen pass \u2014 occasionally delayed, but nevertheless electric, even through the brunch noise. Here was that delight, again, in a place I didn\u2019t expect. I thought about the stories I had wanted to share when I first began writing. And watching you through a smaller screen, I wondered if my distance from your bigger headlines demanded something much greater than what I could give \u2014 a distance I wasn\u2019t confident I could close.\u00a0\nSo call me lazy or stale, unambitious at most. But I felt happy when I went to a soccer game with nothing to write. This wasn\u2019t work, but a passion enjoyed. No deadline to race, no weaving of nuanced questions for interviews, nor a fiery stance on zonal marking versus man-to-man to prove I know what I\u2019m talking about. I stood in the stands as just a fan of you. I rooted for a side, ignored the names of away team substitutions, and the delight of you returned.\nI couldn\u2019t become that trailblazer you craved. But now I\u2019ll settle for the gallery afar, watching you continue to flourish for your favorite kind of crowd. So let me flourish, too. I won\u2019t give all my words to you anymore \u2014 even if everything about you seemed so ideal in those evening hours, when the sun would set over the Schuylkill as the timeclock inched down, and the players on the field continued to just run, chasing you and one another into the back of that white net, and I was the one there to write about it all. You were a thrill unmatched, even as my own feet stood still. So perhaps I'll return to you sometime soon, when I've grown a little more in myself, and my view from the stands calls again to spill out into words.\nESTHER LIM is a College senior studying English with a concentration in creative writing from Georgia.

          "article_content": "If you\u2019re reading this self-serving trip down memory lane, you might be one of my friends and family. Or, more likely, you\u2019re trying to read about the encampment and got lost on The Daily Pennsylvanian\u2019s website.\nIf you\u2019re in the latter camp, just hit the menu button on the top left and go to news. And if you\u2019re reading this in the physical paper \u2026 Who am I kidding, nobody actually picks up one of those. But if you\u2019re one of my friends and family, I\u2019m going to tell a story you might have already heard. Bear with me.\n\t\tWhile I was sports editor, a group of us made the seven-hour commute to Hanover, N.H., to cover a football game at Dartmouth College. At the time, we did a \u201cPicks are In\u201d column, where we\u2019d predict each week\u2019s game. All but one of our writers picked Dartmouth, who were 11.5-point favorites.\u00a0\nCut to: Penn somehow wins in double overtime, I\u2019m in the process of writing what will become an extremely mediocre recap, and we\u2019re sitting in a nearly empty press conference waiting to speak to Penn\u2019s coach.\n\t\t\n\t\nOne of us eventually asked him, \u201cWhat message do you think this win sends to the rest of the Ivy League?\u201d While staring directly at us, he said, \u201cI don\u2019t think anyone gave us a chance today... People were writing stories without giving us Quakers a chance. So message: We are 3-0, ready to play another game next week.\u201d\u00a0\nI checked. We were the only ones that had written a word about this game.\n\tWe, a group of 20-year-olds, had published something that pissed off a Division I football coach, and when we were proven wrong, he rightly told us to our faces.\nIt was completely fair for him \u2014 who, I should mention, is a very nice guy \u2014 to call us out. And it gets at a key aspect of college sports journalism: It can be very bizarre.\u00a0\nOne time, I was covering a road football game from my room. I watched the game on TV, and a buddy of mine came in and watched with me. With 10 minutes to go, we were talking about a Penn running back that was tearing through Cornell\u2019s defense.\n\u201cOh yeah,\u201d I said. \u201cI'll probably talk to him.\u201d\nI was on the phone with the running back a little over 10 minutes later. As my friend sat bemused on my couch, the guy who just charged through linemen on my TV was on the phone with me so I could mumble disjointed questions at him.\nAgain, bizarre.\nFormer Sports Editor Brandon Pride and I once traveled to New York for a baseball series at Columbia University. In the second game of the series, Penn blew a six-run lead in the last couple innings and lost on a walk-off homer.\nRough way to lose. And rough for Brandon and me, who now had to talk to the coach about their collapse.\u00a0\nWe waited as the team emerged from the dugout, terrified of having to confront a coach whose team just lost in the worst way imaginable. As he came out, we told him who we were, and he quickly exclaimed, \u201cOh wow, thanks for coming out, guys!\u201d and couldn\u2019t have been any nicer.\nYou never know what to expect from the people you\u2019re interviewing. Like how you don\u2019t expect Rick Pitino to tell you and the rest of a cramped postgame press conference about how the NCAA got its comeuppance in his infamous \u201cladies of the night\u201d investigation.\nBut that\u2019s part of what makes this very specific brand of journalism so great, and the memories I have from it are some of the best from my time in college.\nAfter that Dartmouth game, we drove 45 minutes in the middle of the night to a place called \u201cD Acres Permaculture Farm & Educational Homestead.\u201d\nIf that sounds like it\u2019s not a luxury hotel, you would be correct. I\u2019d waited till the last couple days before our trip to book a hotel. Much to my surprise, it was Family Weekend at Dartmouth, which meant that all the hotels in Hanover were full. The only one available was D Acres, located more or less in the middle of nowhere.\u00a0\nIt was cheap, so D Acres had that going for it.\nWe drove up around midnight to what looked like a haunted house, unsure if we\u2019d end up sleeping in the car. To our surprise, it was actually quite nice. The room next to the kitchen was for butchering pigs, and you needed to pay with quarters to shower. But the beds were comfy, and we weren\u2019t in a tent like the website suggested we might be.\nFor less than $60 a person, it was a good value. Plus, like many trips, it was a night with friends that I\u2019ll never forget.\n\n\n\n\n                Photos courtesy of Matthew Frank\n      \n\n\nI\u2019ve written over 120 articles for the DP (yikes), and although a couple of those were actually pretty good, it\u2019s the memories and the friends that I\u2019ll be most proud of and thankful for about my time in DPOSTM (The DP\u2019s Only Section That Matters, for the uninformed).\nI\u2019m thankful for the guys on Sunday Shift\u2122, for being the only reason I\u2019d ever wake up before noon on a Sunday. And Jonah and the other non-DPOSTMites who made late nights in the office not so miserable.\u00a0\n\t\tGet our newsletter, DP Daybreak, delivered to your inbox every weekday morning.I\u2019m appreciative of my non-DP friends, for constantly putting up with my \u201cSorry, I can\u2019t.

          "title": "Fiona Miller | Ambitions, amnesia, and ambivalence",
          "article_content": "When senior spring rolled around, a warning email from Career Advising landed in my inbox. URGENT. Apparently, my current enrollments would not complete my degree requirements. Apparently, I wouldn\u2019t graduate. As always, procrastination came back to bite me.\n\u201cSocial Impact and Responsibility: Foundations\u201d: the last class I needed to complete my concentration. As the name suggests, the course was meant to be entry-level, taken at the beginning of my academic journey, not at the tail end. Every semester, I pushed this three-hour seminar off. I could push it off no longer.\n\t\tAfter an email with my advisor, who not-so-politely suggested that I should have planned my course load better, I finally enrolled in Social Impact Foundations during my senior spring. A three-hour seminar, a foundations course as a senior \u2014 I couldn\u2019t wait.\nThe first assignment for the cursed course \u2014 which, due to my late enrollment, would be submitted well past the due date \u2014 was a legacy paper. In 2050, when you look back at your life (both personal and professional) what will you consider to be your main achievement \u2014 your legacy?\u00a0\nTo some, this assignment would kindly be referred to as easy and unkindly referred to as busy work. To a senior soon to be facing the real world, legacy was terrifying. All that mattered was what immediately lied in front of me: graduating, getting a job, getting into law school. I was too young to think about myself at age 48, and it was way too early to cement my legacy.\nLegacy? So terrified by this word, I had actually enrolled in and immediately dropped this course a year prior. Now, I was backed into a corner and forced to face my legacy head-on. I debated dropping my concentration entirely, but that meant admitting defeat to my concentration advisor. So I stayed in the course, mostly out of stubbornness and partly out of spite.\u00a0\n\tI began thinking back to the dreams I wrote about in my college application. Who was I when I came here?\nAt 18, I told my dad I wasn\u2019t applying to Penn. Why bother if there was no chance I would get in? In southwest Virginia, most of my peers would stay in-state or head down to Southeastern Conference schools. No one from my area had been to Penn in recent years; Philadelphia was a strange new land.\u00a0\nMy dad disagreed. Spoken like a recreational soccer coach, he replied: \u201cYou miss 100% of the shots you don\u2019t take.\u201d The what-ifs loomed too large to brush off. Hours before the deadline, I submitted my Wharton application. When decision day rolled around, my family and I jumped up and down in excitement \u2014 not over an acceptance, but over a spot on the waitlist. My shot in the dark was met with a wait and see, a more favorable outcome than a rejection. By a mix of luck, chance, and the rise of COVID-19 gap years, I was ultimately accepted. And with the payment of my deposit, Pandora\u2019s box was opened.\nAt 18, I knew all the numbers about Penn: rankings, post-graduate outcomes, CU limits, and course requirements. Over time, numbers became my litmus test. Numbers assured me I was on the right track. Apply for five clubs, like everyone else. Apply for dozens and dozens of internships, like everyone else. Stop sleeping eight hours a night \u2014 no one else does.\nEach year, the numbers told me there was more I could do. Another club, another leadership position, a more challenging minor, a more challenging career. Each NSO, I felt like Sisyphus, with any progress I made erased by another tick of the clock. The numbers stretched on. Better to have two internship offers than one, better to have three leadership positions than two, better to have four A\u2019s than three A minuses\u2026\u00a0\nLiving by the numbers was no way to live. Constantly comparing myself to my successful classmates was productive to no one and crippling to myself. At some point \u2014 far too late in my college career \u2014 I stopped trying to fit a standard I didn\u2019t believe in. Far too late, I resuscitated my ambitions from amnesia.\u00a0\nFlashing forward, I returned to the legacy paper. I knew the sources of my unhappiness at Penn. I knew I hated the numbers, the never-ending comparisons. Most importantly, I knew who I didn\u2019t want to be. For now, that could be enough. I wrote the legacy paper. I stayed in the three-hour seminar. I will graduate with the concentration that I applied to Penn with.\u00a0\n\t\tGet our newsletter, DP Daybreak, delivered to your inbox every weekday morning.As seniors know, much of spring term is reminiscing and remembering: thinking back to first-year roommates, old friend groups, long-abandoned majors and minors, and pre-professional tracks. The legacy paper, the bane of my existence, forced me to look both backwards and forwards. The assignment made me face uncomfortable questions of \u201cWhat does success mean to you?\u201d and \u201cWho even are you, really?\u201d\u00a0\nLike most seniors, I don\u2019t really know the answers. I am graduating with a degree that claims I know something when really, I feel more confused than I did at 18. But if four years at Penn has taught me anything, it\u2019s this: Comparison is truly the thief of joy. The only thing comparison has taught me is who I don\u2019t want to be.\u00a0\nFIONA MILLER is a Wharton senior studying behavioral economics and social impact from Roanoke, Va.

          "article_content": "\u201c5 Fun Things To Do in Philadelphia,\u201d read the subject line of my most recent email.\u00a0\nSitting in my childhood bedroom back in 2020, I curiously pondered over this random email that landed in my inbox. With no connection to the city, I didn\u2019t understand why this was relevant to me. I almost ignored it, if not for my superwoman of a mother who reminded me that I was still on Penn\u2019s waitlist. I had previously concluded that Penn was no longer a possibility, but thankfully, my mom urged me to check the portal anyway.\u00a0\n\t\tMy screen was adorned with red and blue confetti \u2014 I had, in fact, been accepted to Penn. After re-reading the acceptance letter about 15 times to make sure my eyes were not deceiving me, my heart sank when I noticed the date. I was accepted over a week prior, but I had no idea because I missed the original email notification.\u00a0\nIf I had not seen the subsequent email advertising Philadelphia\u2019s main attractions, I may have missed the deadline to make an enrollment decision, or I may have never even known that I got into Penn. I was so grateful to still have the chance to attend this prestigious university despite being so irresponsible, and I made a promise to take advantage of every opportunity this school offered.\u00a0\n\t\t\n\t\nAnd that I did.\u00a0\nMy Penn experience has been nothing short of fulfilling. Though my first year was characterized by measures of isolation (virtual classes, mandatory masks, grab-and-go dining), I had never felt more connected with others. Call it trauma bonding, but there is something unifying about being a \u201cCOVID freshman\u201d that only the Class of 2024 could ever understand.\n\tMy first year was also the time when I joined The Daily Pennsylvanian as an opinion columnist, and over the next four years, I would write, edit, podcast, and even create crossword puzzles. I learned how to navigate ruthless backlash from readers attacking my character and my intellect, and I served as a deputy editor during one of the most polarizing times in DP history \u2014 two formative experiences that have shaped who I am as a person and a writer. I credit the DP for planting the seeds of my future in journalism, and I would not have had the privilege of working for NBC News, CNN, and ABC News without my roots here.\u00a0\nAside from the career benefits, writing for the DP also presented opportunities to unravel years of internalized racism. My articles about Asian hate and xenophobia in Congress may not seem significant to the average reader, but this represented a huge step forward in not only accepting my racial identity, but being proud to publicly defend it. Coming from a predominantly white neighborhood and high school, I never truly felt comfortable in my own skin and even cringed at my culture. I am ashamed to admit this now, but I sought to assimilate by subconsciously surrounding myself with white friends, American cuisine, and white norms.\u00a0\nWhile this may sound like an absurd paradox, joining a sorority further prompted me to embrace my Asian identity. I began to see Asian women engaging in social endeavors and being welcomed in spaces that I had previously assumed were exclusive to white individuals. And though Greek life undoubtedly has a litany of faults in regards to diversity and inclusion, I do credit Penn\u2019s chapter of Alpha Phi for providing my first friendships with girls that actually looked like me. I have had some of the deepest conversations with these women regarding shared backgrounds, childhood similarities, and generational differences \u2014 topics that I never even fathomed to touch on beforehand.\u00a0\nThese social interactions remain my most treasured takeaway from college. Of course, all the sweaty frat basements, overpriced downtown events, and BYO dinners are core memories in my Penn experience. But rather than reminiscing about these drunken nights, I am more proud of the friendships that these social outings have rewarded me with. I have met my best friends that know me better than I know myself, some of whom I would quite literally consider to be family. I have learned about love and loyalty, support and sacrifice, trauma and tragedy.\nMy friends have also inspired me in a myriad of ways, and I\u2019ll never tire of watching them launch companies, save lives, and change the world. They dedicate their hearts and souls to every endeavor, including athletics, the arts, and other extracurricular activities. In fact, witnessing my peers\u2019 passions has served to revitalize my own. As a competitive figure skater for over 12 years who suffered from burnout and grew to despise the sport, I refused to step foot on the ice again. Though I joined the Penn Figure Skating Club during the fall of my first year, it was not until senior spring (seven semesters later) that I visited the Penn Ice Rink for the very first time. I regret how long it has taken, but it has been a beautiful journey receiving such profound support and falling back in love with the sport that defined me for over a decade.\u00a0\n\t\tGet our newsletter, DP Daybreak, delivered to your inbox every weekday morning.I could go on and on about the many things that Penn has taught me, but my mind always goes back to the day I discovered my Penn acceptance and the panic that ensued after realizing I opened the letter a week late. I often think about how different my life would have been had I continued to neglect my inbox, and I always come to the same conclusion: none of these experiences would have been the same, and many of these life lessons may have never come to fruition.\u00a0\nSo if there\u2019s one piece of advice I have to give, it is to check your email.

          "article_content": "Opinion applications for The Daily Pennsylvanian were due on a rainy, pandemic-era September day. Zoning out in a Zoom lecture, I wondered if I really wanted to put the effort into penning a sample column. Wouldn\u2019t I just get rejected?\nBut then I remembered what Mr. Henderson, my high school English teacher, wrote to me that spring. He said he associated me with the newspaper, complimenting my writing style and how I gave my all on every assignment. If at least one person thought that I belonged at the paper, I may as well give it my best shot.\u00a0\n\t\tIt\u2019s a pretty solid call to adventure, don\u2019t you think?\nWhen I started writing columns, I was scared stiff of saying something that would get construed the wrong way. I reviewed every last letter and punctuation mark of my drafts, and asked my friends to do the same. With that diligence, I grew as a writer. I started speaking up in meetings, and then, in my junior year, I led them as the opinion editor.\u00a0\n\t\t\n\t\nFor the longest time, I chose to interpret my time at Penn, and at the DP, as a kind of hero\u2019s journey, where I finish demanding assignments with aplomb, and every adversity teaches me a valuable lesson. Most of us do some version of that. We hope to graduate feeling triumphant, having risen through the ranks and gained expertise in the activities and academics that we invested in. We hope that our next steps involve a dream job or school \u2014 a dream life, even.\nI entered Penn my senior fall, eager to get my storybook resolution come graduation. Leaving my summer internship with glowing reviews from my mentors, I was assured of a return offer. And having made a pact with my friends to take no more than 5.5 CUs, I would be coasting, relative to my earlier 6.5 and 7 CU terms as a dual-degree student. This was the term where, instead of learning the ropes of Penn and fighting to stay afloat, I would explore and navigate new waters.\u00a0\n\tBut then, as the clock struck midnight and September began, my email inbox greeted me with a \u201cwe regret to inform you\u201d message from the company I had interned at \u2014 the first of many, many eventful emails in my inbox. I dropped down to 4.5 CUs after struggling with a coding assignment for 20-something hours, but my workload hardly let up after that.\nOver the following months, 30 and 40-hour weeks at the DP became my norm: speaking with our (incredibly, insanely dedicated) staffers and editing and fact-checking columns. I was hopping on phone calls and writing replies to email chains, dozens of messages deep in the middle of the night. By the end of the year, Opinion published over 200 staff and guest columns with diverse perspectives on campus life and current events \u2014 there is nothing I am prouder of having worked on at Penn.\nNone of it would have been possible without the immense support and kindness from so many wonderful, driven people. Thank you Emi, Imran, and Jesse \u2014 in the most tumultuous of times in the Pink Palace, I could count on you to advocate for Opinion and to give your all into leading the DP, which means more than words can express. Thank you Yomi, Vinay, and Emily for being the absolute best deputy editors Opinion 139 could ask for, and Matteo, for your careful sensitivity reading and suggestions. Thank you Derek, Benjamin, and all of Photo and Design for the beautiful doms, and for goofing off with me during production nights. Thank you Allyson, Julia, and all of Copy! You are the backbone of the DP.\nAnd of course, I am most grateful for the wit, enthusiasm, and commitment of every single columnist I have had the privilege to work with; your stories captivated thousands of minds and inspired countless debates.\nIf I was still going after that storybook resolution, I\u2019d tell you that upon retirement from the DP, I rode off into the sunset to some magnificent end-credits-style music. At our banquet, I was honored to receive the Editor of the Year award, and after applying to full-time positions for months, I suddenly had to decide between three great job offers over the span of two weeks.\nBut it\u2019s not all that simple \u2014 I\u2019ve learned this spring that 5.5 CUs can feel just as soul-sucking as 7 (thanks, NETS 2120), and I\u2019ve had my fair share of tough conversations, embarrassing slip-ups, and everyday misfortunes. With the turmoil and tensions both on campus and worldwide right now, it feels disingenuous to tell a story where everything wraps up neatly, with no loose ends.\nI said before that in a hero\u2019s journey, each adversity teaches you a lesson \u2014 but that\u2019s not how life actually works. Sometimes, you just screw up, for no reason other than bad luck or a bout of clumsiness. Sometimes, there\u2019s no purpose to it: only pain.\nBecause of that, I\u2019ve given up on the hero\u2019s journey altogether. Shifting away from grandiose but precarious narratives that hinge on external validation, like acceptances and awards, I now prefer to focus my story on the day-to-day minutiae that bring me joy and stability. It is filled with lovely little moments, like chatting with my roommates over spicy, piping-hot bowls of instant ramen, or taking in the fresh air and ambiance as I walk through the Woodlands.\u00a0\n\t\tGet our newsletter, DP Daybreak, delivered to your inbox every weekday morning.My life feels far fuller with this type of story than when I\u2019ve tried to contort my time at Penn into a narrative with some meaningful conclusion to it all. I have flourished in many ways here. But in others, I am very much a work-in-progress, and that\u2019s perfectly fine. I hope that you will come to adapt your stories as you grow and change too \u2014 sticking with a rigid narrative for too long is no fun.\nI suppose I\u2019ll end here on the same line that got me into this whole (glorious) mess in hopes that it inspires somebody else: whoever you are, if you so desire, you can belong at the paper. Start writing stories, and never stop. Be curious and skeptical about every narrative you examine \u2014 ask lots of questions and raise objections when you see fit.

          "title": "Riane Lumer | The social clock is ticking, according to who?",
          "article_content": "Five years ago during a college tour trip, I vividly recall sitting in a hotel, gazing out the window at the skyline of Boston. I felt inspired; I was eager to write my supplemental essays about why I wanted to attend Boston College (BC), and why I wanted to become a teacher. BC\u2019s Lynch School of Education and Human Development attracted me because of its education program.\nThis tour was a few weeks before I was selected to present a speech at the back-to-school convocation in front of every K-12 teacher in the district on my passions for education and teaching. Becoming a teacher was a personality trait for me. \u201cMost likely to become part of Lower Moreland Faculty: Riane Lumer.\u201d I even won a scholarship award for someone potentially entering the field of education. \u201cWe\u2019ll be colleagues one day!\u201d my choir director constantly joked my senior year. \u201cYou\u2019ll take over the organization in the future,\u201d my Mini-THON advisor told me.\u00a0\n\t\tI had wanted to be an English teacher since I was in fifth grade \u2014 or so I thought.\nMy sophomore year at BC, I student-taught at Brighton High School, a turnaround Boston public school in Massachusetts. This was something I was itching to do throughout my first year. I just wanted to get in the classroom.\u00a0\n\t\t\n\t\nLike most city schools, students in the urban district are victims of pervasive systemic disparities that contribute to educational debt. I recognized this upon the first day of my pre-practicum and felt a need to assist on a political level. My passion for reform only intensified after more time connecting with students.\u00a0\nBut this desire extends beyond the role of a teacher. \u201cThere\u2019s only so much a teacher can do within the classroom for change,\u201d I thought to myself.\u00a0\n\tAnd so, after a month of teaching, I began to heavily question a future in it. That frightened me\u00a0\u2014 leading me to suppress these feelings until the end of the semester, when I truly began to consider that this really wasn\u2019t the path for me. I didn\u2019t want to swallow that pill. I didn\u2019t think I knew myself without it.\nI was grieving a dream that died, a future for myself that no longer matched what I had imagined for years. New experiences and exposures changed me and sparked bigger aspirations. But I also felt as though I failed myself; my family always told me teaching wasn\u2019t for me, and I thought I was rebelling. Well, they were right, but for different reasons.\u00a0\nI added a third major: political science. But I was faced with another dilemma. The licensure teaching program at BC was the last thing keeping me there. And the summer prior to that, the excitement for student-teaching and jump-starting my career in education counteracted my detached emotions toward the atmosphere of BC.\u00a0\nI applied to transfer to NYU during the spring semester of my sophomore year. I enrolled in their education school, but I didn\u2019t attend. I wanted to give BC one more shot: it was my top choice, and I wanted it to feel the way I expected. And I wanted my zeal for teaching to return, because that was all I thought I knew and was attached to. That linear path was comforting to me. It was something that I felt was within my grasp and control.\nOn May 18, 2022, I received my acceptance to Penn as a junior transfer majoring in political science. Yes, a junior transfer who also was entering with a new major that they had only taken one course for at their prior institution.\u00a0\nEmbracing my desire to transfer and reshape my career trajectory ignited my newfound eagerness to continuously explore new avenues that ignite my joy and curiosity. When I got onto Penn\u2019s campus, I applied to join The Daily Pennsylvanian\u2019s opinion and podcast departments and became a writer for 34th Street Magazine. At BC, I was involved primarily in educationally-oriented activities. It was my whole world; anything like writing for the student newspaper felt irrelevant to my future career. I was wrong and naive. And I ended up writing about it.\u00a0\nBecause of my experiences at the DP and with my journalistic writing minor, I explored the world of journalism \u2014 a discipline one of my English professors at BC suggested would be a good fit for me. But I refused to depart from what I thought was my path, until my college experience took an unexpected turn on its head.\u00a0\nCurrently, I\u2019m unsure exactly what the future holds for me, but I am learning to find peace in all of the possibilities. When I transferred, I abandoned the habit of attempting to assume control over every aspect of my life and plan each detail. Instead, I embrace the uncertainty of the future and approach my twenties as a blank canvas, ready to be painted with new experiences and opportunities.\u00a0\nMy college experience has been anything but conventional. Although I will be walking across the stage this month, I will not be officially graduating until December \u2014 another detour from what I expected when transferring to Penn and assuming I would \u201cgraduate on time.\u201d\nWhen I met with my advisor and he broke the news to me that I would not be graduating \u201con time,\u201d I panicked and my stomach dropped. Instinctively, I felt that I was falling behind. But in the aftermath of that moment, I began to question the concept of \u201con time.\u201d What does it truly mean? Especially for me? I realized that this phrase carries little significance \u2014 it's more about when things unfold as they're meant to. The right time is when it happens, and this fall, I will be embarking on another chapter by participating in the Penn in Washington program in D.C. (another transfer application bucket list item!).\u00a0\nThe social clock, a sociological theory identified by Bernice Neugarten, is a timetable of expectations for reaching milestones in your life predicated on external pressures and cultural norms embedded into societal structures. But as I have come to view it, the pressures of the social clock can seep into every level of decision-making in your life, if you allow it to sway you in determining how to act according to what you believe society would expect of you, or adhering to what others are doing around you.\u00a0\nI fell victim to this when experiencing dilemmas about my future. Now, I check myself as I fall into its harmful cycles time and time again. During rush, girls consistently asked me what post-grad job I had lined up or where I would be living. I didn\u2019t know, but I was no longer embarrassed. Everyone has their own timelines, and we are all working to figure them out. The rigorous, hyper-competitive nature of Penn especially subscribes to the demands of the social clock, so beware.\u00a0\nI find that the best way to withdraw yourself from this phenomenon is to know yourself. To listen to yourself. I encourage you to ask yourself, who are you? What sparks your curiosity? What excites you? What makes you tick? Are you driven by passions you have developed, or are you driven to fit the mold of what you think society expects of you?\u00a0\nAs I write this on my last day of classes at Penn, I sit at my desk reflecting on the past two years of my journey while a mug gifted from Penn\u2019s Transfer Student Organization to seniors sits next to my computer reading, \u201cI survived transferring.\u201d\u00a0\n\t\tGet our newsletter, DP Daybreak, delivered to your inbox every weekday morning.Yes, I did. But more importantly, I've transformed into a person I never envisioned \u2014\u00a0I was so overly fixated on preserving what felt safe and comfortable that I lost sight of who I was actually evolving into. \u00a0\nI leave with a reminder to my future self and to all of you: It's okay to outgrow places, people, things, habits, visions, or worldviews. Don't feel guilty about change and growth \u2014 untether yourself as you enter into new phases.

          "article_content": "Of the dozens of campus tours I\u2019ve given for the Kite and Key Society, each one has been different. I\u2019d switch out old stories for new ones or change how I\u2019d present information to prospective students and their families. The start of my tours, however, always remained the same:\n\"Penn was founded in 1740 by Benjamin Franklin. He was a founding father of the United States, printer, inventor, and so much more. Franklin didn\u2019t like to be defined by just one thing, and that\u2019s the spirit we love to embody through interdisciplinary experiences here at Penn.\"\n\t\tI said these lines almost every week for my three years as a tour guide, yet I never thought of internalizing them myself. Even though I had varying interests both inside and outside of the classroom, I defined my identity as the girl who worked for The Daily Pennsylvanian for the majority of my time as a Penn student.\nThe DP was the first organization that I joined at Penn. As a lonely first-year student going stir-crazy in my bedroom due to the COVID-19 pandemic, I elected to join a club during my spring semester to give myself something to do outside of my schoolwork. After aimlessly scrolling through the Penn Clubs website, I stumbled upon the DP\u2019s page. My high school didn\u2019t have a newspaper, so I was weary of writing. But I\u2019ve always loved grammar. Thus, my love of copy editing was born.\n\t\t\t\tSEE MORE FROM ALLYSON NELSON:\ufeffPenn softball swept by Harvard'A perfect fit': Penn softball's Megan Huang is off to a strong startEverything after that point was a blur. I entered the DP\u2019s Pink Palace for the first time when COVID-19 restrictions were lifted, learned the intricacies of fact-checking and style editing, and realized that I was part of something much bigger than myself. I sought leadership as soon as I was able, and before I knew it, my entire world revolved around the DP.\nI prioritized the DP above all else. I\u2019d push off assignments to edit articles, tune out in class to look over a breaking story and cancel plans with friends to take on extra DP work. Even as a deputy copy editor, the DP was a full-time job. And when I finally became one of the two head copy editors on the 139th Board, I felt like I was always working overtime. If I wasn\u2019t actively editing, I was thinking about the DP. I kept my phone on me at all times, anxious that a breaking story would suddenly come through and I\u2019d need to edit at a moment\u2019s notice.\n\tIt slowly dawned on me after my first semester as copy editor that this life was no longer sustainable. The DP was negatively impacting my academic life, personal relationships, and mental health, and there was only so much more I could handle. Coinciding with the fact that I had just been elected summer executive editor \u2014 meaning I hadn\u2019t taken any extended time off from the DP in two years \u2014 I knew that I needed change. So what did I do? I accepted leadership positions in other clubs alongside my work at the DP.\nTo the naked eye, this decision seemed insane. But what I realized in my first semester as copy editor is that I didn\u2019t know how to tell the DP no. I took on work that I didn\u2019t have to simply because I didn\u2019t have a reason not to. With new responsibilities elsewhere on campus, particularly with Kite and Key and Social Planning and Events Committee Connaissance, I learned that it was okay to take time away from the DP to pursue other opportunities that excited me. These leadership roles taught me how to manage over 100 people, plan large-scale events, and work with major Penn offices, which is something I did not have the ability to do at the DP.\nThis was one of the best decisions I\u2019ve ever made at Penn. Finding other communities on campus made me realize how much I loved the DP. That\u2019s not to say that my other communities were lesser than \u2014 they certainly weren\u2019t \u2014 but taking a step back from the DP allowed me to appreciate the work that I was beginning to resent. I didn\u2019t always groan when a new article to edit was sent to me, nor would I dread having to go into the office. For the first time in a while, I was excited about the DP.\nThis new perspective allowed me to grow even closer with my DP community. My love had never waivered for them before, but my changed outlook made me appreciate their support so much more. It takes a village to keep the DP going, and I am so grateful that I got to work alongside some of the most passionate and motivated people at Penn.\nJulia was the best co-copy editor I could ask for, and our work would not have been possible without the dedication of our wonderful copy deputies \u2014 Charlotte, Diamy, Eleanor, Laura, Maddie, and Riley \u2014 and our equally amazing copy associates. Emi, Imran, and Walden were such strong leaders throughout my time on board, and they believed in me when I could not believe in myself. I am also thankful for Alexis and Caleb, the 139 sports editors, who welcomed me with open arms when I wanted to give sports writing a try as a junior.\n\t\tGet our newsletter, DP Daybreak, delivered to your inbox every weekday morning.My time at the DP would not have been possible without the people who came before me. I am grateful for my copy editor predecessors, Brittany and Sophie, and am also thankful for Delaney, Jonah, and Tyler, who started as my mentors but ended up becoming my closest friends.\nI always ended my tours by saying that if I had to go through the college application process 100 times over, I\u2019d still choose Penn every time. The same goes for the DP. My time in the Pink Palace taught me to be detail-oriented, how to work under pressure, compromise with people who you may not agree with, and \u2014 most importantly \u2014 the difference between an em-dash and an en-dash. Despite the bumps in the road, I\u2019m so glad that the DP was the headline of my Penn experience \u2014 even if it took me time to appreciate it fully.\nALLYSON NELSON is a College senior studying English and American history from Philadelphia.

          "title": "Tulia Falleti | The aftermath I had feared is here",
          "article_content": "Guest columnist Tulia Falleti writes to resign from the position of Chair of the Faculty Senate.Early on the morning of May 10, in less than one hour, the Philadelphia police removed the Gaza Solidarity Encampment protesters from the College Green of our campus. Penn students, staff, and faculty, with their hands zip-tied behind their backs, were separated one by one from those embracing them as they sat on the ground or locked arms around the iconic Ben Franklin statue. Not a punch or a rock was thrown; no one so much as spat.\u00a0\nSince April 25, as Chair of the Faculty Senate, I have observed the encampment, walking by its perimeter several times a day. It was a peaceful protest. I wrote so in a guest column published in The Daily Pennsylvanian on May 4, and I stand by my assessment. On May 6, during one of my visits to the perimeter of the encampment, I noticed a person standing behind the white board that announced the events for the day. I entered the encampment a few feet to read the back of the white board. Listed there were 14 \u201cCommunity Guidelines and Principles.\u201d Number 10 read: \u201cDo not engage with counter-protesters or bad-faith agitators.\u201d\u00a0\n\t\tDuring the two weeks of the encampment, despite events of individualized harassment and intimidation against protesters that were reported to the Penn police and to the Committee on Open Expression, protesters remained non-violent. The speed with which the police were able to dismantle the protest is itself evidence of the protesters\u2019 refusal to resort to violence. Members of our community who characterize chants, signs, flags, even graffiti (which our student protesters covered and asked to be removed) or paint on our beloved founder Ben Franklin\u2019s statue as forms of violence need to turn on their TVs and tune in to violent protests or war scenes from around the world. We can certainly talk about symbolic violence or of hurtful forms of expression, but no one in our campus can say that the encampment that was on College Green from April 25 until this morning \u2014 and that included not only Penn members but also members of the larger Philadelphia community \u2014 has caused any physical harm or physical violence.\u00a0\nThe encampment grew on the evening of May 8, which was of great concern to me. In a worldwide, student-led social movement, in which the encampment \u2014 i.e. peaceful protest with tents \u2014 is a strategy for protest or part of its main repertoire, its modus operandi, and is the only bargaining power that protesters have, the growth of the encampment\u2019s footprint could only indicate one reality: negotiations with the University administration were not progressing. Was the University negotiating in good faith and with respect for the student protesters as our former President Sheldon Hackney had done when negotiating divestment from South Africa in the early 1980s? I could not tell. Did the encampment occupy part of our University\u2019s lawns? Yes, a tiny fraction of those campus properties on which the institution does not pay property taxes and which expand over a significant part of West Philadelphia. Was it disruptive to our educational mission? No, it was not. The building closest to the encampment, College Hall, is under construction, and as of May 1, there are no more classes on campus. Van Pelt Library is across from the encampment, but even when the chants were at some of their highest volume, our students were studying undisturbed in the library. Students also took graduation photos around the encampment, both in front of College Hall and at the Button and the LOVE statue. It was only on the evenings of May 8 (when negotiations had stopped) and May 9 and this morning that university operations were interrupted as the University prepared to clear the encampment. Had the University taken a different approach, our educational activities and access to buildings would have continued uninterrupted.\u00a0\n\t\t\n\t\nI was ending my first year of high school when the last military dictatorship came to an end in my native Argentina. The following year, with my fellow high-school students, we were able to do what the generation before ours could not: We could go into the streets and protest, and we could also occupy our buildings in protest. The generation before mine had been arrested, killed, and disappeared for protesting \u2014 even when the cause was free public transit rides for students. Thanks to our newly regained democracy, my classmates and I could join almost weekly protests in support of democracy, of human rights, of justice, or workers\u2019 rights. And our sit-ins and building occupations always ended with good faith negotiations, never by force. Those were formative political experiences that shaped my future civic and political life and oriented me toward becoming a social scientist and an educator.\u00a0\nToday, I am heartbroken that my university, the institution where I have taught, carried out my research, and worked in service of our students, staff, and faculty in myriad ways for over twenty years, has decided to send in the police to arrest its own students, staff, and faculty. I have been asked if I would hold the same position if the protesters were part of a worldwide encampment movement that was pro-abortion or against immigration. My answer is unequivocally \u201cYes!\u201d I would defend and uphold their right to peacefully protest, because this is a fundamental bedrock right of democracy. The fact that this protest \u2014 like the Occupy Wall Street or the rent protest movements before \u2014 used tents should have led our university community to talk about our land, how we occupy it, how it is taxed (or not) by our city, how it serves our mission, and how we use it. At this precise moment, in fact, the construction work that is going on around College Hall has occupied a larger footprint of our College Green area than the encampment did. Moreover, unlike other universities that use their main green area for graduation, we hold our convocations and graduations in our football stadium, so there was no reason to rush to remove the encampment as the semester came to an end and graduation was due to take place in ten days and over two blocks from College Green. The fact that there were Penn students, staff, and faculty complaining about speech content should have led to discussions about free speech, not censorship. And the fact that order is \u201crestored\u201d by sacrificing rights to free speech and to non-violent protest is exactly what autocracies around the world do now and what dictatorships have done throughout history to repress civic movements and suppress rights. Moreover, the decision itself is shortsighted. The encampment can be removed today, but the worldwide student-led movement will not end.\u00a0\n\tAccording to our rules, as Chair of the Faculty Senate I was not elected but appointed instead by a small Nominating Committee of nine peers. This undemocratic process notwithstanding, I am confident that by upholding our rules and procedures, I could have continued to strive to represent the vast majority of the members of the standing faculty at Penn. For instance, our Senate Executive Committee agreed yesterday to encourage \u201cboth\u00a0the\u00a0administration\u00a0and\u00a0the negotiating team of the student-led movement\u00a0to\u00a0keep\u00a0negotiating\u00a0in\u00a0good\u00a0faith, to de-escalate, and to seek a peaceful resolution.\u201d I would have been thrilled to carry that message if there was anyone to hear it today. I am, however, no longer confident of my ability to work collaboratively with our administration that has sent in the police to arrest its own students, staff, and faculty for participating in a non-violent protest. Thus, I am hereby presenting my resignation as Chair of the Faculty Senate of the University of Pennsylvania.\u00a0\nAs a member of the standing faculty, I will continue to defend academic freedom, free speech, and due process at our university. After serving as Chair-elect and then Chair of the Faculty Senate during the last two years, I am more aware and cognizant than ever of our Faculty Handbook, our Statutes of the Trustees (in particular, Article 11), our essential Guidelines on Open Expression, our carefully structured disciplinary processes for students, our need for academic freedom, and the importance of our shared governance. I am also keenly aware of the challenges that our University has faced in the last year and that are of public knowledge. As two colleagues have recently argued, our University\u2019s rules have been written in times of calm to be applied in times of upheaval. As a faculty member, I will make every effort to ensure that our rules and procedures are followed without bias and without manipulation. That our students, staff, and faculty are treated fairly. If universities such as Penn become one-sided, partisan, and biased, if they give in to external pressures for either political or financial reasons, then there is no hope for higher education in this country or the world. The larger threat is to democracy itself, because such manipulation of our rules, policies, and procedures can only take place in non-democratic institutions.\u00a0\nI leave my leadership role in the Faculty Senate with the following unsolicited words of advice to our administration, our Trustees, our boards\u2019 advisors, and to my fellow colleagues. It comes from our students: \u201cWe commit to assuming the best intentions, granting ourselves and others grace when mistakes are made and approaching conflict with the goal of addressing, repairing, and restoring.\u201d (Guideline number eight of the Penn encampment disbanded today.) May I have the wisdom of our students and future leaders to live up to this principle in the weeks and months to come, given the mistakes committed at Penn today.\u00a0\nTULIA FALLETI is a professor of political science and the former chair of the Faculty Senate.

          "title": "George Honig | It was a mistake to send in the police to end the encampment",
          "article_content": "As an alumnus of Penn, I received communication from the University a few days ago regarding the removal by Penn Police in riot gear (with the assistance of the Philadelphia Police Department) of the encampment of students protesting Israel's violations of the human rights of Palestinians in Gaza. The University's actions have not been fair or even-handed to these students, and I believe the administration is on the wrong side of history. \u00a0\nIn my view, the students\u2019 demands have been reasonable and just, as this war shows no signs of ending. On Oct. 7, a Hamas raid (which I have condemned) killed 1,100 Israelis. Today, Israel's eight-month military operations have killed 40,000 people, displaced nearly 2 million, and destroyed more than 50% of the buildings in Gaza. What Israel has done is not justice or defense, but rather barbarism and immorality by the standards of the Jewish, Christian, or Muslim religions, or by any reasonable standard of international law. It is for this reason that the International Court of Justice has allowed a case for genocide to proceed against Israel. \u00a0\n\t\tI was especially appalled that dozens of Penn faculty members traveled to Israel in January and met with Israeli President Isaac Herzog, who is specifically mentioned in the International Court of Justice finding. This is equivalent to a faculty member meeting with Vladimir Putin or Slobodan Milo\u0161evi\u0107. I cannot believe that any Arab, Palestinian, or Muslim student could think that they would be treated fairly by these faculty.\nTo say that Penn has been even-handed in its dealings with pro-Israeli and pro-Palestinian students is demonstrably false. Shortly after Oct. 7, Penn convened an antisemitism task force, which was done in partnership with the American Jewish Committee, and we have received continuous communication about this committee. I call on Penn to immediately establish a task force to specifically address Islamophobia and anti-Arab and anti-Palestinian racism on campus, and that this task force work in cooperation with the Council on American-Islamic Relations and the American-Arab Anti-Discrimination Committee. \u00a0\n\t\t\n\t\nI also call on Penn to evaluate investments in any activity which may violate human rights or international law. Such an approach needs to be applied to Israel in light of events in Gaza, but should also be applied to any other countries committing war crimes or human rights violations.\nThe demands of the students protesting on College Green were just by any reasonable standards. The University refused offers of mediation by several members of the Philadelphia City Council. Penn's actions do not enhance public safety and will produce a chilling effect on free speech in the future. I call on Penn to drop any charges against the students involved in the encampment, and apologize to the community for excessive use of force.\n\tI am currently a Platinum-level alumni donor to Penn. I am currently serving on the alumni admissions committee, and I am active in the Penn and Wharton clubs of Chicago. I will continue to support the University, but I want to reiterate how very disappointed I am in Penn's response to this crisis.\nGEORGE HONIG is a 1987 Wharton graduate.

          "article_content": "The Gaza Solidarity Encampment was disbanded on May 10.We are members of Penn Faculty Against Antisemitism (PFAA) who write to express our concern about the recent events on our campus; namely, the increase in discord within our community. First, we would like to thank Interim Penn President Larry Jameson and the administration, Penn Police, Philadelphia Mayor Cherelle Parker, and the Philadelphia Police Department for the effective, efficient, and professional clearing of the encampment to return our campus to a safe place for all students and faculty.\u00a0\nNobody wants our students to be harmed, and we do not wish to penalize anyone who is practicing their right to free expression. However, we are hopeful that the University will engage in a thorough and fair disciplinary process to ensure that students and faculty who are not adhering to the code of conduct face appropriate consequences for inciting hate and creating a threatening campus environment. This should apply to anyone fomenting hate and encouraging destruction of property. We recognize that many of these people are not students on this campus. We condemn any further escalation, especially by non-Penn agitators, and look forward to a safe and meaningful conclusion to the academic term, including long-awaited graduations, commencement, and class reunions.\u00a0\n\t\tWe welcome civil and respectful discussion. We advocate for the release of the hostages and elimination of Hamas and other organizations funded by terrorism as a critical goal to achieve in reaching an end to this war. We cannot move on as a community until we can come together as a community. The entire country is heartbroken that it has come to this with many of the college encampments, but the only way forward is to choose dialogue and understanding over hate. We are all working for a better present in hopes of creating a better future.

          "title": "Letter to the Editor | To DP reporters & photographers, we take you seriously",
          "article_content": "I often teach capstone research courses and supervise honors theses for the health & societies major. Some of my students use historical methods to answer their research questions. Occasionally, a student asking a historical question will explore The Daily Pennsylvanian's archives. My students have experienced surprise, delight, and sometimes shock when combing through old DP articles and learning about local, national, and international issues important to previous generations of Penn students.\nOver the past two weeks, I, like many other Penn faculty members, have deeply appreciated the professionalism and commitment of our student journalists. DP journalists have reported tirelessly about the encampment on our College Green.\n\t\tI was stunned, therefore, when I got to campus around 7:30 a.m. today, to see that police were not allowing DP reporters inside the barricade to report on the encampment removal. I asked two DP reporters and one DP photographer, who were being blocked by a line of police officers with batons, why they weren\u2019t being allowed in. \u201cThey don\u2019t take us seriously,\u201d one reporter replied. Meanwhile, I saw a reporter for a network news channel allowed to head up Locust Walk to College Green.\nA Philadelphia Inquirer article reported later today that another DP journalist, who arrived at College Green at 5 a.m. before the dismantling of the encampment began, was \u201cgrabbed by two Penn police officers and moved back from the statue. \u2018I kept saying I was a student and a member of the press,\u2019 the reporter said. \u2018I kept on asking why I wasn\u2019t allowed to be there, and I would get no responses.\u2019\u201d\n\t\t\n\t\nWhile I assume that at some point, the police must have allowed some members of the DP inside the barricade, I just want DP student journalists to know that I take you seriously. The faculty I have spoken to about the encampment over the past couple of weeks take you seriously. Historians take you seriously. Generations of future scholars take you seriously.

          "article_content": "Professors Ann Farnsworth-Alvear and Zita Cristina Nunes urge us to read Penn\u2019s Guidelines on Open Expression, arguing that it would be a perversion of those guidelines for the University to discipline students organizing the encampment on College Green, or to take any measures to end the encampment other than negotiation with the protesters. I have taken their advice and read those Guidelines and find nothing that mandates negotiation as the only appropriate response by the University.\nFarnsworth-Alvear and Nunes cite the part of the Guidelines that states that \u201cIn case of conflict between the principles of the Guidelines on Open Expression and other University policies, the principles of the Guidelines shall take precedence,\u201d (Guidelines I.D), but they interpret this as if it meant that no University policy may be enforced if it restricts open expression by students. This is a misreading of that clause since that document itself makes reference to disciplinary procedures (Guidelines V.D) and mandates the University establish policies and procedures for securing permission to hold demonstrations on campus (Guidelines III.A.2.b). As I read Interim Penn President Larry Jameson\u2019s letter to the Penn community on May 6, the University has determined that the current encampment on College Green is in violation of those policies and procedures (among others), and has instructed the encampment to disperse (in line with Guidelines III.B and V.C). Since the protesters have not complied with this instruction (thus falling under Guidelines III.B), the disciplinary procedures invoked in Guidelines V.D come into play. The Guidelines also discuss the possibility of \u201c[t]erminating a meeting, event, or demonstration by force,\u201d (Guidelines V.C.4), about which it urges extreme caution, citing the possibility of exacerbating existing tensions, and the concern to avoid \u201cinjury to persons\u201d and \u201cproperty damage.\u201d\n\t\tMy point is that the University\u2019s current response to the encampment, which involves initiating the student disciplinary process against organizers yesterday, and using police to shut down the encampment this morning, is in line with its own Guidelines for Open Expression.\nSUSAN SAUV\u00c9 MEYER is a retired professor of philosophy.

          "title": "Ben Messafi | The encampment is self-destructing ",
          "article_content": "More than one week into the encampment on College Green, with over 150 incidents of antisemitism and harassment reported to Penn Hillel, the public endorsement of two United States-designated terrorist organizations, and two American flags planted near the encampment being forcibly removed and damaged by protesters, students have had enough. It is time to end this antisemitic and anti-American encampment now.\u00a0\nOn April 26, pro-Israeli and Jewish students sponsored a screening of the Oct. 7 massacre adjacent to the Button on campus, broadcasting the screen in the direction of the encampment. Standing just outside the encampment when the video was playing, I heard three protesters clapping and cheering as a video of an Israeli woman getting raped and paraded in the streets of Gaza was displayed. The night before, I spotted a protester wearing a sweater with a Star of David and two rats depicted on the back, which imitates Nazi-style propaganda from the 1930s.\u00a0\n\t\tThe following night, protesters were recorded cheering \u201cAl Qassem make us proud, take another soldier down.\u201d Al Qassem is the military wing of Hamas, the group behind the Oct. 7 rape, mass murder, and abduction of Israeli civilians that has contributed to the deaths of thousands of Israelis and Palestinians since it took control of Gaza in 2007.\u00a0\nLast Tuesday, I walked near the encampment and saw a large PFLP (Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine) flag flying, which is a U.S.-designated terror organization. PFLP has been behind numerous terror attacks against Israeli civilians, including the hijacking in 1976 that diverted a flight leaving Israel to Entebbe, Uganda, and the raid of a Jerusalem synagogue, killing four in 2014. PFLP also opposes all negotiations with Israel and only envisions a Middle East without a Jewish state.\n\t\t\t\tEven worse, Penn\u2019s anonymous social media app, Sidechat, has been filled with an increasing number of pro-Palestinian supporters at Penn speaking out against the encampment, citing the diversion of the encampment from the values of the protest. Instead of protesting for the establishment of a Palestinian state and the end of the war, the encampment has turned this movement into an antisemitic cesspool, where students cannot walk on campus with Judaica items without being harassed by protesters. Even worse, not all members are students. When I attempted to look inside the encampment several days ago, I was approached by two protesters acting as \u201cguards.\u201d They did not name themselves, but they both acknowledged that they were not students, just Philadelphia residents with no association to Penn. Why should people outside of the Penn community have the ability to use Penn property to sleep and harass Jewish students? Why are non-Penn affiliates determining who is and who is not allowed on parts of our campus?\nOn April 29, pro-Palestinian protesters stormed Hamilton Hall at Columbia University, shattering the front windows and taking one security guard hostage. NYPD then forcefully removed the protesters, facing instant backlash. With Columbia's administration being hesitant to clear up the protest, students were able to easily obtain access to the building and vandalize it. As the protests at Penn are continuing to radicalize, the administration must follow through on their promise to clear the encampment before it is too late. Penn could be next.\u00a0\n\tSupporting the encampment and the groups they endorse is preventing any meaningful action and dialogue from occurring at Penn. Instead of speaking to diverse groups of students about their experiences with the conflict, the encampment is choosing to invite individuals outside of the Penn community to come to Penn and harass Jewish students. Instead of inviting leaders of the Jewish community to speak with students on the other side to discuss issues and common ground, the Chabad rabbi is being denied entry into the encampment because he is visibly Jewish. Instead of making Jewish students willing to talk to pro-Palestinian protesters about points of common ground, Jewish students are being harassed with Nazi-era rhetoric and praising of terrorist organizations that want to annihilate Jews from this planet.\nIf we want real action and dialogue to occur on this campus, continuing to support an encampment that has turned into an antisemitic hatefest continuing to harass Jewish students is not the answer. There is room for dialogue, there is room for peaceful protest, and there is room for change. There is a difference between a peaceful protest to endorse a cause, and cheering for terrorist groups that actively call for the elimination of Jewish students. Harassing Jewish students is not the best method to get community members to support your cause. Enough is enough.\nBEN MESSAFI is a College first year studying economics and political science from Westchester, N.Y.
